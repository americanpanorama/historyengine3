      <h2>Staff and Sponsors</h2>
      <p>The <cite>History Engine</cite> has been developed by the staff of the University of Richmond&rsquo;s <a href='https://dsl.richmond.edu/' target="_blank">Digital Scholarship Lab</a>, with important contributions from the <a href='http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/' target="_blank">University of Toronto Scarborough</a> (UTSC) and building upon work first done at the University of Virginia.</p>
      <p><strong>Robert K. Nelson</strong> directs the project. Coding of the current version of the <cite>History Engine</cite> was completed by <strong>Nathan Altice</strong>, <strong>Clay vanSchelkwij</strong>, and <strong>UTSC Information and Instructional Technology Services</strong>. <strong>Nate Ayers</strong> and Altice designed much of the site.</p>
      <p>UTSC led a recent reimplementation of the spatial components of the <cite>History Engine</cite>. <strong>Christine A. Berkowitz</strong> and <strong>Perry Sheppard</strong> served as project leads for that initiative.</p>
      <p>The <cite>History Engine</cite> was initially developed at the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Virginia Center for Digital History in the mid 2000s. It was the brainchild of <strong>Edward L. Ayers</strong>, <strong>Andrew Torget</strong>, and <strong>Scott Nesbit</strong>. Torget and Nesbit served as former co-directors of the <cite>History Engine</cite>.</p> 
      <p>The <cite>History Engine</cite> has evolved from and built upon the work of a number of individuals. <strong>Joel Garrett</strong>, <strong>Tom Lawrence</strong>, <strong>Shawn Starkey</strong>, <strong>Bill Covert</strong>, and <strong>Adam Soroka</strong> all did some programming on earlier versions of the <cite>History Engine</cite>. <strong>Rachel Shapiro</strong> served as a project manager; <strong>Chris Gist</strong> as a geospatial analyst; <strong>Megan Bersani</strong>, <strong>Amanda Kleintop</strong>, <strong>Kathleen Lietzau</strong>, <strong>Tiffany Laney</strong>, and <strong>John Osteen</strong> as research interns.</p> 
      <p>The most important part of the <cite>History Engine</cite>&#8212;the episodes themselves&#8212;are written and contributed by undergraduate students at different colleges and universities in North America, working with their faculty instructors. Three historians&#8212;<strong>Lloyd Benson</strong>, <strong>Julian Chambliss</strong>, and <strong>Kathryn Tomasek</strong>&#8212;have used the <cite>History Engine</cite> repeatedly in their classes and provided valuable feedback that has improved this project substantially.</p>
      <p>We are grateful to UTSC and <a href='http://www.nitle.org/' target="_blank">NITLE</a> for grants they provided to help develop the <cite>History Engine</cite>.</p>
