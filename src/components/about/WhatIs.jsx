      <h2>What is the History Engine?</h2>
      <p>An active project from 2008 to 2019, the <cite>History Engine</cite> aimed to enhance historical education and research for teachers, students, and scholars alike. It allowed undergraduate professors to introduce a more collaborative and creative approach to history into their classrooms, while maintaining rigorous academic standards. The core of the <cite>History Engine</cite> project were student-written episodes&#8212;individual snippets of daily life throughout history from the broadest international and national events to the simplest local occurrences. Students constructed these episodes from one or more primary sources found in university and local archives, using historical context gleaned from secondary sources to round out their analysis. Students then posted their entries in our cumulative database, giving their classmates and anyone else who's interested the opportunity to read and benefit from their work.</p>
      <p>The <cite>History Engine</cite> also gave students a more intimate experience with the process of history. Participants who worked with the <cite>History Engine</cite> project learned the craft of an historian: they examined primary documents, placed these documents in a larger historical context using secondary sources, and prepared cogent analysis of their sources for the public eye. These students went into the project fully aware that future classrooms would engage with and critique their work.</p>
      <p>Finally, the <cite>History Engine</cite> provided a way for professors to take advantage of digital technology in their classrooms. The cumulative database provided and still provides all the easy-access and searchability of other websites, but also subjected its contents to a careful academic screening process from insructors as well as librarians, archivists, and teaching assistants. Because only registered students could contribute, each episode was carefully vetted for content and accuracy. Therefore, the contents of the <cite>History Engine</cite> also provide a previously untapped resource for researchers and academics in general. Student episodes draw from a wide variety of primary documents in both small and large collections from around the country, many of which have yet to appear in scholarly manuscripts.</p>
      <p>While no longer actively growing, the thousands of episodes researched and written by students over the life of the project can still be read and explored by anyone interested in learning more about the past.</p>
