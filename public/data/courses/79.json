The black and white or sepia pictures display dirty children, tired mothers or men hard at work. Every one was broke and tired. This era, known as The Great Depression, lasted from 1929 through the advent of the Second World War. This was a time of struggle for people from all walks of life. Even people from white-collar fields, such as lawyers, librarians and teachers were unable to provide for their families. The New Deal program <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA)felt that there was a more productive way to use the unique skill set that these people brought with them than put them to work on the construction crews created across the nation. The resulting effort was <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration Federal Writers’ Project and Historical Records Survey.</em>","This project was the result of several meetings that took place in 1934 between Jacob Baker, the assistant to the chief of the Civil Works Administration and his assistant, Katherine Kellock. The <em>Works Project Administration </em>ultimately created four appendages to protect and sustain the arts: the <em>Federal Writers' Project</em>, <em>the Art Project</em>, the <em>Theater Project</em>, and the <em>Music Project</em>.","By 1935, <em>The Federal Writers Project </em>was up and running. The main goal of this project was to create a series of guidebooks and local histories. Championed by Kellock, The <em>American Guide Series</em> and “<em>America Eats</em>”were a result of this project. Other collections include the narratives of former slaves as well as celebrations of local culture and art. Even though these projects collected invaluable history, one of the many issues the faced was the collection and intake process. In addition, there were many bureaucratic hurdles that could not be resolved.","Many in Congress felt that the money used to fund the many WPA writers and art programs could be used elsewhere. With the impending threat of war, many Congressmen were intent on diverting those funds to the defense budget. Before the program was terminated in 1939,<em> The Federal</em> <em>Writers Project </em>compiled an impressive collection of pamphlets, books radio scripts and transcripts. These histories are stored in many places on the Internet such as The American Memory Collection."],"locations":[{"id":22390,"lat":40.7455449451,"lng":-84.936600608,"zoom":10,"place":"Adams, Indiana"},{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1220,"tag":"Federal Writers' Project"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

It was a version of the nineteenth-century English folk song <em>\"Long, Long Ago\".</em> Lew Brown and Charles Tobias wrote the lyrics and the song debuted in the 1939 Broadway musical Yokel Boy. It was written as a pledge of loyalty between two young lovers while one of them is away serving in the war.","After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Brown and Tobias modified the lyrics to their current form, with the chorus ending with \"...'till I come marching home\". In February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor, the Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the song with vocals by Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, and The Modernaires. In May the song was featured in the film “<em>Private Buckaroo” </em> as a performance by the Andrews Sisters with the Harry James orchestra. The Andrews Sisters then released the song on Decca Records. Many other artists released records of the song that year, including Kay Kyser.

Roosevelt will forever be remembered for his public contribution to our nation during the Great Depression years. However, the confidence FDR exuded publically was also used in a more private nature. Late in 1913 Lucy Mercer was hired by Eleanor Roosevelt to act as a social secretary and as such she managed any of the paperwork and social affairs of Eleanor. When FDR first saw Lucy, she was arriving for work as he was leaving for his office in the Navy Department and it was not long before he took to greeting his wife’s secretary with, “Ah, the lovely Lucy.”","This was the beginning of what became a long term romance. Lucy began to accompany the family to more and more social events, serving as the extra woman at the table meant to entertain foreign ambassadors. What began as simply an employee and employer relationship blossomed into a love affair. Franklin, who had loved traveling to Campobello, the family’s summer home, now began to drag his feet about joining Eleanor and the children. Instead he remained in Washington while encouraging Eleanor to stay longer and taking trips on his boat with Lucy.","Eleanor’s suspicions were further aroused after Franklin wrote to her of a trip to the birth places of Robert E. Lee and George Washington. Lucy was among the list of passengers and despite her apparent coupling with Nigel Law, a British diplomat and friend to FDR, the implications of Lucy’s real reason for being aboard were obvious. The next week Eleanor fired Lucy from her secretary position with the family. However, five days following her dismissal from her post, Franklin hired Lucy as a secretary in the Navy Yard allowing the two to remain in contact with one another.","The following summer Roosevelt again dragged his feet in joining his family at Campobello. Eleanor for her part attempted to avoid leaving for the family’s retreat, while at the same time begging Franklin to join them. While Eleanor remained at Campobello, Franklin arranged another sightseeing trip with Lucy again on the guest list. This stalling, followed by summer jaunts with Lucy were to become the norm for Franklin’s summers. He placated Eleanor with a day or two of his time, however there was always an excuse for him to return to his bachelor summers.","Soon Eleanor’s suspicions were confirmed. FDR, just returned from a trip to Europe during World War I, failed to remove the correspondence between him and Lucy from his suitcase. Eleanor discovered them and threatened to divorce Franklin, effectively ending his political career. FDR was saved only be his charm and the fact that Eleanor had a political agenda of her own that could ill afford the stigma of divorce. Also there were the children to be considered. Franklin promised to end the relationship with Lucy who eventually married, however she always loved Franklin and they continued to write to one another long after the affair had ended up until FDR’s death."],"locations":[{"id":16493,"lat":42.6001926046,"lng":-73.9735779487,"zoom":9,"place":"Albany, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1282,"tag":"Affair"},{"id":1283,"tag":"FDR"},{"id":1284,"tag":"Lucy Mercer"}]},{"id":5391,"title":"The Banjo's Role during the Great Depression.","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/44","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The banjo is a string instrument with a sound unlike any other. It made parlor room music for the upper middle class and was a part of the Great Depression and has continued on into the years as a recognizable instrument. The banjo was sought by many because of its strange high tempo songs that were played on them. In the Tennessee Valley country farmers would get together after working all day in the fields and play to pass the time like Uncle Dave Macon.  Uncle Dave Macon played for so long and so well that people started to gather to watch him play music. Later in life he would even be paid. Uncle Dave Macon was born David Harrison Macon in Tennessee on October 7, 1870. During the 1920s when Uncle Dave was 50 years old he was paid $15 by friends for entertainment during the evening hours. Author and music historian for Rutherford County, Charles Wolfe, described Macon “as a character” before he ever set foot on the Grand Ole Opry stage or produced recordings with his talented banjo skills and his bear claw pick.","The banjo’s popularity can be attributed to the common farmer and his love for the instrument. The banjo was a valuable entertainment tool that allowed them to play as much as they liked to pass away the time on the front porch. During the 1920s the banjo gained popularity because it was portable, easy to learn on and musical dueling matches were played like checkers or chess. By the late 1926 the phrase “hillbilly music” describing the banjo was published in <em>Variety</em> magazine.  This “hillbilly music” was viewed by most Americans as “more southern folk music” which was typical of describing familiar tunes on the fiddle, harmonica and banjo. The booming popularity of the radio in the 1920s made southern folk music noticeable and, as a huge contributor to that type of folk music, the banjo became a status symbol of the southern music."],"locations":[{"id":21882,"lat":35.8426844848,"lng":-86.4167102519,"zoom":9,"place":"Rutherford, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1279,"tag":"banjo"},{"id":1278,"tag":"music, folk"},{"id":1158,"tag":"Great Depression"}]},{"id":5359,"title":"<strong>CHOLECYSTOGRAPHY - - The contrast media dye used for x-rays.</strong>","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/23","end_date":"12/31/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Dr. Evarts Graham developed cholecystography whereby ingestion of a contrast media dye allowed a visual image to be captured by an x-ray.  Graham's research led him to the position of being the 10th president of The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Also known as the M1 Garand it was a gas operated, bolt action rifle that was massed produced for the military by subcontracted companies located across the country. The original design of the bolt that made this weapon uniquie was created by none other than a prisoner who developed the idea of a gas operated bolt action rifle with a locking chamber.","Parts were forged from eight difference manufactures. Manufactures included Springfield Armory, Harrington & Richardson, and International Harvester and when interchangable parts from these diverse companies were assembled they created a fully functional weapon.","The War Department contracted the first model (M1) Garand to be used by the United States Military.  With each M1 that was issued to a solider, a Technical Manual was also issued to aid in the operation, maintenance and specifications of the carbine. The Technical Manual 9-1276 dated March 24, 1947 was a standard issue manual that accompanied the rifle.","This .30 caliber M1 rifle is a “clip-fed, gas-operated, air cooled, semiautomatic shoulder weapon” as stated by the military training manual. A separate cartridge of a standard load of eight rounds slides into the top of the receiver to create a combat action fast loading rifle. This was the first model being produced with a gas-operated chamber that allowed a redirection of the expanding gas that is produced from the round to be diverted into a small receiving tube that opposes a piston that drives a bolt backwards. By driving the bolt of the weapon rearward this allows for the extraction of the round to become automatic and when the piston is returned to the forward position a new round is chambered completing the cycle of a single round and a loading of a new .30 caliber round. A single round is sent down range for ever depression of the trigger.  It was said by General George S. Patton, Jr. that it was “the greatest battle implement ever devised.”","The successful use of this new battle tool changed the way that the military viewed its importance in the field of fire, i.e. the battle zone. Its clip fed capability allowed for more ammunition to travel down range in the most efficient means possible-traveling fast, and with more potency then the combatant’s antique weapons. This is one of the first most photographed weapons in the U.S. military. The use of the gas-power driven bolt is still being used in weapons around the world. With its simple mechanical system it has been reused in many different weapons across the world. Its action with reaction system allowed for fast reloading and created reliability for a solider."," "],"locations":[{"id":23783,"lat":39.7582179873,"lng":-89.6589400672,"zoom":9,"place":"Sangamon, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":1154,"tag":"M1"},{"id":1155,"tag":"Carbine"},{"id":1156,"tag":"TM 9-1276"},{"id":1157,"tag":"FM 23-7"}]},{"id":5361,"title":"Dorothea Lange and Social Documentary during the Great Depression","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"3/1/36","end_date":"3/1/40","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Her young child sits at her feet, eating the dirt that covers so much of their existence.

Paul Whitman asked George Gershwin to write a jazz concerto piece mixing jazz and classical music to shock the   musical community. Whitman wanted to shake things up and grab the public’s attention! Gershwin was not real committed nor in a hurry to write it until his brother Ira picked up a copy of an early January 4, 1924, addition of the <em>New York Tribune</em>. The article “<em>What is American Music?</em>” made mention of his commitment to Whitman’s requested jazz concerto piece. He was not pleased of this mention because he had not decided on making the commitment.","                The next day he put a call into Whitman discovering that if he did not write it, the opportunity would expire. Gershwin agreed.  Little did he know that his decision would change how he was viewed by the world forever. On January 7, 1924, on a train headed for Boston “Rhapsody in Blue” was born. Gershwin said “<em>It was on the train, with its steely rhythms, its rattle-ty bang, that is so often so stimulating to a composer – I frequently hear music in the very heart of the noise... And there I suddenly heard, and even saw on paper – the complete construction of the Rhapsody, from beginning to end. No new themes came to me, but I worked on the thematic material already in my mind and tried to conceive the composition as a whole. I heard it as a sort of musical kaleidoscope of America, of our vast melting pot, of our unduplicated national pep, of our metropolitan madness. By the time I reached Boston I had a definite plot of the piece, as distinguished from its actual substance.”-Gershwin</em>","<em><br /></em>               “Rhapsody in Blue” was written with urgency due to its premiere date set for February 12, 1924. He finished the piano scores only weeks before the debut. Gershwin quickly handed them over to be orchestrated by Paul Whiteman’s arranger Ferde Grofe, completing 8 days before its premiere. Gershwin’s piece debuted on February 12, 1924, at Aeolian Hall in New York City. It was “An Experiment in Modern Music” featuring composers of the time period like Sousa and Rachmaninoff. The concert was an educational experiment bringing symphony and opera to the masses. “Rhapsody in Blue” marked Gershwin a serious composer of his time. To date there are only two recordings of Gershwin performing in live concert. He went on to rewrite and improve his original piece but it simply did not compare to the first piece.<br /><br /><br /><br />"],"locations":[{"id":19456,"lat":40.5763036462,"lng":-74.2034374021,"zoom":11,"place":"Richmond, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1275,"tag":"Gershwin,Rhapsody in blue"},{"id":1276,"tag":"jazz, classical music,"},{"id":1277,"tag":"composers"}]},{"id":5430,"title":"The Great Jack-Rabbit Roundup","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/35","end_date":"12/31/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When one thinks of the Dust Bowl one normally envisions the swirling dust, the storms, the poverty, and the despair. A little discussed consequence of the Dust Bowl was the effect that it had on the wildlife. An ever decreasing food supply was driving the jack-rabbits out of their native habitats and forcing them onto the plains in rapidly increasing numbers. Once on the plains these rabbits began to destroy what little that the dust and storms had not already done in.","In an effort to control the rapidly increasing numbers of the jack-rabbits, whole communities came together and began to organize large parties in which the jack-rabbits would be systematically eliminated. Initially they used shotguns, but this became dangerous due to the large number of people that turned out to these “hunts”. Eventually it was decided that they would use clubs to avoid further injuries. This switch in weapons was very effective as there were so many jack-rabbits that one could simply wade into a large group and start swinging their club and kill the rabbits. Members of the party would start out in a circle, sometimes as large as a mile in circumference and begin to walk towards the center, driving all the jack-rabbits caught within the circle toward a pen. Once enclosed in the hastily erected pen, the jack-rabbits were easy targets for the club wielding locals.","The photo that was used for this episode is one taken at a Kansas jack-rabbit round up and depicts a few men with their clubs herding the jack-rabbits toward the pin. These gatherings became a sort of social activity in which friends and neighbors gathered and talked. Although the task was gruesome, the camaraderie was admirable and served to solidify rapidly disintegrating communities. The men in the photo are smiling, laughing and joking, which was something rarely caught in photographs at this time. The jack-rabbit round ups were an escape for those in rural communities, much like films were at this time, and despite the disturbing nature of the activity were a relief from the troubles experienced in the dust bowl."],"locations":[{"id":22196,"lat":37.1932870529,"lng":-100.851305615,"zoom":9,"place":"Seward, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1285,"tag":"Rabbit Drives"},{"id":1286,"tag":"Jack Rabbit Roundup"},{"id":1287,"tag":"Kansas"},{"id":1288,"tag":"Dust Bowl"}]},{"id":5431,"title":"Jazz Boom!","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/29","end_date":"1/1/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American country was in turmoil. People were starving for work and relief from the Depression. Franklin D. Roosevelt was struggling to regain control of the plummeting economy and the people were worn. Any distraction offered to these hard working masses was widely accepted. Music, for many, was seen as brief respite from the difficulties of their daily life. Along with FDR’s fireside chats, music was being aired into an increasing number of homes on a regular basis.","As part of Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, <em>Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA) began collecting art and music and exposed the nation to an evolving style of music, jazz. Evoking an emotional response from the audience, jazz music, reminiscent of African American spirituals, had become popular in many urban areas allowing the music industry to endure during the years when so many industries struggled to stay afloat. Changes  in musical style occurred around 1935 in conjunction with technological advances in for both film and audio technology. In addition, the New Deal program, <em>Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA) began collecting art and music and exposed the nation to the ever-evolving style of music.","Many of the WPA’s contributing artists gained fame during this era leaving a lasting influence on the nation’s music industry. The impact these people made on the cultural history of The United States and its music[btm1]  is enduring. For example, Billy Holiday, known as Lady Day, came to the forefront of the music scene in 1935, when she became vocalist for major orchestras such as Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm. Count Basie had worked with other such greats as Louis Armstrong, another influential jazz musician. Armstrong, also known as Satchmo, a shortened version of Satchel Mouth, began playing cornet as a young man elevating himself in the industry  becoming a great trumpet player and singer. Often in demand during the Depression, Armstrong made his first trip to Europe in 1932.","The recording and film technologies as well as that of jazz music itself progressed during this period. Benny Goodman was a well-established radio and studio musician who combined forces with other musicians to focus on a purely jazz sound rather than popular tunes. Securing a contract to perform on the radio show “Let’s Dance” catapulted his sound to stardom with the crowning achievement being the first-ever jazz concert at New York’s prestigious Carnegie Hall.","Following Goodman’s successes with Swing Jazz bandleaders began to feature more jazz arrangements, styles and solos ushering in a new genre of music that is still evolving today."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"locations":[{"id":19406,"lat":39.9878097372,"lng":-91.1885648416,"zoom":9,"place":"Adams, Illinois"},{"id":20995,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"Orleans, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1290,"tag":"Satchmo"},{"id":1289,"tag":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":471,"tag":"music"},{"id":1291,"tag":"Swing Jazz"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1085,"tag":"WPA"},{"id":997,"tag":"Billie Holiday"},{"id":959,"tag":"Jazz"}]},{"id":5434,"title":"“The Baby Faced Mad Man of Highway 12”","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/34","end_date":"11/27/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) named 1934 “The Year of the Gangster” as the agency had killed John Dillinger, Homer Van Meter, Bonnie and Clyde, and Charles Arthur “Pretty Boy” Floyd.
