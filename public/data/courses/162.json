The Tampax company, using J. Walter Thompson & Co. advertising company, introduced its tampon to the public with a print ad in a widely read magazine on October 15, 1937. The advertisement was aimed at active women in the 13—45 age bracket. The ad had a distinctly medical slant to give credence to the product so that women would feel comfortable knowing that it was medically sound.  The ad used phrasing such as “the medical tampon used by physicians,” “perfected by a doctor,” and “recommended by gynecologists.”","The advertisement also emphasized “such comfort and freedom that they [women] are unaware of its presence.”  The ad stressed “with Tampax you wear no belts, no pins, no pads.” This coincided with the attitude that was at last becoming the norm for women—independence. Not only was it freeing, but a woman could now place her attention on her new-found independence in social circles by telling us, that it is “[p]ractical even during dancing, sport activities, taking a bath” and having “such freedom and comfort that [women] are <em>unaware of its presence!</em>”","Throughout history various methods of managing monthly blood flow have been used. For instance, in the Roman Empire cloth bandages were used by civilized members of society while “their savage sisters in Africa and Australia used bandages made of grass or vegetable fiber.” In ancient Japan women vaginally inserted layered paper held in place with a bandage.  “The commercial tampon as we know it has been shaped and re-shaped by a myriad of invisible forces—like genuine concern for women’s wellness, certainly, but also sexism, panic, feminism, capitalism, and secrecy.” Up until 1925, American women wore a diaper-like garment made of flannel, which they washed and reused. They were bulky and uncomfortable. In 1896, a sanitary napkin was manufactured by Johnson and Johnson but was withdrawn from the market because advertising this type of personal product was not seen as socially acceptable because of the terse morality of the day. There was a lot of puritanical discomfort with the concept of women touching themselves in any way in their genital area. “People thought that tampon use was inappropriate because it might break the hymen . . . and might be . . . pleasurable and might be a way for girls to experience orgasmic pleasure.”","Historically, tampons had been documented in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They were used for purposes other than menstrual management. In 1776 a French doctor describes tampons which were “tightly rolled, vinegar-soaked linen that was used to stem the flow of hemorrhage and leucorrhea.”  In the late nineteenth century Dr. Paul F. Munde, an accomplished gynecologist, described eight distinct uses for the tampon; number eight was “the absorption of vaginal and uterine discharges.\"","It was in World War I that French nurses discovered that the bandages they used to stop the bleeding of wounded soldiers could be used by menstruating women. The material was more absorbent than the cloth diapers that were used at that time. Slowly, women’s personal products came out of the closet.  Attitudes began to change as women flooded into the work force and became increasingly independent.  Advertisers picked up on this and Tampax went on to become “one of the great game-changers in twentieth century periods.”"],"locations":[{"id":52909,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":3078,"tag":"tampon"},{"id":3079,"tag":"tampons"},{"id":3080,"tag":"Tampax"},{"id":3081,"tag":"Tampax tampons"},{"id":3082,"tag":"period"},{"id":3083,"tag":"women's periods"},{"id":3084,"tag":"menstruation"},{"id":1849,"tag":"Advertisement"}]},{"id":6563,"title":"Jacob Singer's Automatic Car Coupler","course_id":162,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-06-09","end_date":"1876-01-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the early parts of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the United States experienced a boom in growth.  Not only in population and the size of the territory, but also in regards to manufacturing and technological innovation.  Great accomplishments and breakthroughs were achieved in manufacturing, the efficiency of factories, communication, as well as transportation.  In many instances these innovations were the direct result of trailblazers, who through their own foresight and genius were able to completely change the way we looked at the world and the possibilities of how things could be done.  Innovation happened quickly and important concepts, such as safety, were of little concern to the folks pushing the limits of what science and technology had previously deemed possible.  Safety didn’t necessarily equate to profitability so many times this was an afterthought and required government regulation to step in and curb the enthusiasm of these early American entrepreneurs.  In those places we then found new innovations, not in regards to efficiency, but in terms of ensuring these technologies did not operate in such a way that human lives were put in danger.  The early railroad system was one such area where safety breakthroughs were constantly lagging behind the expansion of the network.  The two leading dangers to trainmen, riding and coupling cars, reflected a peculiarly American evolution of the freight car” (Aldrich 104).  The innovation outlined below was one piece of many, which hoped to allow safety to become something that was more of a priority and in the forefront of railroad discussion, rather than the afterthought it had once been.","            Jacob Singer was one such inventor who saw an issue with the construction of trains, as well as the process of connecting one car to the next using the couple system.  Singer and his colleagues set out to develop an automatic car coupler, which would remove the need of manually connecting one car to the next by the train crew.  This process was extremely dangerous and could easily lead to accidents, which resulted in loss of limb and even death. “The subject of automatic car coupling, its utility and necessity, has been so thoroughly considered, that at present any dissertation on the importance of saving human life and limb will be unnecessary” (Singer 1).  Once, they created their own version of a coupler, which would work automatically, a patent was filed for and approved on June 9, 1874, as well as subsequent patents in 1875 and 1876. (Singer 1).  He then had a pamphlet published in 1876 to advertise this safety breakthrough and offer it for sale to the railroad agencies.  “The right to manufacture and use these Car Couplings is for sale for the whole United States, or such Territory parties may desire” (Singer 1).Singer, like any great entrepreneur was looking to target railroad manufacturers and market his new invention.  The US Patent system of the time allowed him to sell these items directly, or more importantly, sell his design to manufacturing companies and collect a royalty off of this invention for a predetermined amount of time.  During the nineteenth century, this was the way inventors were able to market their niche products and brand new innovations so that word could spread quickly and personal profits could be maximized, while they still held the exclusive patent rights afforded to them by the United States Government.      ","             This invention was one of many, which were designed, out of necessity, to address the gross lapses in railroad safety measures during the nineteenth century.  “Though Congress had required that freight trains have self-couplers and large numbers of continuous brakes by the opening year of the new century, the number of deaths and injuries due to coupling and braking had remained at appalling levels”(Usselman 316).  As the rate of railroad usage increased so did the rates of injuries and fatalities.  The Federal Government began passing laws and regulations to attempt to make these modes of transportation safer.  The first piece of Federal legislation was passed in 1838 in response to the rash of boiler explosions in steamboats. “Congress succeeded in enacting two groundbreaking pieces of legislation-one in 1838 and the other in 1852-that tackled the steamboat issue head-on” (Sandukas 3).  Singer’s publication was one way for word to spread that there were inventions available to railroad manufacturers that could begin to decrease the number of accidents and casualties, but without public pressure and increased government oversight and enforcement, railroad companies would be less likely to make any changes to their processes, which may increase production costs and therefore negatively affect profitability.  “Either was the conclusion was the same: death on the rails was a common occurrence.  While such figures underlay the widespread popular concern with railroad dangers in the decades before World War 1, train accidents involving passengers dominated public concern” (Aldrich 3).  Similar to the forces, which eventually caused automobile manufacturers to focus on safety measures in the twentieth century, big business and government agencies would not be as quick to act, if the public outcry for reform did not begin to mount and reflect the added pressure of the general public to see that their loved ones were being properly protected and cared for when using these brand new technologies.  These issues were common throughout the Industrial Revolution.  Profits were always held in much higher regard than the overall welfare of the workers and general public.  The interests of the investors, and therefore the profitability of the company, was the only driving force behind innovation and changes to manufacturing processes.  However, over time, as the general public became more aware of the simple safety measures that were widely available and not being put into place by these large corporations the rumblings of discontent and the winds of change could no longer be held at bay.  “With each new railroad accident, meanwhile, a fresh outcry would arise from the pages of newspapers and periodicals, and fill the halls of the country’s governing bodies” (Vogel 216).","With each year that passed and the use of railroads increased, it grew clearer and clearer that government intervention was the only way these private businesses would relent to the public demand for accountability and the enforcement of safety regulations, which had been passed, but had not been put into practice.  Eventually, the railroads realized that changes needed to occur and Singer’s along with countless other safety innovations would begin to be put into production so that the railroads could be seen as a safe place to work and travel.  Only then would public opinion change and full confidence be placed in this new form of transportation.  “By the time of the 1892 presidential campaign, when the candidates from both major parties advocated safety legislation, railroads recognized that the growing public support for legislation dwarfed any opposition they could muster” (Usselman 291).

1948, Westinghouse placed an advertisement in <em>Time Magazine</em> describing a new model of radio, referred to as their 186 version of the radio phonograph.The advertisement was geared towards families encouraged to purchase the push button console radio.  The advertisement depicted father and mother dancing with their children around the radio.  The advertisement stated, “You can be sure if it’s a Westinghouse”.  Through this advertisement, Westinghouse presented itself as a credible business selling FM radio receivers.  Its mission was to get consumers to buy their particular brand of radios.  The message that Westinghouse implied in the advertisement was that by buying this particular radio model, consumers would enjoy listening to the music and sounds that came from the machine.  To separate its radio phonograph from those produced by competitors, Westinghouse concentrated on the craftsmanship of the device, including the fine wood cabinet that housed the radio components.   The noted that the speakers placed in the wood would provide the best quality of sound.  The cabinet would also provide room for storing records and other items.  As the advertisement demonstrated, the 186 model was not only powerful, but sound quality could be heard in and around the house. "," ","The primary purpose of the 186 radio phonograph model was to enable users to enjoy broadcasting news, entertainment shows, and music.  The Westinghouse receiver and record player stood about three feet tall and three feet long.  The wood was stained with a dark brown color with a polyurethane finish for a noticeable shine.  The knobs were easy to turn for best results to search for the stations that would interest family members.  The radio console appeared to have some sort of tan padding at the bottom.  Some consumers who bought the radio likely believed that it would bring warmth and color to their living room.  The radio phonograph could be placed anywhere in the home.  The ad also showed flowers placed on the top of the radio, along with a newspaper.  Westinghouse claimed that their radio would be different than any other radio at that time.  They also mentioned that the radio was available in different models.  Consumers like to see good advertisements when purchasing anything. The content and the pictures that help tell a story entice someone to purchase.  Westinghouse’s strategy of placing the advertisement in <em>Time Magazine</em> was wise since it was widely read and thus allowed many readers to see the product. "," ","Wireless communication has been around since the days of Reginald Fessenden, who took this approach by sending voice through the telegraph and this was called telephony.  Electromagnetic waves are everywhere and Fessenden developed a way to use this technology and to send voice through signals to link them to radios.  Before Fessenden could get started, Guglielmo Marconi sent sounds through the telegram to help ships communicate to each other for safety.  Since then wireless communication has evolved into many different technology devices such as cell phones, satellite radios, and high definition televisions.  Westinghouse played an important part in developing radio broadcasting and reception technology and encouraging the spread of radio broadcasting stations as well as the emergences of consumer radios. "," ","Radio today carry many different company names; however, radios are perceived a one of the major sources of information since they enable people to listen to news, sports, entertainment, and weather broadcasts.  Just about every household has some type of radios in their possession.  The auto industry makes it mandatory and a requirement to install radios in their cars and trucks.  Most radios are more sophisticated and difficult to operate.  The new radios in the automobile come with apps and a navigation system to help the driver reach their destination.  In conclusion, Westinghouse radios bonded families together with their music to keep everyone happy.  Radio technology delivered broadcasting to mass audiences around the country to build relationships and connect to people.  Radios are one of the most powerful and attractive devices man has ever made, and will continue to develop new ways to satisfy customers in the United States and abroad.  Technologies became ready for companies like Westinghouse to be one of the leaders in manufacture of radios and other devices with financial resources to maintain company fame to produce different communication devices for years to come.   Westinghouse’s goal was to become the leading company in the industry.  Its 1948 advertisement for the model 186 radio promised users enjoyment and entertainment that they could share with family and friends."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","References"," "," “You can be sure if it’s a Westinghouse.”  Ad retrieved from"," ","              library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess/?keyword=westinghouse+radio"," "," "," ","Barboutis, C.

The execution proved that a man could be killed deliberately by using electricity as a means of death. Kemmler’s execution and its aftermath are detailed in an article published by the <em>New York Times</em> on August 18, 1890, under the title, “Warden Durstons Record: The Man Who Bungled the Kemmler Execution” ","            Kemmler killed his mother on March 29, 1889, with an axe and was sentenced to the death penalty on May 13, 1889. William was sent to Auburn Prison in Buffalo, New York. Eight years earlier, Buffalo dentist Alfred Southwick had conceived of the idea of using electricity to execute people. Lawyers for Kemmler appealed the electrocution death sentence because they claimed electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment. The appeals process went on for 18 months. An article in the <em>New York Times</em> described the execution in detail. There were seventeen people in the crowd at the execution. Kemmler was strapped into the chair and a metal device was put on his head. It was assumed that 1,000 volts would be needed to induce unconsciousness and cause cardiac arrest. After 17 seconds at 1,000 volts, he was still breathing. Two-thousand volts was applied the second time. Blood vessels popped under the skin and some claimed that he even caught on fire. A nauseous smell filled the room and was described as smelling like something burning. The execution was successful, but it did not work out the way it was planned. Critics of the electric chair claimed that they were right, while advocates argued that it was a new technology that needed further refinement.","            The development of the electric chair took place at the same time as the “War of Currents” fought between the Edison Electric Light Company and Westinghouse Electric Company. Thomas Edison believed that direct current (DC) was the safest form of electricity while George Westinghouse believed alternating current (AC) was the safest. Both of these companies were very powerful and made many false claims about the form of electricity the other advocated. They also made many claims about why their system was safer. Westinghouse did not want his generators associated with the death penalty so he would not sell them to prison officials. New York State commissioned Harold Brown to build the first electric chair. Edison secretly financed Browns project because he wanted the electric chair to run on AC. In the end, Westinghouse and his direct current won the race and proved to be the most efficient for means of execution.","            After a series of failed public hangings, the Gerry Commission was formed [BS1] in 1886 to find a more humane form of capital punishment. The death penalty commission was made up of three different people, Alfred P. Southwick, Elbridge Thomas Gerry and Matthew Hale. Questionnaires were sent to officials, lawyers, and medical experts to ask for their opinion. The questions were swayed towards electrocution and did not include abolishing the death penalty. Edison recommended AC to be connected to the head and spine. Dogs and other animals such as horses were used as test subjects. It was also recommended that states deal with electric chair executions instead of individual counties. The Medico Legal Commission was set up to figure out the best method and how much electric to use for execution. The commission was made up of a panel of doctors. Since animals were used as test subjects, the effects of the device on humans could not be anticipated with certainty.  Three-thousand watts of electricity was recommended to cause a quick death.","            The electric chair was highly controversial when it was introduced and the belief continued for almost 100 years. Capital punishment has many advocates and many critics. Lethal injection has replaced the electric chair in terms of the preferred way of death but it is still a choice in several states."," "," ","Works Cited","1.      <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/edison-vs-westinghouse-a-shocking-rivalry-102146036/?no-ist\">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/edison-vs-westinghouse-a-shocking-rivalry-102146036/?no-ist</a>"," ","2.      <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-execution-by-electric-chair\">http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-execution-by-electric-chair</a>"," ","3.      “Warden Durstons Record: The Man Who Bungled the Kemmler Execution”","New York Times, 18 August 1890"," "," "," "," [BS1]when?"],"locations":[{"id":52949,"lat":42.847399,"lng":-78.644965,"zoom":7,"place":"Buffalo, NY- Auburn Prison"}],"tags":[{"id":2231,"tag":"Death Penalty"},{"id":3091,"tag":"Electric Chair"}]},{"id":6566,"title":"The National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984","course_id":162,"status":"P","start_date":"10/19/84","end_date":"10/19/84","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" "," The United States Congress along with President Ronald Wilson Reagan passed the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) on October 19, 1984. The act authorized the federal Department of Health and Human Services to maintain and establish clear property rights for both deceased human corpses and living donors with regards to organ donation and transplantation. These rights meant that there would be a federal ethical standard when it came to receiving money as an incentive to donate organs and ensured that no one person would be able to make a profit from the practice.","The National Organ Transplantation Act’s structure is categorized into four titles; ","Title I - Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation","Title II - Organ Procurement Activities","Title III - Prohibition of Organ Purchases","Title IV - Miscellaneous"," The document, under Title III states “It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce”. If this law is broken, repercussion can lead to fines of up to $50,000 dollars. The main goal of this regulation was to keep organs from ending up on the black market. Compensating donors could lead to a downward spiral for the organ transplant system as we know it., and lead to a system where organization and equality does not exist and third party individuals may even make commissions or profits from organs sold. The ethical concern for respecting human body parts or deceased remains was an upmost concern of legislators in Congress."," The shortage of organs was at an all-time high in 1983 and the demand for transplantation was growing at an accelerated speed. The National Organ Transplantation Act provided a solution to the problem and established a structure for the United States transplantation system, along with influencing other systems by setting a precedent around the world. "," NOTA established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) as a system or framework for organ donation. This system is in part reputable and maintained due to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The goal of UNOS is to maintain a system where the trend is to increase the number of transplants yearly while shrinking the wait list for organs. UNOS sought to improve outcomes of wait-listed organ recipients and donors or matches who are donating their organs to family members or strangers."," The National Organ Transplantation Act, while holding much weight in ethical standards and consideration for the future of the donor/recipient, has undergone much scrutiny over the past thirty years for not being progressive and for taking away organ donors’ financial incentive. The argument is that it can be virtually impossible for elective donors to donate because they are unable to take off from work for recovery, hence why compensation may be an incentive to shrink the organ waiting list. Advocates for NOTA believe that UNOS is involved in making the transplantation process a smooth one with fair and equal opportunity for all in the who participate in the process such as the donor, recipient, even family members who are directly related."," "],"locations":[{"id":52836,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3094,"tag":"Act"},{"id":3093,"tag":"Organ Donor"},{"id":3092,"tag":"Organ Transplant"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}]},{"id":6567,"title":"The Dawn of Refrigeration","course_id":162,"status":"P","start_date":"11/1/28","end_date":"0000-00-00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the late 1920s and early 1930s, household refrigeration was seeing improvements that would encourage more and more Americans to add this piece of technology to their kitchens. In this particular advertisement, published by General Electrics in the late 1920s, they were trying to sell their all-steel refrigerators. General Electric used the idea of food safety and reliability to push the importance of their product. In one respect, GE pulled at the heartstrings by discussing the safety of refrigerated food for a family, yet they also were business savvy and discussed that repairs were virtually unnecessary. A GE model of refrigerator was an obvious choice for any reasonable family. "," A huge concern at the time was potential illness in the family due to food spoilage. The GE advertisement actually mentions that, “Physicians agree that 50 degrees is the danger point. Above that temperature, bacteria multiply alarmingly.” This advertisement was making sure that families, particularly housewifes, were concerned with keeping their food at a safe temperature. In his book, Refrigeration Nation, Jonathan Rees also discusses how important food safety was to the refrigerator consumer. "," Refrigerators were not completely trusted at this time. People were used to costly repairs, so GE was trying to prove that their new model was efficient and worth the cost. As Rees pointed out, “Much of the advertising centered on the inadequacy of the refrigeration technology that came before electric refrigerators, namely, the ice industry.” This reassurance was seen in the advertisement when it mentioned that, “There are more than 350,000 General Electric Refrigerators in use and no owner has ever spent a single dollar for repairs or service.” "," This increase in efficiency was caused by new technology. There were compressors and seals that were developed at this time that ensured the new refrigerators would be superior to their predecessors. There were advances in ammonia compressors and the way they were able to work made them much more reliable and easy to use in the everyday home. This improvement in technology was intended for the purchaser of the refrigerator, generally the man of the house. While the advertisement showed a woman and her child, GE knew that the person making the final decision was the man who purchased the refrigerator, and so needed him to be convinced of its’ worth. "," During this time refrigeration was being converted into the now standard household refrigerator, but many people still used an ice box with daily ice deliveries to maintain their food from spoiling. General Electric and other companies had to be aggressive with their advertisements to convince families that they needed this new technology to improve their quality of life. GE knew that they needed to not only discuss the benefits of keeping the food safe, but also the ease of use. People no longer had the constant expense of paying the iceman, but they had to stress that there would not be excessive repairs that would in turn make the refrigerator more costly. "," Refrigeration was not a new technology, but a compact household self-sufficient refrigerator certainly was a new concept in this technology. With these advertisements, refrigerators became the norm in many American households. People were impressed with advertisements and wanted to try this technology for themselves. This exciting new technology and promising advertisements coupled with the new lower prices of refrigerators made the industry boom. By 1928, the number of refrigerators sold grew exponentially for a total around 468,000; another attestment to how important refrigerators were becoming.

Harry Ward, the author of a<em> </em>1912<em> Washington Times</em> article, provided a glimpse into motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson’s integral role in building bikes for endurance rides. On Sunday, October 13, 1912, Washington area motorcycle enthusiasts participated in the National Capital Motorcycle Club’s endurance race. As the article noted, unlike in previous years, inclement weather had a significant affect on the number of participants in the event. Still, nine riders participated in the first endurance run. To no one’s surprise, the two Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the race finished with perfect scores. ","Harley-Davidson became an icon for perfect scores in endurance races. According to Ward, the world famous Harley-Davidson motorcycle became known as “The King of the Road,” and even more, gained a positive reputation as “100% Perfect,” or “The Greatest Endurance Motorcycle on the Market.” Harley-Davidson motorcycles had earned a perfect 1,000 point score at the Seventh Annual Federation of American Motorcyclists Endurance and Reliability Contest just four short years earlier, which only added to the prestige that this American motorcycle manufacture has already earned.","Harley-Davidson quickly emerged as a builder of reliable, quality motorcycles after Milwaukee residents William S. Harley and Arthur and Walter Davidson started it in a shed in 1903. Not long after, the company adopted a logo that would become recognizable just about anywhere, the “Bar & Shield,” which was created in 1910. The firm concentrated on building reliable machines that could handle endurance rides. The perfect finish that a couple of Harley-Davidson riders earned in Washington on October 14, 1912, came as no surprise. Originally, Harley-Davidson started out with a single cylinder engine, as that is what they could fit on the bike frame. It would not take long for the team to introduce an engine that would be able to produce more power; therefore adding a second cylinder, the v-twin. Named for the 45-degree angle at which the cylinders were configured, this design would become an icon of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The firm’s v-twin model, which came out it 1909, proved to be quite successful. As business ramped up with each subsequent event victory, so did the need for a much larger manufacturing facility. The small shed producing motorcycles in Milwaukee in 1903 soon grew into a six-story manufacturing facility. The factory manufactured bikes, as well as spare parts and accessories. Not only did the American motorcycle manufacturer gain immense popularity in the United States, they also secured their first export to Japan in 1912. ","Harry Ward’s article in October of 1912 not only shed light on just how popular the “King of the Road” would become, but helped to publicize the dependability that this machine offered in endurance races. Constantly looking for new innovative designs, Harley-Davidson upped the ante with their iconic v-twin motor and offered spare parts, which was a first for the company. By branding the motorcycle with distinct “Bar & Shield” logo, people would begin to associate Harley-Davidson with endurance and victory. Dominating the industry, and a true recognition of their reliability, Harley-Davidson became a major supplier to the military. In fact, in WWI more than half of the motorcycles produced by Harley-Davidson were purchased by the military. Motorcycle clubs began to pop up everywhere, and to this day, the legendary Harley-Davidson continues to flood the market with remarkable success."," "],"locations":[{"id":52950,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":3100,"tag":"Harley-Davidson"},{"id":3098,"tag":"Harley Davidson"},{"id":3099,"tag":"Motorcycle"}]},{"id":6570,"title":"The Purchase of Alaska","course_id":162,"status":"P","start_date":"8/15/16","end_date":"8/15/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","In 1867, the United States of America purchased a land area known as Alaska from Russia. With this purchase, the United States completed its westward, continental expansion and largely dominated the North American Continent. The purchase was agreed upon on March 30, 1867, for $7.2 Million dollars. “For less than 2 cents an acre, the United States acquired nearly 600,000 square miles” (para 1, ourdocuments.gov)."," ","             As the United States expanded westward in the early 1800s, Americans soon found themselves in competition with Russian explorers and traders. “St. Petersburg … lacked the financial resources to support major settlements or a military presence along the Pacific coast of North America and permanent Russian settlers in Alaska never numbered more than four hundred. Defeat in the Crimean War further reduced Russian interest in this region” (para 1, History.stae.gov). In 1859, the Russian Government reached out to the Americans and offered to sell the land of Alaska to them, however, due to the looming Civil War in the United States, the sale was delayed (para 2, History.state.gov). Once the Civil War was over, the American Secretary of State William Seward, once again pursued a potential agreement with the Russians. On October 18, 1867, six months later after the purchase, Alaska was formally transferred to the United States. With this purchase the presence of Russia was no longer felt in North America. With this vacancy of Russia, it ensured the United States access to the northern Pacific."," ","            On May 12, 1867, the Honorable Joseph S. Wilson, Commissioner of the General Land Office, wrote a letter to Congressman Nathaniel P. Banks, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, detailing the importance and future benefits to having purchased the landmass of Alaska. “The acquisition of this territory is essential to the full success of that career of wonderful progress upon which the United States have lately entered” (para 1, loc.gov). Joseph S. Wilson describes how the continental position of Alaska allows the United States of America, influence in that region and how its close proximity to the continent of Asia will be beneficial. For centuries, it has been the ambition of western nations to be in contact with the Far East, and with America acquiring Alaska, they are closer than any other western nation. Mr. Wilson states that “England, Denmark, Sweden, France and Germany are contemplating and organizing movements, looking to the exploration and occupancy of the unappropriated northern regions of this continent-movements which it becomes us to watch with jealously and promptly circumvent” (para 2, loc.gov)."," ","            A common misconception of Alaska during the Nineteenth Century was that agricultural production would not be possible due to the weather and harsh terrain. Mr. Wilson addressed this point by describing the crops that could be grown there, “Potatoes, turnips, cabbages, and other hardy vegetables have been successfully cultivated by the Russians. Many of the islands are covered in abundant grass. Berries and fruits have also been raised in considerable quantities” (pg 2, loc.gov). Not only could Alaskan land be used for agricultural production, but the region was also home to a thriving fur-trade industry, as well as possessing valuable stands of timber and mineral deposits. For years, the Russians discouraged miners from investigating the land and disrupting their fur trade industry. Now with the United States in control of the land, miners could search for mineral deposits. This includes gold, silver, copper, and iron (pg 2, loc.gov)."," ","            The purchase of Alaska from Russia, by President Andrew Johnson truly transformed the United States of America. It led to great wealth, and extended our country to the Northern Pacific. With the United States of America fully controlling all corners of the North American continent, the government was then able to focus its message to providing and expanding democratic values."," ","Reference Page"," ","Check for the Purchase of Alaska.
