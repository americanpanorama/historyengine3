Kennedy’s family, political career, personal life, and assassination continue to occupy the imagination of Americans. What is it about this man, his presidency, and even his personal life that compels such interest? In this class we will use a critical lens to examine JFK’s family history, opportunities, obstacles, politics, and style as well as the people and initiatives he embraced. We will consider how JFK’s presidency should be assessed and what his political and personal journey can teach us about leadership. There are all different ways to frame and evaluate history. In this class, we are considering a famous individual and examining his ancestry, family, politics, and life experiences to learn more about the past and to further develop writing, research, presentation, and information literacy skills.","points":[[38.911387,-77.03062],[38.9071923,-77.0368707],[38.8976763,-77.0365298]],"bounds":[[38.911387,-77.03062],[38.8976763,-77.0368707]],"episodes":[{"id":6802,"title":"Cardinal Cushing, JFK, and the Religion Hurdle","course_id":183,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/66","end_date":"1/30/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“I was convinced if anyone could break through that wall of prejudice, our best hope was with John F. Kennedy. More than any other Catholic of the twentieth century, he was capable of facing this Herculean challenge.”  ","In 1966, Richard Cardinal Cushing, a close confidante and spiritual adviser to John F. Kennedy, sat for an oral history with Edward M. Kennedy. Cardinal Cushing first encountered John F. Kennedy during his campaign for Congress and said that he remained a steadfast influence in the young President’s life until his untimely death. Cushing attested that Kennedy called and visited him frequently to discuss a range of subjects, from federal aid to education to current events. In his interview with Edward M. Kennedy, Cushing described and evaluated the main conflicts Kennedy faced regarding his Catholic religion.","Cushing declared that some citizens undoubtedly did not vote for Kennedy solely for his Catholicism and he admitted that some in the Catholic hierarchy felt the time had not yet come for a Catholic’s election to the presidency. In sharp contrast, Cushing extolled Kennedy’s ecumenical spirit, which meshed with the reforms associated with the Second Vatican Council. Cushing likewise noted Kennedy’s “liberal rather than conservative Catholicism” and many “qualities of mind and heart” made him the only Catholic with a chance to obtain the highest office in the land.","Cushing stated that Kennedy’s faith never obstructed his relationships. Yet Kennedy’s faith and allegiance prevailed as a topics of heated controversy during his campaign and presidency. During his interview with Cushing, Edward M. Kennedy mentioned a highly-publicized incident regarding the Chapel of Four Chaplains in Pennsylvania, where Kennedy encountered harsh criticism for neglecting to attend an interdenominational service. Cushing said this was just one of hundreds of similar conflicts. This specific episode, however, continued to follow Kennedy, despite his insistence that he did not attend solely because “he was not credentialed to be a representative of the Catholic church,” according to historian Shaun Casey.","Kennedy’s Catholicism gave rise to other concerns, including fears that he would advocate to send an ambassador to the Vatican. Cushing considered this an “absurd objection” and proclaimed that he knew no one in the U.S. Catholic hierarchy who supported that initiative. Yet a group of Baptist ministers in St. Louis passed a resolution that encouraged Kennedy to send Cardinal Cushing himself – “Mr. Kennedy’s own hierarchical superior in Boston” – to obtain the Vatican’s authorization on Kennedy’s position regarding the separation of church and state. Casey wrote that a move like this would have presented Kennedy as submissive to the Vatican. Kennedy firmly denounced this appeal, reiterating that he felt strongly that his position mirrored those of most American Catholics.","As for federal aid to education, Cushing never passionately supported the cause, fearing that parochial schools would become subject to some federal control. But Cushing affirmed that Kennedy felt private or parochial schools deserved a place in the U.S. educational system. Kennedy even believed these schools should receive “some kind of aid that had no relation to religion,” as long as this motion would align with the Constitution. Historian Thomas Maier wrote that during a debate surrounding a 1950 federal aid-for-education bill, Kennedy openly argued that parochial schools should receive aid, at least for buses and health services.","Cushing told Edward M. Kennedy how he officiated the late President’s wedding to Jacqueline Bouvier, visited during one of Kennedy’s near-fatal hospital stays, gave the only prayer offering at Kennedy’s inauguration, and attended the funeral masses of both Patrick Bouvier and the President himself. In all the time that he knew the President, Cushing said he never once saw any evidence that an allegiance to the Vatican had influenced Kennedy’s loyalties to the presidency. In fact, he considered Kennedy “the greatest representative of brotherhood...we had among the laity.”","<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"],"locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.911387,"lng":-77.03062,"zoom":7,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3561,"tag":"Richard Cardinal Cushing"},{"id":3563,"tag":"Vatican"},{"id":3562,"tag":"Edward M.

Kennedy exuded airs of confidence, courage and strength to the American public. At his inauguration ceremony on a frigid January day, Kennedy appeared resilient as he stood in front of the large crowd without a jacket, hat or gloves. His capability was rarely questioned throughout his years in office, but behind the healthy image he portrayed was a lifelong struggle with crippling disease and discomfort.","The most prominent of Kennedy’s ailments was Addison’s disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the adrenal glands do not properly produce hormones to combat infection. He also suffered from chronic back pain, serious allergies and digestive tract problems. In an effort to remedy his illnesses, Kennedy took an array of medications, at least seven each day. He took Meticorten, hydrocortisone, Florinef, synthetic T3, and Cytomel, among others. He had four operations done on his back, all of which proved ultimately unhelpful.","Kennedy’s personal physician was Janet G. Travell, a Cornell Medical School graduate and internal medicine specialist. In an oral history transcript, she talked about her first encounter with Kennedy on May 22, 1955. She described his poor condition in saying, “He was thin, he was ill, his nutrition was poor, he was on crutches. There were two steps from the street into my office and he could hardly navigate these.” His most significant complaint was of lower left back pain. She eventually treated his pain using local injection of procaine or novocaine at trigger points, a method she was renowned for. She worked tirelessly to make Kennedy as comfortable as possible, even making recommendations on the kind of chairs he should sit in. The idea first came about when he commented about a rocking chair in her office in New York. Travell recalled, “He sat in it and he said, ‘This is so comfortable, why can't I have one of these?’ I said he could.” Soon enough the rocking chair became a staple piece of furniture in the White House.","The exercise plan suggested by another one of Kennedy’s other doctors, Dr. Kraus, produced drastic improvement in the President’s condition. In the Travell interview, she explains, “He started… on a regular exercise program with Dr. Hans Kraus, which did him an inestimable amount of good.” Regular swimming, golf and tennis allowed him to build and strengthen important muscle groups in his legs and back, providing significant relief over time.","While skilled doctors extensively examined Kennedy to assess his health, the President never wanted the public to perceive him as weak. Travell admitted to working with Kennedy to censure the medical information available to the press. She recounted one conversation they had after Kennedy was hospitalized saying, “I tried to persuade him that we should just say he had a small abscess on his back. He said, ‘You know, that’s a very ugly word. I don’t want to have an abscess.’ So we compromised on a virus infection.” Despite the plethora of medical issues Kennedy suffered from, Travell thought his health was “more than adequate for him to carry the duties and responsibilities of the presidency.”","It is widely perceived that Kennedy’s poor health did not significantly affect his skillfulness and competence as president. In a tragic example of irony, he was in the best health he had been in years at the time of his death. The youthful and dynamic image Kennedy maintained was impressive, but in light of the daily physical challenges he faced in addition to the duties of the presidency, John F. Kennedy is a more outstanding political figure than previously imagined."],"locations":[{"id":52869,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, D.C.

She created the image of a successful woman; rather than the stereotypical dependent and obedient women in the early 1960s. Most importantly, Jackie Kennedy served as a role model for women.","On February 14, 1962 Jacqueline Kennedy conducted a TV tour of the newly restored White House. Not only did she single handedly start the restoration, overseeing everything from wallpaper in the Monroe Room to china in the State Dining Room, she also presented the renovated rooms of the White House with knowledge and poise, intermittently providing historical context. The hour-long CBS special symbolized something greater than just presenting artifacts of American history to its viewers, it communicated that Jackie Kennedy was more than just Jack Kennedy’s wife. Through White House restoration, Jackie publicized her movement away from dependence and toward initiative and progress. Whether she intended directly or not, Jackie Kennedy provided women with a newfound inspiration for change; change that was well overdue.","President Kennedy was introduced at the tail end of the tour, and for once, it is to support the First Lady in her endeavors, rather than the reverse. “Being educated, having some knowledge your husband didn’t have, was glamorous, even enviable” according to Media Studies Scholar Susan Douglas. It was refreshing, revolutionary and important to young women in the United States at that time to see that a woman, not only a man, could do something great, something “magnificent” as R. M. Frisby states in a letter to the First Lady. Her voice, as Historian Gil Troy states, is “thin” with an “upper-class accent.” Her hair was done perfectly and her wardrobe, as always, superb. Not only was her appearance untouchable, but her knowledge as well. She articulated “beautifully sculpted grammatical sentences” and “compelling facts” throughout the televised special, creating an intimacy between the viewers and herself.","Troy recounts “reporters hailed the First Lady for transcending the typical polarities of gender and marriage.” Jacqueline Kennedy established a new interpretation of societal roles, one that spoke directly to females. The second youngest First Lady, only 31 years of age, according to Douglas was a “one-woman revolution” and this statement holds true as seen through the appreciative letters sent by citizens regarding the success of the White House restoration."],"locations":[{"id":53140,"lat":38.8976763,"lng":-77.0365298,"zoom":17,"place":"The White House"}],"tags":[{"id":3565,"tag":"White House Restoration"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":2848,"tag":"First Lady"},{"id":2847,"tag":"Jacqueline Kennedy"}]}]}
