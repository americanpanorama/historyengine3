More importantly, the morale and efficiency of troops was dependant on the fact that these food and munitions were particularly good. For this reason, the food rations provided to American soldiers were specifically monitored by the Army Medical Corps in an attempt to ensure their superiority over the supplies of the German or Japanese troops. The significant resource cost of the war made it difficult to ensure a fresh supply of food and beverages was getting to the front line or being available to the workers back at home. According to the US Army, American soldiers consumed about nine million pounds of food daily. This meant that a considerable amount of food had to be brought to the battlefront which would be nutrient rich, in eatable condition, and available quickly. The American soldier's ration was made up of easily mass produced, canned, and shipped goods such as beans, packaged meats and vegetables, soluble fruit drinks, chewing gum, and cigarettes.","Though the American soldier's rations were processed and not freshly made, the availability of genuine, vitamin-rich food should not be taken lightly. The Germans and Italians, by comparison, had trouble supporting their troops and munitions workers with food in the same way. The production capacity of the United States was colossal and was not subject to the same stipulations as some of the European powers. The Germans were largely dependent on domestic food resources which, while enough to survive on, could not provide both soldiers and munitions workers with enough nutrients to remain at full efficiency. As a result, the Germans suffered a loss in the supply of food and munitions due to worker malnourishment while the Americans were able to provide for the Allies.  Winston Churchill is even quoted as having said \"We have won the war!\" after hearing of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, knowing well the industrial power of the United States.  During war time, the importance of efficiency and support of the home front should not be underestimated, and it is without a doubt that well-fed and nourished soldiers and workers have a distinct advantage over their malnourished counterparts. People under the Axis often had to eat substitute \"sawdust\" food and rely on foods which engineered specifically for mere survival, and this was a clear advantage that the United States brought to the Allies.","The importance of steady and healthy food supplies was not lost on the United States, and the great economic advantage of the nation has always been something which could be exploited. After World War II, the Medical Corps continued to improve the supplies received by American soldiers, upgrading the synthetic food drinks of wartime into instant coffee, and providing a wider variety of meat as well as pastas and treats such as cookies to the troops.  Well nourished troops are very important to a war effort, and there is no doubt that the superior food rations of the Allied troops, particularly those of the United States, helped in part to ensure victory over the Axis. <br /><br /> <br />Works Cited: <br /><br />Merriman, John M.

Unfortunately, in spite of the three attempts for an anti-lynching bill that successfully passed through the House of Representatives, it continued to fail in the Senate. Lynching was protected under the Constitution as it protected the right of local government to control crime thus giving them freedom from interference or scrutiny.","The early twentieth century was the era of ‘The Declaration of Principles,’ a call to “restoring to ‘blacks’ the right to vote, an end to racial segregation, and complete equality in economic and educational opportunity”  created under the leadership of W.E.B. Du Bois, being adopted in 1905. Yet, as African Americans began to show assertiveness and independence, racial tensions were amplified and whites reacted in violence, in order to maintain their white supremacy.  Horrifically, more than 5,000 African Americans were lynched by white mobs between 1882 and 1932, with the express purpose being to “terrify ‘Negroes’ as to dissuade them from ever asserting themselves or their rights.” Incredibly, the lack of concern over the murder of thousands of African Americans was because whites believed that their lives were cheap and “inherently and permanently inferior,” to the point of being as low in value as animals. In fact, lynchings were committed by respected and regular citizens and celebrated as social events attended by families. The real horror about this period in American history is that, regrettably, racism would continue to raise its ugly head for three more decades before many of the African Americans dreams for true freedom and equality would begin to be realized through the crusades led by Martin Luther King, Jr.  <br /><br />"],"locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"}]}]}
