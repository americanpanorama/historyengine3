Former state senator Thomas GrimkÉ felt this action was completely uncalled for. Although likely in the minority of his peers, he was not alone in this belief. GrimkÉ believed that nullification, far more than being an overreaction to the tariffs, was a step taken against the Republic. ","    Possessing such strong feelings about the nullification doctrine, GrimkÉ took it upon himself to fight back by informing the citizens of South Carolina of the threat that such a doctrine posed. In his pamphlet, \"To The People Of The State Of South Carolina,\" published December 1, 1832 in Charleston, GrimkÉ addressed these dangers. Claiming that \"no other age, no other country, no other men, have ever struck such a blow at Liberty,\" GrimkÉ warned the citizens of his state that \"if they [the state convention]...imitate the example of the Ordinance, there is nothing they cannot, nothing they will not do, which they may judge necessary.\" GrimkÉ, against the idea of nullification itself, was more concerned with the idea that South Carolina, a state \"committed to their [the Federal government's] jurisdiction by a <em>joint</em> act of the States,\" had no constitutional right to nullify any action or law of the Federal government. He felt that if the state were allowed to ignore any law put in place by the National government, then the entire Union was threatened. GrimkÉ, like many politicians, wanted to keep the Union together. As he explained in his pamphlet, \"South Carolina is <em>not a Nation</em>;...she is but a <em>district</em> of one great Nation.\" And it was for the sake of this \"great Nation\" that Thomas GrimkÉ fought strongly against nullification in South Carolina."],"locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}]},{"id":3829,"title":"Stolen Away: Slave Children\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-04-12","end_date":"1841-04-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            Beverly Randolph of Powhatan, Virginia carefully planned her last will and testament to divide equally her assets amongst her children. In the late 1830s, Mrs. Randolph divided ownership of several plantations and a considerable number of slaves in her will. The bulk of her slaves went to her son Charles, but Beverly spent extra time dividing slave children to her other designated heirs, noting, \"to my daughter Lavinice I also give a girl called Caroline and a boy called Richard, the former the child of Maria and the latter a child of Fanny...\" This casual reference of forcibly removing children from their families reflects the fragile position of slaves, especially children, in the plantation South.","            While some planters gave the impression that they cared for their slaves and did their best not to separate families (especially children and their mothers), in most cases, simple economics won out over good intent. Records of slave traders indicated that sometimes 25 percent of their overall sales were of children sold individually in order to make the most profit. The division of slave families was also a regular occurrence when an owner died and passed his or her slaves down to their heirs or designated slaves to be sold in order to pay off debts. As in Beverly Randolph's case, children were completely separated from both of their parents in order to equalize her daughter's inheritance with no regard for the personal welfare of the slave mother or child. This unique vulnerability of slave children lent itself as one dark aspect of slavery, the destruction of a child's family despite the supposedly well-intentioned owners.

A seat of racial tension, particularly because of an established African American population that controlled many prestigious government and military positions, Hamburg had undergone nearly eleven years of Reconstruction that had, in the opinion of South Carolinian Sam Aleckson, brought some \"tranquility to the state and people.\" Nonetheless, the success of Reconstruction (especially in Hamburg) was blemished when a white Ku Klux Klan mob assaulted a black militia group led by South Carolina National Guard Captain Doc L. Adams. ","    At the time of the incident, Adams' regiment had been parading legally on the streets of Hamburg in celebration of the Fourth of July. Two white men, Messrs. Henry Gatzen and Thomas Butler, approached them and instructed them to move to the side of the road, which they did begrudgingly. This action, however, was not enough for Mr. Butler, and he reported the militia company for \"obstructing the highway\" to the local trial justice, Mr. Prince Rivers, who printed out a warrant against Capt. Adams. This action Mr. Butler carried out in accordance with South Carolina law. The second action Mr. Butler took, however, was much less lawful. Butler related the stubborn response of the militia company to his cousin, General M.C. Butler (an ex-Confederate general and a participant in Ku Klux Klan activities), who took the law into his own hands, demanding that the militia company turn over its legally-held weaponry as well as summoning an armed mob from Augusta, Georgia, to assault the black National Guard regiment.","    Soon after, Butler's mob forced the militia men into a local house and threatened to blow up the house with cannon fire. Weary of this threat, the militia company escaped the building, but was unable to evade General Butler's mob, which murdered five and severely wounded three of the captured African Americans. This violence occurred for no other reason than the company's immediate refusal to move from a public road.","    The Hamburg Fourth of July incident, while cheerless in outcome, portrays race relations in South Carolina during Reconstruction, specifically whites' blunt refusal to end antebellum traditions and accept society's newly freed members. Regrettable though it is, this was the true Reconstruction South, one that had not changed as drastically as emancipation had demanded."],"locations":[{"id":11507,"lat":33.8449766897,"lng":-81.9100531274,"zoom":8,"place":"EDGEFIELD, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}]},{"id":3832,"title":"Keeping the Family Together\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-12-03","end_date":"1837-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            \"If you can't send all, pray be so good to send for me and my son Harrison,\" Matthew Watts wrote to his mistress Elizabeth Brown in December 1837.  Owned by a wealthy family in Kentucky who sent him to Virginia for a brief period of time, Watts awaited the opportunity to return home with his son for over a year.  During his time in Campbell County, he \"lost\" his wife and daughter as well as most of his financial viability.  Unable to afford the price of the journey back to Kentucky, Watts wrote to Brown to ask for more money.  He expressed concern about the dissolution of his family, mentioning the state of a fellow slave mourning the sale of his son to another plantation owner.  Yet Watts also made use of his time away: he visited friends of the Brown family, fulfilled his slave duties, and also tried to find a new wife.  Family played an important role in the lives of slaves, but slaveholders could easily break a family apart.","            In the 1830s South, slavery was an institution valued as a source of economic wealth and production.  When it became financially advantageous to sell a slave, or when a slave became an economic burden for his or her owner, the majority of slaveholders had few reservations for selling their slave to someone else.  Historian Wilma A. Dunaway notes that despite a strong emphasis on the family as an emotional and physical support in plantation culture, masters \"devalued the human characteristics of their slaves\" in order to justify breaking up slave families.  While it is unclear how Watts lost his wife and daughter, the urgency he expressed at the thought of losing his son reflects his fear of existing without a family.  ","            Yet Watts also knew of the potential danger in saying too much to his mistress.   As John Blassingame writes, slaves often held back much of their emotion from their masters for fear that their masters would take advantage of or chastise them.  Throughout his letter, Watts flattered his slave-owning family and made them aware that he fulfilled their orders while in Virginia.  The fact that he reserved a place in his letter to ask that his family remain together highlights the immense importance of kinship and the ease with which it could be shattered.  Watts' gender also played a major role in the probability of separation from his son.  Mothers rather than fathers were more likely to remain with their young children because it increased the chance of their children's survival.  Thus, despite his distance from Kentucky and his possession of a small amount of money, Watts knew that he was still at the mercy of his masters.  His experience as a slave was even more difficult because he was a father."],"locations":[{"id":13697,"lat":37.2395751117,"lng":-79.0668919579,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":3833,"title":"Staunton Citizens Make Excursion with Various Temperance Organizations\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-07-11","end_date":"1876-07-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["      In July 1876 the various temperance organizations of the city of Staunton, Virginia organized a day-long excursion by train involving between two and three hundred citizens, almost all of whom were organization members.  The day was filled with an atmosphere of goodwill and entertainment.  According to the local newspaper, <em>The Spectator</em>, upon arrival at the excursion's destination \"[t]he day was pleasantly spent in amusements and games of different kinds-ten pins, croquet, dancing, &c.\"  Such activity was a relatively common feature of the temperance movement in the American South after the Civil War.  The main goal of this movement was to eliminate, or at least reduce, alcohol consumption among the populace.  According to historian Thomas Pegram, the movement was filled largely with women who often engaged in public, grassroots activities to spread their message.  Lacking the right to vote and often appealing to the idea that they were the moral authority on the domestic scene, such women saw public action as an important way to express their ideals.","      Other broad trends in the post-Civil War South contributed to increased emphasis on temperance.  Historian Jack Blocker Jr. has noted that, especially in areas where economic growth was more rapid and the idea of the \"New South\" held sway, people began to realize that traditional drinking patterns were not compatible with the new culture of economic progress and productivity.  Many saw temperance as a step toward advancing the South into modernity.  In this context one can understand the positive manner in which <em>The</em> <em>Spectator</em> described the local temperance excursion: \"Many persons will remember the temperance excursion to Millboro with a great deal of pleasure so long as they shall live, and we hope they may all live to enjoy many more such occasions of joy and hilarity.\"  In using such words as \"pleasure,\" \"joy,\" and \"hilarity\" to describe this event, the editors of the Staunton<em> Spectator</em> displayed a sense of approval for what these temperance organizations were doing."],"locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}]},{"id":3840,"title":"A University of Virginia Student Responds to John Brown&#39;s Raid\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-11-03","end_date":"1859-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    E.M. Healy, a student at the University of Virginia in the years surrounding 1859, wrote a letter to his brother in Urbanna, Virginia on November 3.  He was eager to explain to his family an event that had occurred a short distance from where he was in Albemarle County, Virginia. On the morning of October 16, 1959, John Brown, a radical abolitionist, and 17 white men and five African Americans attacked the government armory and railroad bridge at Harpers Ferry, Virginia.  They hoped that they would not only raise a slave revolt, but also provide their black followers arms from the arsenal in order to escape safely.  Even though Brown and his group were able to quickly take possession of the armory, they were unable to create the army of slaves that they had anticipated and had truly hoped for. ","    This raid obviously created great concern with the citizens of Charlottesville, Virginia because as Healy says in his letter, they felt as if they did not fulfill their job of protecting nearby Virginia citizens.  If they had had a sufficient military force, they could have aided Robert E. Lee's troops and ceased the attack more quickly.  Therefore, only five days after John Brown was found guilty of murder and treason, the people of Charlottesville scheduled a mass meeting in order to increase their military force.   Healy and many other students found it necessary to attend the meeting. This meeting, however, still seemed to be a very drastic measure compared to reactions across the South.  As Reynolds says, people in other states, at first, simply decided to always be armed individually in case of another abolitionist attack.  It was necessary for Virginians to take more immediate precautions because of the actions of Virginia's governor Henry Wise.  He was the one to quickly arraign Brown on three charges: murder, inciting slaves to rebellion, and treason against the state of Virginia.  Wise wanted to make a statement, and by claiming John Brown for the state of Virginia, he did.  So, in turn, Albemarle County responded quickly and efficiently to the Harpers Ferry events and stood up for the state of Virginia. ","    If John Brown had been killed during the raid, Albemarle County and other Southern counties would have taken these previously stated precautions less seriously, but this was not the case.  John Brown had a period of seven weeks between his being found guilty and his execution.  During this period, he was able to talk and write from jail; so, by the time of his death the entire nation knew of his writings.  He was no longer simply a criminal, but a martyr in the North, and a representative of the abolitionist reform to the South.  The South was then paranoid and in a state of panic.  Their views of secessionism and defense of slavery strengthened.  They were more rigid when dealing with their slaves, and all Southern states realized they should be prepared, like Virginia, with sufficient force in case of another foolish abolitionist raid.  Today, historians see John Brown in many cases as the man who truly provoked the first events that would in turn lead to the Civil War.

Stuart, on the other hand, was born in nearby Staunton where he was greatly involved with politics.   Although both of these men were politicians, they also owned land that they farmed.  In his letter to Stuart, Letcher seemed very concerned that Stuart had received some particular seeds for his farm.  These seeds were more than likely either wheat or corn because these two crops were the most popular in the Shenandoah Valley.  Also, Letcher showed much interest in making sure the seeds pleased Stuart.","This letter proves how much agriculture was important to the South.  Even though the two men were politicians, they depended on agriculture to supply food for their families as well as wealth to further their political careers.  Farming provided economic and social well-being for many other families in the South.  Without farms many people would not have been able to survive.  Particularly in western Virginia, much of the most fertile land was depleted, so many families resorted to subsistence farming.  They also tried to grow enough crops to profit from their hard labor.  The Stuart family was definitely one of these families who practiced both for-profit and subsistence farming.  The great concern for the delivery of the seeds demonstrates how these seeds were important.  The Stuart family needed these seeds to continue the preservation of their family.  They needed the seeds for food and to sell their crops on the market.

Letcher hailed from Rockbridge County where agriculture played a similar role as it did in Augusta.

His work with the Freedman's Bureau led him to buy a farm in Manassas, Virginia so he could be nearer to his offices in Louisa, Albemarle, and Orange Counties. He worked often to secure the individual rights of freedmen that many white southerners worked to undermine. Not only did white Southerners try to oppress the freedmen but the orders of the U.S. Army to their soldiers were often oppressive as well. While working in the Louisa County courthouse, Hopkins noted in his array of cases laid before him on January 13, 1868 that the \"freedmen are being outraged and swindled to about the extent that such an ignorant stupid and yielding subservient class would be anywhere else.\"","    The South under Union military rule was almost as hard as life in slavery for the freedmen. The Union soldiers were ordered to arrest \"vagrant\" black men in the cities and to remove them to the countryside to work on plantations, assuming they were too \"lazy\" to work in the cities. Historian Eric Foner notes that General Weitzel, the U.S. Army commander at Richmond, had \"ordered that before receiving assistance, whites take an oath of loyalty and blacks sign labor contracts,\" forcing the freedmen into essentially a less glorified version of slavery for the sake of the South's economy. The soldiers carried out the harsh orders of the U.S. Army lest they face the consequences of desertion: death. The sentiments of individual soldiers did not always mirror the unjust commands nor advocate a uniformly racist view towards the freedmen.","    Hopkins recorded in his diary one example of individual soldiers' ethics differing from the ethics of the entire U.S. Army. On January 13, Hopkins retired from the courthouse to his hotel room where his good friend, Mr. Butler, came to visit him. Butler proceeded to recount a deed of heroism committed at the hands of a sailor from the U.S. Navy, one Thomas M. Toombs.

The Quakers completed this petition during their annual meeting in November of 1838.  The petition stated, \"we entreat you to legislate for the termination of slavery in this state.\" Nathan Mendenhall signed the petition, and Senator J. T. Morehead from Guilford County, North Carolina presented the petition to the Senate. The Senate received the petition a few days before its adjournment.  The Western Carolinian Newspaper reported the petition to the general public on January 17, 1839.  The journalist from the Western Carolinian did not write positively about the abolition attempt, and was shocked that the movement was happening \"at home.\" ","    A petition to Congress about slavery was very common at this time.  Congress was force to issue a gag rule to end the constant debate about anti-slavery petitions.  The major issue however, was that the Quakers pushed this petition from a very prominent slave owning state. Quakers were very vocal about their religious beliefs against slavery, which sometimes got them into a lot of trouble. The Quakers strongly upheld the idea that all men are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers also felt the need to obey the law and be moral citizens.  However, these two conflicting beliefs did not stop the Quakers' fight. Many Quakers, such as Nathan Mendenhall, were active in the manumission society.  This was a society that Mendenhall and his fellow Quakers created in attempt to set up new areas in Liberia for freed slaves to live.  Other Quakers owned \"freed slaves\" to keep them from being resold into slavery, worked directly with the Underground Railroad, and were active in court cases dealing with possession of slaves. Due to this obvious protest of slavery, Quakers faced many conflicts with their slave-owning neighbors.    Quakers received harsh treatment and persecution for their actions as well.  These problems caused many Quakers to flee to the new frontier.  The majority of the Quaker population ignored their neighbors' resistance and continued to fight slavery from within North Carolina.  Although the North Carolina Quakers were a peaceful and moral religious group, they still played an important role in the abolition movement from their location in a slave holding state.

Floyd of Newberry District, South Carolina owned Ephraim and, in September 1862, sent him to the coast of South Carolina to assist with work on Confederate fortifications at the request of the Governor of South Carolina.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

Mercer kept a concise diary of daily activities. His diary consists of the condition of agriculture, weather, and his social life. Mercer was an ordinary Maryland yeoman farmer. As a yeoman farmer he relied on family and never mentioned the use of slave labor, except that of hired servants. He grew Maryland's first staple crop of tobacco as well as wheat. Wheat soon become more of a demand and his varied crops brought him greater wealth. Controlling a modest amount of land, as with most yeoman farmers, Mercer showed how non-slaveholding farmers lived their lives. Most people in the South were not massive plantation owners, but yeoman like Mercer. His daily life tells historians a lot about the ordinary men of the South.","Most of his days were spent planting and tending to his tobacco crop, which was labor-intensive, but Mercer also planted and harvested wheat.  Before the harvest of his wheat crop he would solicit the help of a hired \"servant.\" On June 27, 1857, he hired a servant man Jacob, from Miss Town, for eight dollars per month. A few days later he completed his wheat harvest of 336 pounds, which sold for 72 dollars. As historian Barbara Fields states, \"wheat required maximum work force at harvest,\" so Mercer most likely hired the free man Jacob to help harvest the wheat crop. He also hired other men during the year to help in tobacco cultivation.","Mercer's greatest enemy was the weather coupled with the \"eat worm,\" as he called it. The tobacco worm, which could eat a large plant in several hours, plagued the farmer. He wrote on June 18, 1857, that the \"eat worm destroyed many tobacco plants.\" Besides the eat worm, Mercer was at the weather's mercy. He began every entry stating the condition of the weather.  Since he was economically dependent upon the success of his crops the weather played a major part in his life. Exceptionally nasty storms were accounted for in greater detail than the average \"clean\" day.","Mercer did not spend all his days working hard in his fields; he had a social life as well. Along with his wife, Mercer would frequently visit Washington D.C. several times a month for fun and family affairs. While away, servants tended to the crops. Even though he left the work to his servants, Mercer was not a harsh or cruel man. His workers received \"holidays\" after harvest seasons and no one worked on Sundays. Thomas Mercer did not have an exceptionally interesting life, but he managed his farm and family well and never complained.

Anderson, a prominent creditor in central Virginia, found himself in the midst of a particularly difficult legal battle involving the sale and distribution of coal-rich lands in West Virginia.  The lands in question were the John Lykens and Crescent tracts.  Apparently, two men, James G. Paxton and J.R. Jordan, owned some of the land and allotted it to certain family members after they died.  However, the Kanawha-Gauley Coal and Coke Company did not know this when they decided to invest in some of the land because it contained \"very fine...coal\" and \"a fine seem of black-band ore.\"  Unfortunately for the company, some of their land overlapped with the land that Paxton and Jordan allocated out in their wills to their respective relatives.  The beneficiaries of Paxton's and Jordan's wills and the coal company all bombarded Anderson with letters asking him for a quick and fair end to the trial.  He knew that it would be impossible to satisfy everyone.  After all, there were just too many parties of interest and not enough land.  Anderson was especially worried about the backlash from the coal company if they did not get their desired share of the land.  One letter in particular contained threat upon threat.  Anderson knew that the coal company would not back down until they obtained their land.  Why could they not find other land in West Virginia?  What was so special about these tracts? ","    Around the 1880s, coal became popular in West Virginia.  It would develop into the key export in the early 1890s for three reasons.  One was the introduction and expansion of railroads, most notably the Chesapeake and Ohio railways.  The second reason was the change in preference for southern coal over northern coal, as southern coal was of higher quality than northern coal.  Thus, northern industries started to request southern coal to power their northern factories.  Lastly, when the depression of the 1890s lifted, coal output skyrocketed as larger coal companies infiltrated the area and started new enterprises.  Along with the increase in profits came the increase in population.  In McDowell County, which held the state's richest coal mines, the population rose by 600 percent from 1880-1900.  West   Virginia's prosperous coal mines lured workers and their families, as well as single white men and a large number of free black men who wanted to create a better life for themselves after emancipation.  As the mines drew in more people, production continued to escalate, demand grew, and coal became the catalyst for the economic boom in West Virginia of the late 1800s.  ","    On a larger scale, West Virginia developed into a leader of the industrial revolution that took over the South beginning in 1880.  As agricultural production stopped making large profits, the South realized it needed to revamp its economy if it wanted to compete with the North.  Slowly but surely, industry grew in the South.  Lumber and steel mills started to spring up.  Planters began abandoning their cotton fields in exchange for a position in the numerous and flourishing textile mills scattered throughout the South.  Slowly, the cities of the South started to resemble some of their urban counterparts of the North.  These industries, with coal acting as one of the leaders, destroyed the notion that the South was just one big plantation and successfully transformed the economy into one that could effectively challenge the North domestically and internationally.

Carr had just returned from nursing her cousin, Maria, who was sick with a fever. The threats of illness and death were prominent in her words.  At this time, the term \"fever\" was used to describe almost every kind of dangerous ailment.  Contemporary physicians believe that most southerners who were sick with \"the fever\" were victims of Malaria.  Carr told of Maria's feeble condition, noting, \"I had been nursing cousin Maria Carr who is recovering slowly, but so slowly that we rather hope than perceive the change from a tedious and dangerous fever and reduced to such hopelessness.\"  Most southern families, including the Carrs, did not use nurses.  Family members, especially the women, became the caregivers for the sick.  This often caused diseases to spread throughout the family, as the concept of germs was not understood in the 1820s."," The availability of legitimate doctors in the South was scarce.  According to historian Steven Stowe, the nineteenth-century medical profession was highly unregulated; many alternative healers disguised themselves as medical doctors. This, accompanied with the lack of available medications, made recovery from even a simple fever dangerous. Though no one in Carr's immediate family had recently died, she described that many of her friends felt the fatal effects of illness.  A close friend, Ms. Martha Minor, lost her six-year-old son. In her letter, Carr described the torturous emotions of losing friends: \"I maybe have been tedious in dwelling upon the scenes of sickness and death which have engulfed my time and thoughts for some weeks past, and which are not easily obliterated.\"  Carr embodied the emotion of all southern people in the 1820s.

Of all the slave rebellions in the United   States, this revolt led by Nat Turner was perhaps the most infamous. Turner's violent rebellion capitalized on one of the plantation class's greatest fears: insurrection. Campbell, in his letter to Colonel Baldwin, detailed the revolt's aftermath, noting \"the whites murdered amounted to fifty-eight\" and that \"excitement and apprehension\" had consumed Virginia. Over the course of two days, approximately seventy slaves, including \"eleven of Richard Drummond's Negroes,\" terrorized the white citizens of Southampton County. In order to comprehend the significance of the Southampton slave insurrection, it is necessary to first understand the brooding concerns of the Southern planter class.","A slave rebellion, argues historian Marion Kilson, \"expresses the realization of the worst fears of the slavocracy.\" Due to plantations' significant dependence on slave labor, an Eastern Virginian county comprised of a larger slave than white population was not atypical. The Historical Census Browser shows that according to 1830 census figures, the population of Southampton County contained 7,756 slaves and 6,573 whites. Because slaves were regarded by the white minority as a form of chattel property that could be bought and sold, potential for uprising was-ever present. Whenever violent rebellion did emerge, Southern sentiment punished the entire slave population in hopes of re-establishing confidence in the traditional plantation economy.","As a direct result of the Southampton slave insurrection, the Virginia General Assembly instituted strict legislation further assuring white social control over free and enslaved blacks. Historian Scot French writes that the Assembly \"banned blacks from preaching or attending unsupervised religious gatherings,\" while Harvey Wish notes that the Assembly strengthened the \"police codes of the slave state[s].\" Wish further observes the fact that because Nat Turner was an educated black, \"Negro education became more than ever an object of suspicion.\" Panic regarding future conspiracies encouraged trials and convictions of many slaves for alleged plots that never materialized. As William Campbell observed, \"in the present state of excitement, a little [suspicion]... on our side goes a long way.\""],"locations":[{"id":14281,"lat":36.7198931687,"lng":-77.1037749414,"zoom":9,"place":"SOUTHAMPTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":3900,"title":"Southern Wartime Humor Concerning President Lincoln\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-07","end_date":"1863-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1863 the Raleigh Register published a song by Smith Webb mocking President Lincoln and his ability to keep the Union together.

At first, the task was deemed as impossible because of insufficient funds, so the school boards declined to aid them.  At a meeting two weeks later, the boards did not consider the citizens' pleas again for a new high school and adjourned the meeting quickly.  It was not until October 5, 1891 that the boards finally decided to take pity on the citizens, agreeing to give some of the limited funds to establish the school.  It was decided that another surrounding district would give 50 per year, and Roanoke, Madison, and Walton would furnish the school building and jointly contribute 80 per month, for seven months, to pay teachers.  The Boards also assigned committees to attempt to collect extra funds from county members.   For the next few months, there seemed to be only minor difficulties in establishing the school, but in February of 1892, it was brought to the attention of the boards that this process was not going smoothly.  The principal stated, \"it was not possible to make satisfactory progress in the school without additional teachers and more desks and supplies.\"  The school still needed a great deal of funds, and the board was only able to give them a small amount.  Again, in late July, the principal appeared in front of the boards asking for even more money.  However, the board said they did not have enough funds from the state government to give the high school.  Smithville High School would have to work with what they had.  It was not until a full year later that Madison, Roanoke, and Walton County School Boards were able to increase the funding for the school.  Therefore, for a great deal of time, poor white children were incapable of receiving a proper education.  ","    Smithville, Virginia was a perfect representation of the attempt for free education in the South in the late nineteenth century.  Unlike the North, the South had never had a system of free \"common\" schools.  All education was for wealthy white children with private and expensive tutors, or some form of private religious institution.  While the North began creating this public school system in the 1830s, the South did not start until after the Civil War.  However, the true beginnings of education expansion in the South only took root in the late nineteenth century, especially in the 1890s.  While the then stable state governments took control of all financial aspects of public education, there were still only special accounts with limited funds and strict restrictions on how the money could be spent.  Therefore, it was these special accounts that hindered Madison, Roanoke, and Walton County School Boards and other counties throughout the South to give sufficient money in order to create efficient and productive high schools.  Unfortunately, it took a few decades for public schools in the South to nearly match the high standard of education in the public schools of the North.  To this day, northern public school education tends to exceed that of the South.

The previous morning, railroad workers had started running the engines of the cars before it had begun to snow, yet the tracks were already frozen with a \"sheet of hard frozen sleet.\"  This situation would normally have caused a huge problem even in Richmond and Norfolk; however, because of recent improvements in the railway system and the car's standard motor and double gearing, however, the problem did not exist in Lynchburg.  The first car was easily able to move at a quick speed and remove all impediments on the track.  Not only did it clear the path successfully, but also made it possible for other trains to run safely for the entire day.  The article stated that the system had not only been improving drastically for the past two months, but also that shortly all the cars would be equipped with the double gearing, making the Lynchburg and western Virginia railway system would be \"second to none.\"","    The reason for this strong success in the railroad system was because of the recent purchase of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company by the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies.  While the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies took indirect control of the Shenandoah Valley Company in 1883, improvements were slow, and because of bad tracks and still uneven tracks, profits hit an all-time low.  Money intake increased, and this final purchase in1890 was the key to success.   The new owners had a strict development policy and were attempting to improve the lines for the general welfare of the people and the growth progress of their towns.  This new and improved system meant a safe and successful route from Washington D.C. to Tennessee, encompassing many important counties in western Virginia.  Consequently, the Lynchburg newspaper had articles like the previous one as well as many comments made by citizens of the town in the \"Items of Interest\" section about their excitement for easy and safe travel as well as future growth of industrialization in their counties.  More specifically, almost every day The Daily Virginian reported the increasing profits of the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies.  The people were proud of both the improvement of the railroad system and the growing development of their western proportion of Virginia, and were excited to talk about it frequently in their newspaper. ","    These same developments were occurring all throughout the South in the early 1890s as well.  While railroads had been prevalent for many decades, they were never completely safe and successful.  Because of the multitude of railroad companies, tracks were uneven, times were uncoordinated, and wrecks were frequent.  However, the post-Reconstruction period brought a time when the railroads could improve not only in large cities, but also in the less populated counties throughout the southern states.  In Lynchburg and surrounding counties, the Norfolk and Western Railroad companies attempted and later succeeded in doing this exact thing. Essentially, the railroad made it possible for Lynchburg and other small towns in western Virginia to further industrialize and grow in many ways that they were incapable of doing before.

Their choice for president was Millard Fillmore of New York, and for vice president Andrew U. Donelson of Tennessee, nominated by the American Party.  There was no further explanation for this information, but rather an announcement the editors believed to be true for the majority of Abingdon citizens.  A letter by Abingdon resident F. McMullin approved in the May 17, 1856 issue of the newspaper, saying that he had been \"requested by Mr. M. H. Buchannan, sheriff to this county, to state that the same commissioners and conductors who superintended the elections last spring will perform that duty on Thursday next, the 22nd.\"  While Mr. McMullin was only supposed to give this particular information, he went on to write on his own political views.  He said he was aware of the county's choice to vote mostly for the newly-formed American Party, but he wished they would consider their view on the Whig Party and notice that urban areas of the state like Richmond, Norfolk, Lynchburg, and Alexandria still recorded Whig majorities. However, Washington County citizens did not seem to take this letter into consideration.  Even a week later there was still no response regarding it, and these two candidates' names were still printed in bold on the second page of the newspaper.  ","    While this sort of announcement and letter were very prevalent in Virginia newspapers throughout the decade because of Virginians' obsession with politics, there was normally some form of opposition from a citizen within the county. It is ironic that there was no response to this letter, especially since according to historian William Link, only 35 percent of Valley and Southwest Virginia citizens voted for Millard Fillmore in the 1856 election.  In these regions where Abingdon is located, around 90 percent of the citizens voted Democratic and would not only be opposed to Fillmore, but also McMullin's idea for the continuation of Whig approval.  It was unlikely that citizens had nothing to say about the political matter because these issues were the subject of discussion not only in this county in Virginia, but all counties throughout the South.  The Whig Party was dwindling from its previous excellence, the Democratic Party was growing strong, and parties such as the Know-Nothings and American Party were gaining support, yet no one was completely aware of who was to follow.  The main topic of debate was slavery, and by the time of the election of 1856 it was unclear which party would be the most successful in maintaining the South's way of life.  Therefore, it is most likely that a citizen in Abingdon did respond to McMullin's letter, just not immediately as historians would suspect.

At that convention James Shannon gave an address entitled \"Domestic Slavery,\" in which he attempted to justify the practice of slavery and disprove the validity of the reasons given by abolitionists to outlaw the practice. The reasons he gave in support of slavery covered a broad spectrum, typical of the Southern justification of slavery. He cited Bible verses that in his mind showed that slavery was condoned, even encouraged, by God himself. He predicted economic catastrophe in not only the southern United   States, but the entire country, if the slaves received freedom. Shannon estimated the value of slaves in the United States at over two billion dollars, a huge financial loss in the event of emancipation. He attempted to refute claims about the immorality of slavery by arguing that the slaves actually benefited from American slavery, saying that under the guidance of the white race the Africans learned how to be civilized. In his conclusion he suggested that once \"all peaceable means to protect our rights, and save the Union\" were exhausted, \"we will stand to arms,\" and \"God will defend the right.\"","            Shannon's arguments for slavery were typical of the rhetoric used by pro-slavery forces in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Southerners believed that they were justified by the law and by God in their practice of slavery, but Shannon's remarks went beyond simply justifying the practice of slavery. Even in 1855, half a decade before the first state seceded from the Union, the idea of secession from the Union was common among Southern pro-slavery forces. The aggressiveness of the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed outlawing slavery in all the land acquired during the Mexican-American War, caught the attention of Southerners. Shannon was among many others who thought that preemptive action was necessary to stop Northern politicians from outlawing slavery. This early support by Southerners for secession and acceptance of violence as a necessary step in order to protect the right to slavery made the American Civil War seem inevitable, even five years before the first shot was fired."],"locations":[{"id":7668,"lat":39.0656247172,"lng":-93.7855117112,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":3913,"title":"Disaster on the Carolina Railroad\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-01","end_date":"1856-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On May 19, 1856, C.M. Siller wrote a letter to his friend J.L. Twyman, a resident of Buchanan County, Virginia. From his room at the Washington Hotel in Lynchburg, Virginia, Siller described the details of his train ride to Anderson, South Carolina two weeks earlier. His three-page letter discussed in great depth the landscape of the various towns he saw, as well as the agricultural production of each farm he saw. Evidently, the type of soil – whether it was healthy red clay or nasty swampland – was very important to him and his letter's recipient since nearly half of the letter was a commentary on the fertility of the land. Siller additionally described the crops grown in each area, a reflection of his obvious interest in farming. Despite the fact that Twyman was a doctor and Siller presumably a businessman, this interest in agriculture was not uncommon at the time. ","Siller's account of the route his train took comprised a significant part of the letter.  He went into great detail to describe the fares – ranging from three dollars to six fifty per leg – as well as the length of the journey in miles and hours.  His account of the train ride was extensive in part due to the considerable number of stops and connections that the voyage to South Carolina from Virginia required.  Siller described many different towns along the route and mentioned constantly getting on and off the train to have a meal or take a break. At one point during his journey, he was required to descend the train and meet at a steamboat, where the boat took him to switch railroad services. ","The last portion of his letter to Twyman was a description of an accident on the train before the passengers reached Anderson. A piece of iron from the train track broke from the worn out trestles and caused the passenger car to flip and fall into a sand bank. The injuries Siller sustained were worse than most passengers' because his seat was in the front of the train; while most travelers left without a scrape, Siller dislocated his left shoulder and broke his arm. Although he was thankful that his life was spared, Siller was aggrieved by his eventful journey; his letter mentioned that his injuries caused him great discomfort and he was unable to sleep at night. ","Siller's letter to Twyman illustrated that transportation through the antebellum South by train was neither an effortless nor an enjoyable undertaking.  The South did not have a well-organized rail system that allowed for people and products to be moved around the region effectively. According to John Majewski, author of A House Dividing, \"Southern railroads took weeks to transport supplies and raw materials between eastern and western theaters.\" From Siller's emphasis on the agricultural rather than technological aspects of the train voyage in his letter, he demonstrated how much the South relied on agriculture. To a Southerner, farming was the main source of revenue and was considered the single most important aspect of life; technological development did not seem entirely necessary in the mid-nineteenth century. However, Majewski notes that \"a bountiful harvest counted for little if local railroad tracks were destroyed by foes… or if wagons… were impressed to serve the army\". The issue became a major setback for the Confederacy during the Civil War when the South's obsolete railroads created a severe disadvantage against the North's highly industrialized system.

While this editorial in the New Year's Eve edition of the <em>Times </em>was brief, it nevertheless emphasized that blacks were still a threat to society, especially under the administration of Republican President Benjamin Harrison.  Moreover, the editorial highlighted growing white backlash in Virginia against the rights that African Americans gained following the Civil War. ","            Numerous reasons explain why the editor of the <em>Times</em> criticized Harrison's administration and the situation of black Americans.  Harrison took office in 1888 having defeated Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat.  Running on a platform of \"Rejuvenated Republicanism,\" Harrison received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Cleveland, and he alienated strongly Democratic areas of the country as he took office in 1889.  Additionally, his support for black civil rights and his appointment of Frederick Douglass as a foreign minister to Haiti further angered his opposition.  Cleveland, on the other hand, had supported returning captured Confederate flags to former Confederate states and had expressed federal appreciation of Confederate soldiers.  Harrison's failure to engender support from Democrats and former Confederates resulted in the 1892 re-election of Cleveland in the most decisive presidential election in 20 years.","            The advancement of civil rights legislation that followed the Civil War was a source of opposition to black citizens.  Historians Nancy Bentlen and Sandra Gunning write that after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, \"African American men were suddenly free to enter local and national government during Reconstruction.\"  Philip A. Bruce's publication of <em>The Plantation Negro as a Freeman</em> in 1889 reflected growing white opposition to black freedom.  Characterizing black men as immoral and rebellious, Bruce \"devoted a great deal of time to writing Southern history that directly aided and abetted the post-Reconstruction backlash against African Americans, arguing that as they moved beyond slavery, blacks were inevitably devolving into barbarism.\"  ","            Both the administration of Harrison and the advancement of black rights that took place after the Civil War and Reconstruction gave rise to this editorial.  Its criticisms and fears reflected those of white Virginians across the state, many of whom were staunchly Democratic and still loyal to the former Confederacy.  That this editorial appeared on New Year's Eve also illuminates the primacy of race as a political issue at the end of the nineteenth century.

The writer specifically listed three men who he believed were adequate candidates: P.P. Barbour, William C. Rives, and P.V. Daniel.  These men were acceptable because, the writer avowed, their \"political preferences are well known.\"","            Although Tyler identified himself as a Democrat at the time of this letter, he opposed many of Jackson's policies and antagonized members of Jackson's administration.  Additionally, he was the only Democrat in the Senate to oppose an act allowing the federal government to ignore South Carolina's policy of nullification.  In January 1833, Virginia's legislature resolved not to sanction nullification, further opposing Tyler's personal belief in states' rights.  This belief eventually overrode Tyler's commitment to Jackson and the Democratic Party.  In 1836, Tyler resigned from the Senate after the Virginia General Assembly ordered him to support Jackson's policies regarding the Bank of the United States.","              This letter to the <em>Enquirer</em> therefore reflected the Virginia legislature's opinion that Tyler's views ran counter to Virginia's overall political platform.

Jackson appointed Barbour as a circuit court judge in Virginia in 1830, and Barbour subsequently became a Jacksonian whom Tyler opposed.

McDonald affirmed his solemn belief that \"the best interests of Virginia are involved in this proposed visit, and it may be the country, too.\"  Not surprisingly, McDonald was the editor of a Democratic journal in Lynchburg, Virginia.  He conveyed his deep desire to have President Cleveland attend the Lynchburg Fair in October in order to rescue Virginia from falling into the hands of the Mahoneites and out of the hands of the Democrats.  McDonald continued on in his letter to list the various means by which the President could arrive in Lynchburg and depart in a timely manner.  He even stated that he could easily extend the date of the Fair so as to accommodate Cleveland's schedule.  He signed his letter, \"your friend and obedient servant.\"","            McDonald's request came during the decline of Virginia's Readjuster Movement, led by William Mahone.  The movement aimed to lower state debt by enacting liberal reforms, including broadening education opportunities for black citizens.  Gaining the nickname \"the party of the Negro,\" the Readjuster Movement won a degree of support in the early 1880s for its financial policies.  Additionally, Mahone sought alliances with Republican officeholders in order to gain more political salience.  Pleas like that of McDonald arose, therefore, out of Democrats' fear of Republican and Readjuster control of state-and even national-politics.  The Readjuster political platform opposed Conservatism, which in Virginia \"was not only a political party, it was also a social code and a state of mind which bound the whites to united and temperate action,\" according to author Charles Chilton Pearson.","            Although Mahoneism and the Readjuster Movement were on the decline when McDonald wrote his letter, they still threatened the Conservative ideals of the Democratic Party.  They also threatened to upset the tenuous racial balance in the state.  In the 1883 Danville Riot, a street fight broke out between blacks and whites over a school board issue.  In Lynchburg, former Confederate General Jubal Early avowed, \"the Negroes must know that they are to behave themselves and keep in their proper places.\"  McDonald believed that staunchly Democratic Cleveland was an effective counterbalance to the Readjuster movement, and he therefore attempted to feature him as the central figure in Lynchburg's 1887 Fair."],"locations":[{"id":13702,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}]},{"id":3919,"title":"Hope of Release\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-30","end_date":"1865-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Ashby Family was originally from Fauquier County, Virginia.

It was more frequent towards the end, and the case of desertion from General Logan's unit was no exception. A number of factors contributed to widespread desertion from the battlefields, particularly the sense of conflicting duties that many men faced. Soldiers felt a duty to the Confederacy but also a strong obligation to protect their homes and families. According to historian Mark Weitz, they experienced a \"push from the conditions they were in\" and a \"pull which came from home.\" Furthermore, unpopular practices such as conscription often undermined their sense of patriotism and the national identity that the Confederate government had tried to build. Conditions on the battlefield also drove soldiers to desert. Many suffered emotional and physical hardships from the horrible realities of war and the intense demands placed upon them on a daily basis. Troop morale was critical to their performance and also for the drive to remain loyal to the Southern cause. The scarcity of necessary supplies such as food and clothing, especially as the war progressed, also contributed to desertion.","Punishment for deserters varied. Some commanders such as Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg stressed the importance of severe punishment-often a death sentence-to those who fled the army. They felt that the prospect of death served as a deterrent for the crime.

In his diary, Stokes highlighted the major events throughout his three-year term of enlistment in the Civil War. Specifically, he noted a number of occasions in which his regiment came in contact with both African American soldiers in the Union Army and slaves. In one such episode, Stokes learned that a small group of enemy soldiers, including eight armed blacks, had been tapping their telegraph wires near Green Pond, South Carolina. Stokes and his men soon pursued the party and managed to capture three of the black spies. Although he added that one of the black scouts drowned in retreat, Stokes provided no further information on the incident. ","The use of African Americans as spies was common throughout the Civil War. African Americans comprised over nine percent of the Union war force by the end of the war, but only a small fraction served as combat soldiers in the field. This was a result of a number of different factors, including a lack of experience, preparation, and training; poor organization; and carelessness on the part of white officers. Due to the racial divide, black troops also experienced unfair treatment for much of the war. Although few blacks directly participated on the battlefield, the Union Army employed many behind the scenes as scouts, raiders, or spies. They provided a significant contribution to the war effort. William Stokes encountered one such reconnaissance team, as he noted in his journal. The use of African Americans in the war, although not always on the front, gave the Union Army a distinct advantage and proved to be a \"defining moment in the history of the [black] race.\""],"locations":[{"id":11488,"lat":32.467984914,"lng":-80.4033249144,"zoom":8,"place":"COLLETON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":3926,"title":"Religion on the Battlefield\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-09-16","end_date":"1861-09-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    In an unsigned letter dated September 16, 1861, a Confederate soldier wrote to his family to tell of his first few weeks marching to war. His letter began with mundane details of the dates and names of towns his regiment marched through and speculations of when and where he would meet the enemy, but most of the letter is filled with religious tones and rhetoric. ","    The anonymous Confederate soldier wrote home that \"[if] it should be the Lord's will that I should fall on the battlefield, it will all be right. [...] the great end of this life is to prepare for death, and an entrance upon another.\" Of those who followed Christian beliefs, historian Steven E. Woodworth writes that their faith \"encompassed many facets of life, and they also believed that this present life was not the conclusion of their existence.\" This most certainly gave soldiers a sense of relief and peace, know matter what experiences they may have to endure on Earth. The Confederate and Union soldiers not only had a high chance of dying on the battlefield but also that it would be a very gruesome or lingering death, especially when the main method of healing a musket wound was by amputation. But the soldier from Nansemond County found that not all men outwardly practiced their beliefs. He witnessed that the circumstances of \"camplife are any thing else but favorable to religion, or deeptoned piety. Here I see and here [sic] more wickedness in one week than all that I ever met before put together.\" ","    In his letter the soldier reasoned with his family and urged them not to worry, arguing \"this world is not my home, and we should never shudder, or grieve at the escape of those we love, from a dreary desert, to a pleasant home.\" Of those who were Christian, Woodworth asserts that many soldiers \"spoke feelingly of heaven as home.\" This brought comfort not only to the soldiers but also to their loved ones or survivors left behind and out of the danger of war. ","    At the tail end of the soldier's letter he firmly advised his family to follow the word of God. \"Make the service of God the great object of your life, and He will make your salvation the great care of His heart.\" Woodworth states that many citizens and soldiers alike viewed \"heaven as a place of happy meeting.\" This view comforted both those close to death and those left alive. Soldiers and civilians both had the reassurance that death was not the end but only the beginning of life. The soldier not only wanted to ensure his own seat in heaven but those of his family as well so he could die peacefully with the knowledge that he would see them again.

To use the words of her editors, the Gazette continued printing \" at a cost and trouble of which many of our readers have not the least conception; for if they had, there would not be so many who would still withhold what they owe us for our labor.\" ","    The war cost the Confederacy a great deal of resources, making simple and everyday items and foodstuffs scarce. The South sent its young men off to fight the North, which meant that they also sent off a majority of their farmers to go fight. Conscription was strict and only a small demographic of men were exempt from service. The Confederacy exempted only those planters owning twenty or more slaves and those that grew food crops only. Planters and the Confederacy could not waste land on cotton. The women and young sons of these soldier-farmers had a hard time bringing in the harvest without the extra labor of fathers and older brothers or sons, so food was scarce. The slaves also found it easier to resist their mistresses or run away with their masters and overseers away at war. Even a number of slaves were drawn away from the fields to fight alongside or serve the Confederate Army. Historian William Blair writes \"large-scale farmers on whom the burden of production now rested felt besieged by their own people, as nonproducers and the poor clamored for regulated prices on foodstuffs and the Confederacy demanded slaves for production and military work.\" The Richmond Bread Riot in 1863, when 68 women were arrested in the Richmond market after causing a ruckus and breaking into shops to steal bread, illustrated these tensions.","    Not only could the Confederacy not produce enough food, but the Union Army also destroyed what little they had when marching through Southern towns. Blair writes of the destruction the Union Army doled out within \"a five-mile radius around Dayton\" in the Shenandoah Valley. Blair states that the Union Army burned and killed \"a total of 2,000 barns filled with wheat, hay, and implements; seventy mills filled with grain; and roughly 4,000 head of livestock.\" This lack of supplies, coupled with the Confederacy continuously printing its own unbacked paper money and raising the inflation rate, effectively crippled the South's economy. Thus when the Gazette asked for repayment, it offered a variety of methods to pay off amassed debts: \"we will take from those in arrears, 1 in specie, 1 bushel of wheat, 1 1/8 bushels of corn, 7 pounds of good bacon or butter, 75 pounds of clean rags, or a half load of wood for each year as may best suit subscribers.\""],"locations":[{"id":14234,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":3930,"title":"Student Withdraws After Beating Slave Girl\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-03","end_date":"1856-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            In May 1856, students and faculty at the University of Virginia were consumed by the news that the faculty board forced a student to withdraw after beating a slave child.  The removal of a student from the Academical  Village over a slave whipping was difficult for many to believe since whipping was a common disciplinary action for misbehaving servants.  Confusion mixed with curiosity lingered throughout the grounds.  ","            In late April 1856, W.D. Clarke, a student at the University of Virginia became particularly agitated after seeing a young slave girl chase a flock of pigeons onto the grounds of the University of Virginia.  After chastising and threatening the girl with a whipping, Clarke approached the slave's master to inform him of the child's misconduct, expecting prompt disciplinary action.  To his astonishment, the master chose to disregard the girl's actions and Clarke's anger, telling Clarke to leave the young slave alone and go about his day.  ","            Clarke's anger continued to build until he decided to take matters into his own hands late one evening.  Clarke beckoned the young slave girl to his living quarters and proceeded to discipline the girl himself, beating her until she became unconscious and  bringing her within inches of death.       Clarke's violent behavior angered the University of Virginia community.  Many felt that his actions negatively represented the community of scholars and that his actions should be evaluated by the faculty, a common practice at the University for any dishonorable act.  Clarke went before the faculty board, who reviewed his actions.  On May 3, 1856, the faculty board voted that Clarke's actions were inexcusable, requiring him to withdraw immediately from the University.  ","            Almost one full day later, Clarke responded to the faculty's decision in a letter requesting the board to reconsider its final verdict on his case.  Clarke acknowledged that his actions were dishonorable, however, he also wrote that he could have justified his actions with \"sufficient representation.\"  Days later, the faculty board at the University  of Virginia decided to rescind his withdrawal.  ","            The actions of W.D. Clarke and the response of the University of Virginia were particularly characteristic of the accepted social behavior of the slave South during the mid-nineteenth century.  A racially tense white society regularly scrutinized the behavior of slaves<strong>.  </strong>Masters would routinely discipline slaves who acted inappropriately.   Furthermore, it is also important to recognize the social implications that would result from disciplining a slave owned by another master during the nineteenth century.  It was considered illegal to discipline another master's slaves because slaves were the master's private property.    Clarke's defiant and violent behavior toward the young slave girl and the University's response exemplified the gravity of such actions in areas where slavery was a significant aspect of society.

The writer's real name was Reverend Julius J. Fleming, a prominent and outspoken citizen of Charleston widely respected for his roles as a preparatory school principal, a Methodist preacher, and earlier in his life, as the editor of the <em>Sumter Watchman</em>, a Charleston area newspaper. More importantly, however, the editorial Fleming penned shows a distinct knowledge of the fundamental problem that plagued Reconstruction South Carolina.","In the editorial letter that he penned in the <em>Courier</em>,<em> </em>one of dozens that he would write during his lifetime, Fleming addressed many problems that the Civil War had laid on South Carolina. In particular, Fleming's message also posed two significant queries relevant to the safety and survival of Southern culture: \"How can<em> </em>peace and quiet be permanently secured?\" and \"How and where will farmers find an adequate, reliable labor force?\" ","Interestingly enough, both of Fleming's questions hinged on one all-important aspect of Southern lifestyle, the slave labor agricultural system that had existed for nearly two hundred years at the time of the Civil War. Fleming, in his editorial, described slavery as \"the life-blood of secession and the real <em>casus belli</em> [cause of war],\" thereby showing that slavery's end was to be the single largest hardship faced during Reconstruction. On this note, he claimed that \"by one sweep the wealth of the country is taken away, and a people accustomed to wealth and ease are suddenly reduced to poverty, humiliation and toil.\" Fleming's idea of South Carolina's economic ruin as a result of emancipation was later supported by Civil War historian W. Scott Poole, who cited the disappearance of \"enormous wealth, founded as it had been on a now defunct social system.\"","There is no doubt that both questions Fleming posed were difficult ones to answer, especially considering the Union Army had freed a gigantic number of former slaves during their march through South Carolina. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the author developed several sensible answers to uncertainties faced not only in South Carolina, but the South as a whole, in his landmark editorial. Among these suggestions, Fleming's envisioned arrangement for agricultural change was particularly impressive, and featured a version of sharecropping in which wealthy planters would \"divide up a portion of their estates into small farms which emigrants can readily obtain by purchase or lease.\"  In the post-war South, Fleming's system was put to use on a large scale, and it lasted into the twentieth century. ","Across his editorial, Fleming displayed an acute knowledge of the problems to be faced as the result of slavery's demise in post-Civil War South Carolina. While there is no question that Fleming's editorial addressed on one hand \"a people picking up the pieces of an existence shattered and changed by war and defeat,\" there is also no question as to the overarching theme of his letter. This motif, of course, was not disquiet or misery, but rather an appreciation that \"the war [was] over never to be renewed.\""],"locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":3933,"title":"The Huger House Fire in Clermont, South Carolina","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-03-17","end_date":"1821-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 17, 1821, a woman named Harriet Lucas Huger penned an affectionate letter to her aunt, Mrs. Harriott Horry, thanking her for expressing concern over the family's well-being. Just days earlier, a catastrophic fire had destroyed the Huger's plantation home in Clermont, South Carolina; upon finding this out, Mrs. Horry had written a letter to her niece to ensure the Huger family's health. ","As Harriet Huger narrated in the letter to her aunt, the fire did no serious harm to the family. Although one of Harriet's daughters did suffer mildly from smoke inhalation after the blaze, the young mother's letter states plainly that \"the rest of the family [is] in good health,\" a fact that she looked upon with obvious gratitude.","Coincidentally, Harriet Huger's letter also described the family's intentions following the fire, saying that \"the greater part of our furniture was saved without much injury,\" and illustrating the family's plans for the near future. Part of a prosperous family (evidenced by the fact that Harriet, as a woman, could read and write exceptionally well), Harriet also mentioned that the family's \"two [slave] carpenters...immediately set about fitting up one of our outbuildings for our summer accommodation.\" ","With luxuries such as education and slave labor at their disposal, Harriet Huger and her family certainly belonged to South Carolina's planter class. In fact, according to South   Carolina historian Henry White, the affluent Huger-Pinckney family had been involved in large-scale rice planting since the first decade of the nineteenth century and owned \"among the rice fields...a spacious home.\" ","Despite their wealth, the devasting house fire <em>certainly</em> affected the Huger family. For one, the blaze destroyed an ancestral home of considerable value that had been passed down continuously over several generations. Also, as her letter clearly expresses, the burning of her house shook Harriet Huger emotionally, a fact she expresses to her aunt in the vain hope that her family \"be exempt from domestic calamity.\" Even so, Harriet and the rest of the Huger family were quite fortunate, for they rebuilt their plantation home within one year of the blaze due to the vast agricultural wealth held in the family coffers.","While the Huger family was quite privileged, both in their affluence and personal safety, the opportunities they enjoyed following their house fire were certainly not available to all Southern families. All the same, Harriet Lucas Huger's letter is quite valuable, for it not only describes a variety of problems families faced in the antebellum South, but also a vivid account of how families of the planter society handled those disasters on a day-to-day basis."],"locations":[{"id":11652,"lat":33.8522812111,"lng":-80.2797613977,"zoom":8,"place":"SUMTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}]},{"id":3934,"title":"Liberation in Liberia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-01","end_date":"1832-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to the <em>Elizabeth City Star</em>, the proposal to send free blacks to the colony of Liberia was a \"scheme entirely Utopian.\"  This North Carolina newspaper praised the American Colonization Society's ideas about how to handle the \"race problem,\" as they deemed the growing number of newly freed blacks in America.  A group of prominent Americans convened in December 1816 and established the Society.  Many liberal citizens advocated for the freedom of African Americans, yet few wanted their company as fellow citizens of the United States.  Returning the freed blacks to Africa seemed to be the perfect solution.

","The article briefly mentioned the idea that taking freed blacks away from their lives in America and sending them to Liberia, a place unfamiliar to most, may be \"a system of cruelty worse than slavery itself.\"  However, on the whole, the newspaper thought that the goals of the American Colonization Society were divinely ordained and beneficial to all.

There was not one mention of abolition throughout the North Carolina pamphlet; it solely pertained to the subject of temperance.  The Sons of Temperance drew more membership and popularity during the 1840s and 1850s, especially among white middle-class and artisan groups.  The wealthy-planter class did not become too invested in the movement partly because alcohol and \"social drinking\" were \"essential to the lives of the southern gentry.\"  The reformers involved emphasized self-discipline and self-improvement by abstaining from alcoholic beverages.

Lane was born and raised in a relatively pleasant environment (compared to other slaves) on a large plantation with over 250 slaves.  As a child, Lane played with the white children, but as he grew up, Lane said, \"I discovered the difference between myself and my master's white children.\"  While they began to read and write, Lane began to work in the fields and was not permitted to touch a book.  However, throughout most of Lunsford Lane's experience as a slave, he worked as a \"body servant and waiter in his master's fine mansion\" and did not suffer the toils of fieldwork.  In fact, he seemed to appreciate living in North Carolina because he said there was a constant fear of being sold to the Deep South, where slavery was harsher.  As soon as Lane discovered the possibility of buying one's freedom, he set to work, night and day.  He began selling peaches and marbles whenever he had the chance and eventually sold prepared smoking tobacco and pipes at fifteen and ten cents each, becoming known as a tobacconist around town.  He worked and went into town to sell his products late at night and early in the morning, living an exhausting lifestyle.  Lane eventually married, and had six children, and raised 1,000 dollars to purchase his freedom.  Lane describes the feeling once freed, \"I cannot describe it, only it seemed as though I was in heaven.\"  Soon after, he bought his entire family for 3,000 dollars.  However, Lane ran into many problems with the North Carolina court, which had many laws about free blacks living in North Carolina.

He had finally achieved a dream that he believed would change the lives of generations of young African Americans.  Yancey had overcome the obstacles of racist sentiments and segregation that were a widespread aspect of life in Albemarle County, Virginia. ","    Benjamin Franklin Yancey traveled to Albemarle  County in the early 1890s with a dream to educate African Americans.  He began fundraising projects to raise money to build a school on a former plantation in Scottsville,  Virginia.  Yancey firmly believed that a school for black youths would provide them with the skills they would need to move up in society.  However, as Yancey worked to create such a school, he faced numerous obstacles.  Particularly, the racial tensions that existed in Albemarle  County towards the end of the nineteenth century delayed Yancey's fundraising progress.  However, Yancey worked to overcome these obstacles and he eventually opened the doors to one of the first black schools in central Virginia, naming it the Esmont Colored  School.  Yancey, along with his wife, ran the school and taught young African American children basic skills such as reading and writing.  ","    During the post-emancipation years, African Americans faced great disadvantages in education.  These disparities, which began during slavery, continued into the era of Jim Crow, when black children were forbidden to attend school with white children.  \"Separate but equal\" schools were legalized in 1896 after the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson </em>ruling, however, the schools for black students rarely equaled those for white.   Blacks often faced extremely uncomfortable conditions and less than mediocre education.  In response to reports of these conditions, many educated Americans became active in the effort to educate freedmen.  Several individuals, like Benjamin Yancey, devoted the rest of their lives to the education of newly freed black Southerners.  As a result, schools for freedmen were rapidly being erected across the South.   These individuals embodied the ideals of Civil Rights activist W.E.B. DuBois, who stressed the importance of \"full educational opportunities.\"  Like DuBois, Yancey thought that the founding of the Esmont Colored School would give black Southerners the opportunity to move up in a world without slavery.

Dated December 21, 1822, the letter described some of the details of Perkins' journey, including an illness that befell one of his traveling companions, Betty: \"...all well exept bety and she has bin very sick on the road hardly expected her to liv and was very trobesom on the road with that not in her side....\"  The description of the \"not in her side\" seems to imply that Betty suffered from some kind of pain, or possibly even a bulge, on the side of her body.  Historian Thomas Wertenbaker asserts that medical knowledge in the antebellum South was rudimentary at best.  Especially in rural plantation societies like Virginia and Maryland, doctors were hard to find, and even if found they were not always likely to be consulted.  Many in the South believed that doctors did more harm than good, which is probably true considering their widespread use of such treatments as bloodletting and their lack of knowledge concerning germ theory.  In this light it is understandable why Perkins did not hold out much hope for Betty's survival.","      According to F. N. Boney, a number of Southern doctors in the antebellum period performed medical experiments on slaves.  Doctors used the prevailing belief that blacks were inferior to whites to justify the often grotesque procedures to which they subjected slaves.  They performed many experiments, including the trial of a new (and highly dangerous) vaccination procedure and even an effort to discover an effective surgical method for sealing clefts that caused bladder leakage.  Slaves endured unimaginable pain and suffering due to such atrocities, but in the doctors' minds it was all in the name of science.  Regardless of the means through which discoveries were made, medical science in the antebellum South left much to be desired.  Concepts that are considered self-evident today, such as germ theory, were unknown at the time.  Perkins described most of his traveling as such: it \"...was water Bound three times and was very mody....\"  Frequently surrounded by water and mud, his traveling party must have come into contact with an untold amount of pathogens.

In a diary entry dated October 1874, she noted, \"as teachers we should set an example worthy of imitation, (for there is a fearful responsibility resting upon us,) and there is no better way of doing it than by showing reverence for God's word and seeking his guidance.\"  Being religious herself, Gregory desired to imbue her pupils with an appreciation for having a relationship with God.  Lynn Lyerly, a historian who has studied women and religion in the South, discusses how many women in the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century South sought to engage in mission work outside of home and the church.  Numerous organizations of Protestant women sought not only to witness the Gospel to the public, but also to perform acts of kindness and charity for the less fortunate.","      According to historian Charles Wilson, Southern religion has always been heavily influenced by the Calvinists' negative attitude toward human nature.  For this reason, churches in the South tend to emphasize the need for a conversion through God's grace and a subsequent life of morality.  Wilson's assertions help explain Lyerly's description of many Southern women as motivated to evangelize and perform mission work outside their traditional spheres of influence.  Gregory seems to have been one of these women, seeing as she used her position as a teacher to spread the word of God in hopes of positively influencing the lives of her students.  In her own words, \"for the past two mornings our principal has opened the school by reading the Scriptures and prayer.  I am decidedly in favor of it-it will make a lasting impression upon the minds of the children.\"  Gregory's support of prayer and Bible-reading in school suggests a belief that children who are taught in a religious environment are likely to live more proper lives.

Walker and Susan Josephine Sampson were married in a small church in Petersburg,  Virginia.  The announcement of their marriage described the beauty and elegance of the event.  Many people were present and most of these were family and friends who lived in the nearby area.  It is interesting to note, however, that Bible verses were listed on the announcement and the marriage was recorded in the family Bible.  In addition to this particular marriage, many others were listed in the same place.  This indicated that the Walkers saw the joining of two people as a sacred event.","The thick relationship between marriages and churches was not uncommon in the South during this time.  Religion, predominantly Protestantism, had a tremendous affect on all aspects of Southern life.  These Protestant roots of the South spread throughout people's lives.  From farming to slavery to the family, religion influenced all aspects of Southern life.  Many families did not go a week without attending a church meeting, which is why the Walkers had a religious wedding ceremony.  ","These deep roots in the Protestant religion resulted from the revivals of the mid-eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century.  Revivalism reached the hearts of many Southerners, especially Virginians.  The aftermath of these revivals resulted in the Southern focus on religion.  Since religion was such a huge part of life in Virginia and in the South, many southerners, like the Walkers, held religious marriages and recorded such events in their Bibles.

The newspaper contained many other written editorials that expressed people's opinions.  The advice in this column, however, was more credible for others to read and follow because another farmer wrote the article.  As the quote suggests, every farm needed good quality tools to be efficient.  Along with good tools, good labor was the key to a productive farm.  Young, strong slaves made up this good labor force.  The article stated that in order to have a productive farm, one had to choose the best available slaves.  Owners must then treat their slaves with at least some care to keep them healthy.  A healthy labor force was an efficient one, according to the article.  Slave labor and good tools were the first steps to improving a farm's production.","This article demonstrated the importance of agriculture in Virginia and in the South at the time.  Agriculture drove the Southern economy, and it depended on a slave labor force.  In particular, there were 2,510 slaves in 1850 in Roanoke County; that number increased to 2,643 slaves in 1860.  Slaves were necessary for the Southern economy to work and function properly.  Slaves were so vital to the Southern way of life that they made up over thirty-six percent of the population of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South  Carolina, and Georgia.

These letters began a correspondence between the young author and his mentor that would last over the next few years. Simms and Stoddard were both fairly highly regarded (Simms much more than Stoddard), but the men differed greatly in backgrounds and the kind of literature they produced. Simms was a man from the South and an important member of the movement to create a distinct Southern literature that began in the years leading up to the Civil War, while Stoddard was a northerner who spent most of his life writing poetry.

This effort, however valiant, was not terribly successful. The literature these Southern authors produced was strikingly similar to that which was found in the North, but it never gained the same degree of popularity. For a short time following the Civil War, Southerners continued to attempt to distinguish themselves by writing of the fallen South, but as the war faded into history, so did the attempts of Southern authors to separate themselves.

Pinckney, a plantation owner in South Carolina, did not expect these men to continue working for free, but he realized that without them, his plantation was destined for failure. He stated simply, \"I acknowledged their freedom; did not expect them to work on the old terms, but would pay them for their labor, etc.\" Pinckney respected the knowledge of the land and agricultural work that these men had acquired while working for him, and for this reason he wished them to stay on his plantation. After his request, Pinckney received a largely negative response from these former slaves. Acknowledging their rights as free men, Pinckney told them that if they were to stay on his land they would have to work for him, but they were free to go wherever they wanted. The slaves found themselves in a frustrating bind. Fearing the failure of the federal paper currency (greenbacks), they wished to work for themselves instead of Pinckney employing them. They questioned the actions of the government, asking \"what good does it do for the government to give us our freedom and not give us land to plant?\" Pinckney, probably like most former plantation owners, was equally frustrated because his livelihood relied on the productivity of his plantation, and he could not possibly do all the work himself. ","    The free men did begin to work, but \"it was only starvation that brought them to it.\" Without any land, they could not provide food for themselves or their families, so they had to work under whatever conditions Pinckney offered. On Pinckney's plantation they were \"generally forced to adopt the share system.\" This share system became common throughout the South in the years following the war. In the early stages, the plantation remained the most common unit with free men working on it for a share of the crops, but soon enough a true sharecropping system developed. Black men were granted pieces of land to work, and when the year was over the owners returned to them a share of the crop produced. By 1870 sharecropping was so common in the South that it made any other system seem unusual.

When the boy displeased his father, the father examined the cause of his misconduct and decided that he needed to be punished for his mischief. According to the International Journal of Ethics, \"every shortcoming in a child should be traced to its beginnings, and punishment is meant to direct disobedience to its natural result-pain.\" This is what the lieutenant believed.","Rather the punishing the child then and there, the father left his son to anticipate what was to come.

","\"My jacket,\" replied the boy.","\"Well, what have you got under it?\" demanded the father.","\"A leather apron four double,\" he replied.","\"A leather apron, have you indeed And what's that for?\"","\"Why pa, you told me to prepare for a flogging, and I got as well prepared as I could,\" he stated with a serious face.

As Ford glanced across Spring  River, which was the only thing separating Ford's army from General Sigel's Federal troops, he was mesmerized: \"I could not help admiring for their beautiful movements in their formation line of battle.\"   He knew his men had a small chance of winning the skirmish, but they had no choice.  Suddenly, gunfire erupted.  The battle of Carthage had begun.","    The battle raged on for hours.  It was a back and forth affair, as each side would rally after what seemed like defeat.  Desperate for a victory, Captain Hiram, a colleague of Ford's, commanded the Confederate soldiers to throw anything they could at General Sigel's men.  The cavalry threw rocks and pieces of iron.  Soon, General Sigel began to retreat from the constant bombardment.  Before long, Ford and the cavalry had pushed him back ten miles from Carthage, sealing the Confederate victory.  After the battle, Sigel, reflecting on the battle, applauded the efforts of the Confederate cavalry: \"if [I] had such men in [my] command...[I] would not be afraid to charge hell and capture the devil.\"","    While the determination and drive of the Missouri soldiers threw General Sigel off guard, their resolve is not surprising.  The Kansas-Missouri conflict served as a prelude to the Civil War.  Each state dealt with raids and guerilla warfare on a consistent basis beginning in 1854, so the two states were in the midst of the conflict when the War Between the States broke out.  When the war officially started, Lincoln's top priority was to try and secure the loyalty of the Border   States.  While Lincoln was able to attract Kansas to the Union cause, Missouri, a slave state, sympathized with the Southern plight and, while it never seceded, did favor the Confederacy.  This division between Kansas and Missouri only reinforced the hostility.  For the soldiers in Captain Ford's company, they not only saw Federal troops before them - they saw Kansas, the neighbors they hated the most.  This hatred led each side to fight harder than they might have had there been no rivalry prior to the war.  Their border war manifested itself in the Civil War.  Missouri became a symbol for the way the rest of the South should fight as their sacrifice and passion would set the standard for the rest of the Confederacy during the Civil War.

For instance, Southerners began to change their diets to help keep their immune system strong for the summer seasons.

For example, alcoholism and risky sexual behavior seemed to increase the likelihood of disease, as these bad habits lead to terrible hygiene and sloppiness, which left people susceptible to disease.  ","    It was the local doctors who stood at the center of this disease prevention and control.  Their importance in the community was significant as they provided remedies when all else failed.  Members of the community depended on them for guidance and advice.  In the South, they were not only doctors.  They were a part of the community.  This sense of belonging pushed local physicians to work extra hard in finding cures for ailments.  After all, these infected people were more than just patients.  They were neighbors, family members and friends.

Being sold to the Deep South was possibly one of the greatest fears of many Upper or Border South slaves. The prospect of being sold away from family and friends was considered by some, a worse punishment than whipping. ","            According to historian William W.

In comparison, after the \"tobacco bust of the eighteenth century,\" the Border South was much more industrial, grew a wider variety of crops, and was more economically diversified and willing to sell their slaves \"down the river\" for a high profit. Most slaveholding southerners claimed to look down on these slave traders who made transactions possible, but according to historian Jeanette Keith, Isaac Franklin and his partner John Armfield were two of the most affluent and successful slave traders in the United   States. They later retired wealthy, purchased their own plantations, and married into elite families in Tennessee. They were also prominent Methodists.

Although these apprehensions existed, for the most part the temperance movement was successful in incorporating women of various \"socio-economic, racial, religious, and national identities.\" Many women used the Bible to justify temperance; they claimed that it was God's plan for women to help the men and \"most commonly likened women...to Christ's apostles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> does not mention the demographic or religious background of the picnic's guests having had any effect; in fact, it says there \"was no disorder.\" This furthers the idea that locals were unified by a common aspiration. ","Although temperance is traditionally associated with women against alcohol consumption, at the time, it was just as important in promoting white women's overall equality.  For example, the WCTU helped educate women \"to take on public personas because the nineteenth century offered [them] limited formal education in rhetoric.\"  Often, people saw the strive for equality as radical.  Thus, as historian Carol Mattingly writes, \"newspaper reporting focused largely on issues of gender rather than on the subject of temperance\" which she says \"reflects a general discomfort with women's changing roles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dot</em>s, on the other hand, presents an article focused on the issue of temperance as opposed to gender.  This is likely because the focus of their gathering was \"not yet Congress, Legislature, Judge, Jury, Church or state;...but the Rum Traffic, was the prisoner at the bar.\" Long-term changes for women, such as the Nineteenth Amendment, would not occur for some time. Still, the nineteenth-century temperance movement fueled the steps towards gender equality.  Events such as the Shenandoah County Temperance Picnic, although small, represented a larger movement that took place throughout the South."],"locations":[{"id":14271,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}]},{"id":3956,"title":"The Education of African Americans After the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-01-01","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Our crops are poor on account of too much wet in the summer which prevented us from working with them,\" John McClure, a resident of Albemarle  County, wrote to his aunt and uncle.  He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.  Unfortunately, though, with the turn of the century, Edward Ayers notes that \"blacks in the south paid for schools for whites--not the other way around.  The more black citizens in a county, the greater the benefits to white students.\"  Racial tensions would not disappear for some time."],"locations":[{"id":13600,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}]},{"id":3957,"title":"Virginia Governor John Floyds Thoughts on Nullification\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-19","end_date":"1832-12-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Virginia residents opened up their newspapers one morning in December 1832 and discovered an address from the governor, John Floyd.  He wrote to the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates in regards to the South Carolina Nullification Ordinance, and the newspaper posted this as an article for locals.  Floyd explained that South Carolina felt the Tariffs took advantage of it and the state had \"declared those laws unconstitutional.\"  In South   Carolina's defense, he noted that its state had implored Congress to overturn those laws many times, but that \"all this had been disregarded by that body.\"  Although Floyd first presented South Carolina's motives for nullification, he went on to note the potentially negative consequences of this action.  The Virginia governor warned that \"should force be resorted to by the Federal Government, the horror of the scenes hereafter to be witnessed cannot now be pictured even by the affrighted imagination.\"  Floyd presented both sides of the issue.  ","Floyd's desires for how Virginians should respond to nullification, more clearly revealed his inclinations.  Historians describe the governor as a \"states' rights advocate\" who \"originally opposed secession.\" These two ideas seemingly conflicted with each other.  Floyd promoted an all-encompassing stance that would preserve South Carolina's rights and also promoted the ideal of limiting Congressional powers without endorsing nullification. He said that first there should be \"an investigation of the causes, with a view to a redress of grievances.\"  However, he acknowledged that South Carolina had already attempted to do this and failed.  Thus, he said the next step was \"an amicable reference...to the great tribunal which formed and adopted the constitution, viz: the PEOPLE of the States themselves.\"  Floyd went so far as to say that if the people could not settle the issue peacefully, it would essentially disparage the ideas of \"liberty\" and \"self-government.\"  Therefore, he presented the state of Virginia with two choices: to support South  Carolina and engage in potential Civil War or to \"appeal to the States of the Union.\"  He warned that the former of the two choices would result in \"fire-side altars bathed in blood,\" and that the latter decision would enable \"the maintenance of...harmony.\"  Floyd presented the two options as having completley different consequences.","Virginia had a task: historian William Freehling explains that ultimately \"the Virginia legislature, even while sending [an official commissioner] to stop South Carolina from nullifying [the tarrifs], affirmed that any state could legally secede.\"  Although Virginia remained in the Union until the fall of Fort Sumter, it did not condemn the actions of the secessionists around it.  This somewhat conciliatory legislative action, as Floyd suggested, would have less severe effects. Interestingly, though, Floyd eventually became a promoter of secession, a Confederate general, and as historians note, \"resigned under charges of financial cheating and transferring arms to the South.\"  Overall, it is evident that Virginians initially took a moderate stance, hoping to avoid confrontation.  As time progressed, however, many people modified their attitudes and behaviors, as exemplified by Governor Floyd and Virginia's eventual secession."],"locations":[{"id":13654,"lat":37.3167903952,"lng":-79.5201576467,"zoom":9,"place":"BEDFORD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":3958,"title":"To Protect and Serve: Overlooked White Crimes\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-09-03","end_date":"1890-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The black woman was badly injured.

The family maintained hope that they would finally see racial equality and justice converge.  Unfortunately, however, the day that the beaten woman would receive the justice she truly deserved would never come. ","            On September 3, 1890, Policeman Saunders was on duty, patrolling a largely white neighborhood in Charlottesville,  Virginia.   He focused his attention on an innocent black woman who seemed out of place in the area.  After questioning the \"suspicious\" woman, Policeman Saunders decided to arrest her.  The woman resisted the seemingly unwarranted arrest and the result was bloodshed.  The police officer brutally beat the woman over the head numerous times with his billet.  As news of the savage beating spread throughout Charlottesville, individuals of the black community banded together, demanding that the officer be tried for excessive and unjust force.   The demands of justice by the black community were ignored by the white politicians and the police officer went unpunished.  ","            Black inferiority was an uncontested aspect of the South during late 1800s.  The failure of Reconstruction allowed blatant racism to become an accepted part of the Southern states.   Whites often used violence to instill fear in the minds of black Southerners in an attempt to regain the level of control which they had prior to the Civil War.  This rampant violence and widespread fear shaped and defined the relationships between blacks and whites during the late nineteenth century.   To remedy this overt discrimination in the Southern states, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which made it illegal to discriminate against blacks by assigning them an inferior legal and economic status.  Approximately two years later the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing \"equal protection of the laws\" to every American citizen.   In response to this legislation, however, the Southern states passed a new set of laws that \"permitted local officials to informally discriminate against blacks.\"   The actions of the Southern states following national legislation indicate a desperate effort to retain a position a position of superiority over newly freed black Southerners.  Unfortunately, the desperate attempt to maintain a sense of white supremacy in the South resulted in the disappearance of any form of legal justice in the black community.  The absence of legal action against Policeman Saunders is just one example of the widespread acts of injustice which plagued blacks across the United   States following the abolition of slavery.

Like many Southern newspapers, <em>The Camden Confederate</em> tried to provide people on the home front with as much information as possible regarding the progress of the war, but the information available was not always plentiful or completely reliable.

As talk of secession began in the late 1850s, leaders in the South began to push for citizens to identify with their state or region rather than the United   States. Once southern states began to leave the Union, this loyalty became even more important to allow the new nation any chance of success. During the Civil War itself, there was little more important than presenting a united home front dedicated to the triumph of the Confederacy. Newspapers such as <em>The Camden Confederate</em> played a key role in advocating Confederate nationalism. This nationalism, extremely strong at the beginning of the Civil War, was not enough to hold the Confederacy together, and as the war drew to a close, so did the intense Southern unity. This is, however, a disputed analysis of Confederate nationalism. Other historians claim that the South remained a united front throughout the war, and a loss of unity has no place in the discussion of the South.

The most promising option was to begin actively engaging in the slave trade.  Young healthy slaves could often sell for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  The recent migration of planters to the Mississippi Delta from the Chesapeake region had increased the demand for slaves even further.

This is interesting because his brother, as a resident of Virginia, likely owned slaves himself or was at least exposed to slavery on a daily basis.  In fact, many slaves from Virginia and Maryland were sent to the Deep  South where the demand was much greater for them.  This was because the tobacco boom had come and gone in the Chesapeake while the cotton and sugar rush was just beginning in Louisiana.  The struggling farmer told his brother that the slave trade \"is both a positive good for master and slave.\"  It is easy to see what \"positive good\" the master received, but Kinney failed to mention how this process was beneficial to the slave.  He must have forgotten that slaves were often separated from their families and forced to start life anew whenever they were sold, causing much grief and heartbreak.

For Emma, the only highlight of the month appeared in the assassination of President Lincoln: \"After all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light.\" A common, unfortunate theme throughout her April diary entries was the rationing of food and a severe lack of funds available for more than the basic necessities.

Though her concern for her father's ill health was quite natural, it was quite surprising to learn of her distaste for such a grand and important Southern city such as Charleston and her accompanying lack of \"any desire to visit town.\" Her large amount of leisure time, however, exposes Mrs. Huger's status as an elite white Southern woman.

Advertisements present in the Norfolk-based newspaper attempted to sell goods such as Christmas supplies, hats, and chlorine tooth wash. While these impersonal objects were goods commonly traded and sold in the marketplace, the advertisement section also included references to Southern property that had run away from their masters. Perhaps the most telling aspect of these advertisements was that no significant distinction was made between missing cattle and missing slaves. To the slave master, steers and slaves were equal under the nature of the law: both were fundamental illustrations of private property. ","To comprehend the importance of the <em>Beacon's </em>advertisements, it is essential to understand the Southern belief that slaves were inherently the property of their masters. This prevalent reasoning had predated the Constitution and was deeply entrenched in Southern culture by 1832. Records from the debates of the Constitutional Convention, presented in the <em>Cambridge Modern History</em>, illustrate that Southerners held a consensus that \"slaves were property only; like other property, they were entirely subject to the wills of the master.\" This conception was no different from the perception regarding steers. In the two advertisements aforementioned, the descriptions of the missing cattle and runaway slaves relied solely upon physical peculiarities. While the two missing steers had \"marks under half moon under the right ear,\" the runaway slave named Lucy was \"stout\" with a \"very yellow complexion.\" In both circumstances, vested rights in private property possessed by the plantation owner dictated that the property be returned. ","The Southern perception of slaves as \"chattel property,\" mirrored in the two advertisements of the <em>American Beacon</em>,<em> </em>supports an underlying observation that blacks and cattle held equal rights under <em>de facto</em> Southern law. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"chattel\" is defined as \"a personal possession.\" As previously stated, slaves in the South were considered \"property...subject to the wills of their masters.\" The words \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" share a common language origin; both terms come from the Old French word \"chatel,\" which arises from the Latin word \"caput,\" meaning \"head.\" By relegating slaves to the restricted rights and properties of chattel, slave owners fundamentally equalized the rights of slaves and the rights of cattle. As a result, listing rewards for runaway slaves next to advertisements for runaway cattle, chlorine tooth wash, and medical elixirs was not conflicting in either intention or theory.  ","From expressed Southern mentality and advertisements found in the <em>Beacon</em>, it becomes readily apparent that blacks and whites were not regarded as equal beings under the encompassing mantle of equal protection. Blacks, bought and sold as mere chattel, were only regarded as equals to steers, \"glass beads,\" and \"harmonical walking canes.\" The subsequent equality under the law and inherent relation between steers and slaves was a founding principle of the Southern plantation economy, helping preserve the institution of slavery until the conclusion of the Civil War.

We will be pleased to know that the unpleasant matter is settled.\" ","On December 30, 1885, Phillip Haxall, President of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, penned the preceding sentences in a letter to Chairman William H. Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency. Industry in Richmond would never be the same."],"locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}]},{"id":3972,"title":"Tariffs and Agriculture\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-07","end_date":"1897-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1897 the<em> Rockbridge County News</em> released its weekly edition in the town of Lexington.  One specific article presented the news of a new tariff bill to be passed by the United States House of Representatives.  This bill was designed to protect young American manufacturers and the economy from competing foreign markets.  The article also gave insight into the fact that many Rockbridge  County residents were unsure the new bill would protect industry and decrease the treasury's debt at the same time.  They hoped the bill would not pass through the House because the tariff would hurt their agricultural society.  The residents believed it was unintelligent to tax foreign imports that Americans had no way of producing themselves, such as coffee.  Moreover, with the passing of this bill United States manufacturers could then charge American consumers, like the Rockbridge County residents, higher prices.  According to the article, this tariff would help the Northern economy but harm the South.  ","There have been many such bills throughout the history of the United   States, especially in the years after Reconstruction.  All of them had the same goal of protecting the domestic economy.  The dispute over tariffs boiled down to the Northern Republicans against the Southern Democrats.  The Republicans claimed they were protecting American industry but they were actually protecting themselves, since Republican voters owned the majority of the industrial United States.  Democrats countered with the fact that tariffs only brought harm to the South. Southerners had to buy imported goods at high prices and they had to buy expensive domestic goods as well because American manufacturers were raising their prices in response to no foreign competition.  In addition, Southerners had difficulty selling their agricultural goods in an angry foreign market.  The Southern Democrats fought hard against any and all tariffs because they knew it was the key to the South's survival.  It was no wonder why the residents of Rockbridge  County were against the bill passing.

James and his wife, Betsey Blackwell, had moved to Cooper County, Missouri in the late 1830s from Virginia, with Octavia, Betsey's sister, and her husband. James' letter in 1842 was one of several written by him, Betsey, and Octavia to the rest of the Blackwell family, who remained in Fauquier   County, Virginia. In these letters, they described their new lives in Missouri and enquired after their greatly missed relatives and friends. ","James and Betsey did not fare well in Missouri at first and James had to write to Elizabeth Blackwell in 1842 to ask for money. He described how he had to buy everything on store accounts because he had no credit, and as a result, store owners charged him more than the normal price. James had sold three of his horses to pay for the journey to Missouri and his remaining horse had gone blind, further impeding him from making enough profit to buy some land. Reflecting on his misfortune, James advised Elizabeth to \"tell everybody that wants to come here not to come if they have no money.\" In another letter written to Elizabeth Blackwell, her cousin, Sarah, also described the challenges of moving to Missouri, saying that \"in this new country Virginians have to encounter many hardships and undergo many privations...all who are well situated in Virginia had best stay.\" ","The Blackwells were one of many thousands of families who moved to Missouri in the nineteenth century. As described in \"Westward Expansion\", immigration began on a large scale after the War of 1812 reduced the Native American threat and as reports of prosperity in Missouri spread across the country. The letters do not explain why the Blackwells moved to Missouri, but usually immigration was motivated by economic reasons and possibly the Blackwell family was too big for them to all remain in Virginia. However, the Blackwell family would not have been the very poorest in society, for as James' description suggests, it was not possible for the poorest to move. The trip was costly, so the Blackwell family must have been relatively wealthy to be able to get to Missouri in the first place. James' letter also demonstrates that not all were immediately successful when moving to the new land.","Missouri settlers from the Old South brought with them the values of the society they had left behind. This meant that religion and slavery came to dominate Missouri life. Octavia wrote to Elizabeth in 1848 telling her that \"we are not in a heathen land but we have preaching and praying in abundance.\" Betsey described in 1842 going to a church in Missouri and feeling delighted, as it reminded her of home. The Blackwells' views on slavery are not clear but it seems that some blacks, who could possibly have been slaves or servants of the Blackwell family, travelled with them to Missouri. Octavia included in her letters messages from \"blacks\" to their family and friends in Virginia.  ","Immigrating to Missouri posed challenges for the new settlers but life did not change drastically. Life still centred on births, marriages and deaths, with all three consistently mentioned in the Blackwell's letters.  In addition, the health of each family member was still a main topic of conversation in the letters. Even though the Blackwells could not see each other frequently, family ties were still strong. Each letter contained a plea that their relatives in Virginia write back to them with all their news.

Johnston's photograph gallery in Wytheville, Virginia. Her portrait, like the other nine in the 1881 collection of photographs from western Virginia was taken as a solo frame and was presented as a \"carte-de-visite,\" or postcard.  Although the portrait did not reveal anything about Stella Haas except her hometown, the image implied much about Southern life after 1877. Reconstruction brought many changes to those who lived below the Mason-Dixon line and the influence of Northern culture and ideals was quite apparent in this portrait of Ms. Haas. ","    Stella's photo was taken a few years after Reconstruction and there was obvious Northern influence in what she chose to wear. On the day of her sitting, Stella was dressed in a tailored pin-stripe jacket with a slim fitting floor-length skirt. This outfit, almost the opposite of what Southern women wore in the antebellum South, reflected how the North influenced life after the Civil War. Ms. Haas was not dressed in a hoop skirt with excessive amounts of lace and embellishment, typical of most Southern women in the antebellum South. Rather, her outfit was more demure and humble, and though the photograph was taken in black and white, her ensemble did not appear to be very colorful.","    Southern women were expected to be pure, graceful, and delicate, while these social standards of Southern femininity may have continued into the late nineteenth century, Stella Haas represented very few of them. Her face was expressionless, but this was more reflected in her modest and harsh visage.  Although these characteristics suggest that Stella was not of affluent means, this was probably not the case. Photography was a developing medium in the late nineteenth century and not many people could afford to spend money on the material activity except for middle class and relatively wealthy. Fashion often characterized a culture and the elite South prior to 1877 was defined by an emphasis on extravagance and adornment, especially in peoples' dress. Stella Haas' portrait exemplified none of these antebellum qualities and it appears that the Northern emphasis on practicality and modesty became more prevalent in the South after Reconstruction.

In January 1884, Mrs. James Bennett argued in Kentucky's legislature that women should receive the vote in presidential elections. She provided several arguments, including the fact that men of poor morals and low status in society were able to vote whilst a \"noble Christian women\" was not. In addition, she cited the Thirteenth Amendment and emphasized that a state could not make or enforce any law that shall abridge the privileges or immunities of \"citizens of the United states,\" which was defined as persons born or naturalized in the United States. However, her main argument was a religious one; she claimed that God wanted women to vote and thus argued that men who opposed suffrage and women who accepted their disenfranchisement were disobeying God.","Mrs. James Bennett cited an argument by Herbert Spencer, an English philosopher, who argued that happiness can be achieved only by the exercise of one's faculties. According to Bennett, God wills everyone's happiness, which means exercising one's faculties. Subsequently, as women have the faculty to vote, it follows that God thus wills that they vote. After this Bennett drew on passages from the Bible to show that it does not oppose female suffrage, as was commonly thought. She argued that the passage, where wives are told to \"submit themselves unto their own husbands, as unto the Lord; for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church\", supports the submission of wives to their husbands but it does not justify men ruling over them. God gave the world to both men and women, even if women are weaker and more dependent on men. Bennett also described the important role many women played in the Bible and the spread of Christianity. This all shows the equality of men and women before God and supported Bennett's view that God wills female suffrage.","As Bennett herself acknowledged, she was not the first to argue for female suffrage but was part of an ever growing movement that had begun decades earlier. Bennett explained that she only became convinced of the need for female suffrage after she heard Susan B. Antony talk in Richmond. Susan B. Antony was an important leader in the suffrage movement, she founded the National Woman's Suffrage Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1869 and later served as its president. The movement for suffrage was national, but Bennett described how she had little support in Kentucky. Kentucky was the first state to give school suffrage to women, but according to Madeline McDowell it lagged behind many states in other areas. For example, in 1888, four years after Bennett's speech, Kentucky was \"the only state that did not permit a married woman to make a will and a wife's wages might be collected by her husband.\"","Not only was the suffrage movement slow to develop in Kentucky, but also the South as a whole lagged behind the North. The suffrage movement started in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention, but it spread to the South much later. Elna Green accounts for the slow adoption of suffrage in the South by the fact that \"southern women trailed a generation behind their northeastern sisters in the critical experiences that produced support for woman suffrage.\" The critical experiences she cited were the result of industrialization, which occurred at a slower pace in the South.","Despite little support in Kentucky, Bennett claimed that men could not ignore women's demands for suffrage for much longer. In fact, women were only granted suffrage in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, 36 years after Mrs. Bennett's speech. However, the suffrage movement had been successful in Kentucky, as it was only one of four states in the South that ratified the amendment."],"locations":[{"id":4828,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}]},{"id":3976,"title":"West Virginia Refuses Reunification\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-03-01","end_date":"1866-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["West Virginia would not consider reunification in 1866. In 1866, Governor Boreman of West Virginia responded to Alexander H. H. Stuart's letter, which had asked Boreman for West Virginia's stance on reunification and the settlement of state debt. Boreman wrote that if the Virginia commissioners, whom Stuart numbered among, had presented themselves in front of the West Virginian legislature they would have been \"met with a most respectful and courteous reception at the hands of the members yet I think I am not mistaken in saying that a proposition for the reunion of the states would not have been entertained for a moment but would have been rejected by the unanimous vote of both houses.\" Boreman then went on to write that the legislature would have been happy to consider the debt question, but \"not being advised of any movement in the General Assembly of Virginia they delayed the matter until it was dropped.\" ","Secession from Virginia was the result of long-held divisions within Virginia but it would not have happened without the Civil War and Virginia's decision to secede from the Union. It was only following this decision that a convention was held to declare West Virginia separate in May 1861. This started the process which eventually led to Lincoln's recognition of the division of Virginia in 1863. West Virginia was not interested in reunification in 1866 as they had long seen themselves as separate from the rest of Virginia. They resented the fact that east Virginia had better representation in Congress, as its constituencies were smaller. In addition, the tax breaks of those in the slave-holding east angered the west, as slaveholders were exempt from paying taxes on their slaves. Geographic divisions further helped create a feeling of separation and an unwillingness to defend their neighbors in the east against the Union.","Debt became a problem for Virginia following the Civil War as Virginia had been the battleground for the war and was now devastated as a result. In addition, West Virginia's secession had deprived Virginia of a third of its tax-paying population. Virginia thus needed to ensure that West   Virginia shared the burden of debt from costs incurred before the Civil War. However, this was not resolved quickly; it was only in 1911 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling which forced West Virginia to pay its share of the debt. This delay in resolving the debt question helped cause the decline of the Old Dominion.

On May 1 1856, the <em>Nashville Union and American</em> published an article criticizing the party. The article claimed that the aim of the recently created Know-Nothing Party was the abolition of slavery and, in particular, to \"defeat any attempt to introduce Kansas into the union as a slave state.\"  Know-Nothingism was further blamed for \"the creation of new political secret organizations, heretofore unknown in our country's history, and incompatible with our institutions and the spirit liberty.\" The writer then praised the Democratic Party, as it was the only party that offered \"guarantees of order and tranquility. It is a tribute due to genuine patriotism and to unfaltering attachment to republican principles.\"","The Know- Nothing Party grew out of a secret society formed in New York in early 1849 by Charles B. Allen called the \"Order of the Star-Spangled Banner.\" Its original aim was to control nominations for elections rather than stand independently in elections, but in 1852 it merged with a new party called the American Party and it became directly involved in politics. The members of the American Party were nicknamed Know-Nothings, which referred to the response that they were meant to give when asked about the society's activities. The Know-Nothing Party was originally opposed to Catholic involvement in politics and the increasing numbers of foreigners in the country.  However, there was a split between Know-Nothings in the North and South, as those from the South played down their hostility to foreigners or Catholics as, on the whole, these issues were not as important to southerners. In some areas of the South, such as port cities, nativism was an important factor behind the growth of the Know-Nothing Party but elsewhere the Know-Nothing popularity \"was instead dependent on long-standing rifts between Democrats on economic policy and the sectional conflict.\"","The party did not last a long time but in the 1850s it was believed that they would become the official opposition party to the Democrats. The Know-Nothing Party was originally meant to be bi-partisan, but increasingly became involved in partisan politics, with the Democrats accusing them of being \"whiggery in disguise.\" The Democrats felt threatened by the Know-Nothings and so accused them of being against slavery, as this would ensure that the Know-Nothings would loose support in the South. <em>Nashville Union and American</em>, was resolutely Democratic and consistently criticized the Know-Nothing Party. In 1855 it even adopted the slogan \"let's get more European immigrants to settle in the South to help swell our numbers to defend slavery\" However, as Erik B. Alexander has argued, in reality, most Know-Nothings in the South were against the abolition of slavery.","In 1857 the Know-Nothing Party's influence in Tennessee politics ended. In 1856 their candidate in the presidential election came third, and in 1857 they lost Tennessee's Congressional elections.

W. Parmalee, a South Carolina businessman, maintained close correspondence with an individual by the name of \"Wheeler\" in a series of letters spanning from 1848 to 1850. One topic of interest evident in Parmalee's letters was politics, with a particular focus on the sectional tension between the North and South. Parmalee's commentary on the sectional crisis echoed the sentiments shared by many Southerners at the time. \"We are, as a people, in a state of considerable political excitement,\" he wrote of the Southern attitude. Parmalee then went on to discuss Southerners' desire for \"equal rights under the Constitution,\" a fundamental principle that Congress had, in his opinion, violated. He also addressed the divisive issue of slavery that had begun to wear at the ties of the Union throughout the 1840s and 1850s.","Parmalee argued that \"slavery as it exists in the Southern states is as benevolent an institution as there is within our [country].\" Southerners at the time made this claim to defend the institution and way of life they were fighting to protect as a means of civilizing and humanizing the black race. Furthermore, the South was an agrarian society, and slavery, many believed, was vital to maintaining the prosperity of that agricultural economy. It had been deeply rooted in Southern culture for decades, and the recent rise of the abolitionist movement threatened that lifestyle both economically and socially. Southerners justified the institution of slavery on historical, Biblical, racial, and moral grounds. Parmalee's opinions from his letters also reflect the paternalist interpretation of slavery and the widely held belief in the South that \"slavery was a necessary institution of social control.\"","Paternalism was the relationship between slave and master based upon the idea of reciprocal duty and the acknowledgment of the slave as a human being, rather than just property.

Such a complete picture of small-town Southern life is hard to come upon in the modern day, especially considering historian Robert Oliver's assertion that \"many Southern women abruptly stopped writing in their journals and diaries when the [Civil] war ended.\" Nevertheless, Emmala Reed's journal touched upon an extraordinary amount of subject matter, specifically the dire economic situation of her town, health and familial issues, her own failing relationship with a Confederate surgeon, and the progress of relations between blacks and whites in the Anderson area. In so doing, Reed contributed wholeheartedly to a living history of South Carolina; as Civil War author Jacqueline Campbell puts it, women like Reed \"assum[ed] active, and vocal, roles in the creation of historical memory.\"","    Among Reed's entries, the scene that occurred on June 8, 1865, is particularly interesting; so too are the ideas that it suggests on the state of race relations in South Carolina and elsewhere in the South immediately following the War Between the States. It is an extreme exaggeration to suggest that relations between southern whites and newly freed blacks were anything but hostile in the early Reconstruction period; even so, the events that Emmala Reed witnessed on the night of June 8, 1865, call into serious doubt the extent of amicable relations <em>whatsoever</em> between blacks and whites. Reed's journal entry certainly proves this, for she observed the frightening picture of \"an innocent, peaceable negro all thought, taken from his frightened wife, taken out, his house searched, and (then) he was shot and left lying in the street the next morning.\" All this occurred due to the vengeance of a lynch mob operating in the town of Anderson, yet according to a traumatized Reed, \"no [citizen] knows who perpetrated the dark deed - nor for what reason - all excitement.\" Such occurrences of racism were not only common during early Reconstruction, but would also continue to appear for quite some time in South Carolina and across the South, proving that many whites in the region remained \"strongly committed to white supremacy.\"","     Reconstruction in South Carolina and in the rest of the former Confederacy was meant to turn the tides of racism and inequality that had been entrenched in the region for nearly two hundred years. In the long run, this racism would die out. Nevertheless, early Reconstruction strayed far from its purpose, a tolerance and freedom meant to apply to <em>two</em> races for the first time. More accurately, early Reconstruction efforts led to a southern culture of racial despair and hostility, one considered by Emmala Reed to be \"a horrible, disorganized state of society.\""],"locations":[{"id":11429,"lat":34.519117434,"lng":-82.637883414,"zoom":9,"place":"ANDERSON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}]},{"id":3981,"title":"Nicaraguan Affairs\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-19","end_date":"1856-05-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Monday May 19, 1856, the headline story of the Daily Dispatch was entitled \"Nicaraguan Affairs,\" a topic that was prevalent among many of the newspaper's articles that month. This particular article discussed how Central America would potentially provide the United States with routes of passage for naval ships.  These naval transit routes, specifically a possible Nicaraguan canal, would better enable the United States Navy to protect the nation from the threat of other nations.  Of particular interest to the United States was the Straight of Isthmus, which connected North and South America, for \"to us, on account of its geographical position and of our political interest as an American State, of primary magnitude, that Isthmus is of peculiar importance.\"  This strip of land was of great much importance to the maritime nations as it could potentially provide a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  ","At the time of this article a new Nicaraguan president, William Walker, was elected.  He called for an alliance with the United States, including an initiative of annexing Nicaragua to the United States as a slave state.  Soldiers from the United States went to Nicaragua in an effort to aid Walker in his bid to power for the Isthmus as a maritime transit route that would benefit both Nicaragua and the United States. William Mason, who went to fight in Nicaragua from the Virginia Military Institute, was passionate about the Nicaraguan issue and journeyed through Mississippi and Louisiana to gather other men who wished to fight for this cause.","Nicaragua's call for annexation to the United States was clearly an important issue at the time.  Its acquisition would have given greater power to the United States in its effort to obtain this transit route that would ultimately have given more power to the nation.  Ultimately the unstable political situation in Nicaragua posed too much of a hazard to the United States' troops and therefore the United States looked for different options in an acquisition of a canal.  The Nicaraguan issue's prevalence in the newspapers and in the passions of men such as William Mason, who willingly gave his life in Nicaragua, gave insight to its importance and the importance of a maritime transit route to the American people.

In Hampden-Sidney College's yearly publication, The Kaleidoscope, students shared stories of pranks, sports victories, and rigorous course loads that could easily have been written by a college student today.  However, the influence of Greek life was much greater in the nineteenth century.  Especially at all-male schools, like many of the best were, fraternities were not an option, they were a way of life.","    The first collegiate society bearing Greek letters was founded at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1776.  This fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was founded as a secret organization with the express purpose of exploring and discussing literature with the other members of the society.  Phi Beta Kappa remained the only Greek letter organization on the collegiate scene until the founding of Chi Delta Theta at Yale in 1821.  Chi Delta Theta had a similar philosophy to Phi Beta Kappa, but was generally too large to encourage bonding and brotherhood amongst members.  The first fraternity that bore any resemblance to the modern social fraternity was Kappa Alpha, founded at Union College in 1825.  In 1827, Union was also the cradle for the creation of Sigma Phi and Delta Phi.  These three organizations became known as the Union Triad and were the models for other Greek letter organizations to follow.","    The first social fraternity to charter in the South was known as the Mystical Seven, and was founded at Emory College in 1841 and at Franklin College, later known as the University of Georgia, in 1844.  However, the first distinctively \"southern\" fraternity, WWW, was founded at the University of Mississippi in 1842.  The second fraternity to be deemed southern in nature was Sigma Alpha Epsilon, founded at the University of Alabama in 1856.  The dichotomy between southern and northern fraternities became clear during the Civil War.  Collegiate activity was largely suspended during the war, and although no new fraternities were founded, national pride became instilled in the brotherhoods.  After the war, many southern schools refused to re-charter fraternities that were founded in the North, and even went so far as to establish the Southern and Northern Orders of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity. ","    Fraternal rivalries existed not only between northern and southern fraternities, but also between fraternities at individual colleges.  As the Kaleidoscope shows, Hampden-Sidney chose to form a Pan-Hellenic council with representatives from each fraternity to ameliorate feuds between the young men.  The \"spirit of Pan-Hellenism\" at Hampden-Sidney was preserved through this council, and Pan-Hellenic councils still exists at many Universities today.  ","    In the grand scheme of American history, fraternities have played a much larger role than that any other collegiate social clubs have.  During the nineteenth century, the southern fraternity grew from a simple social organization to an institution used to perpetuate southern ideals and lifestyles.  Some of these ideals are very positive, such as honor, scholastic achievement, and brotherhood.  However, the southern fraternity has also become a vehicle to preserve less progressive ideals, such as racism, classism, and geographic discrimination.

In fact, Delaware was the only slaveholding state to enact prohibition laws in the 1850s.  However, temperance reform victories can be seen on a smaller, yet equally effective, scale throughout the southern United States, especially among young men.  The Southern temperance movement was driven by fraternal organizations of men, and eventually women, holding each other to the standard of temperance and encouraging themselves and others to lead a temperate lifestyle.","    The Sons of Temperance was the most widely known fraternal temperance organization.  The Order was founded by temperance advocates in New York City in 1842 but quickly became a nationally recognized brotherhood.  Its three goals were clearly laid out in the constitution of the organization, which \"proposed then, as it does now, three distinct objects-To shield its members from the evils of intemperance; afford mutual assistance in case of sickness, and elevate their character as men.\"  ","    Fraternal temperance orders became exceedingly popular in the south as the nineteenth century progressed.  Members from slave states comprised 44 percent of the national membership of the Sons of Temperance in 1850.  This is especially important because the Sons did not admit African Americans, and the South only represented 32 percent of the nation's total white population.  The Independent Order of Good Templars was another prominent fraternal organization dedicated to temperance, and also boasted a large southern participation rate.","    These orders tended to function like secret societies and rarely published their membership lists.  This was largely done in order to limit bad press.  It would have been extremely embarrassing for a brother to be seen violating the codes of the Order, and secrecy eliminated the possibility of bad exposure.  Another reason for secrecy became important when sectional differences began to get out of hand.  Since the society had Northern roots and linkages, many Southern chapters kept their activity under wraps so as not to anger the political powers at hand.

It all began in 1828 when Congress enacted the so-called Tariff of Abominations. Many Southerners thought the highly protective tariff was detrimental to agrarian interests.  Under the leadership of John C. Calhoun, South Carolina stated that a national tariff was unconstitutional when it benefited some states and not others.  To ease tension, President Andrew Jackson lowered the tariff in July 1832.  It was not enough.  ","In November of 1832, South Carolina's Nullification Convention met and pronounced both tariffs unconstitutional as well as unenforceable.  If the national government made any attempt to enforce the tariff, South Carolina would secede from the Union.  In response, Jackson sent the tactical strategist Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott and \"five additional companies of Artillery and two companies of the fourth regiment of Infantry\" to Charleston.  On December 10, 1832, Jackson sent a message to South Carolina declaring its actions \"inconsistent\" and \"incompatible.\"  ","While South Carolina reacted vehemently to the tariff, many Virginians demurred.  South     Carolina's governor James Hamilton mentioned that Nullification was a \"peaceful and constitutional\" remedy.  The Lynchburg Virginian, however, scoffed at his diction and saw war and revolution ahead, not peace.  Governor Hamilton readied the State Guard in Charleston and requested the removal of U.S. troops from the state citadel in Charleston.  The paper claimed, \" war is no children's game - least of all, civil war, in which personal revenge is so apt to mingle with the public quarrel.\"  Though Lynchburg was against the actions of its Southern neighbor, Whigs in Richmond were inclined toward Nullification.  In the coming years, Virginia's divisive tendencies would play a more important role."," After the threat of military action, South Carolina agreed to compromise and a much lower tariff was passed in 1833.

Hampton, a former Confederate general, was playing on Southern sentiments to urge Virginia to back Democratic presidential candidate Winfield Hancock, a Union general.  Fifteen years after the close of the Civil War, politicians were still coercing voters to elect candidates on sectional lines.  ","    Despite Hampton's speech, the Republican ticket won and James A. Garfield became the president in the smallest popular vote victory in American history.

","    Because tariffs were the only real issue of the 1880 election, the politicians spun the debate to the polarizing issue of North and South.   The Lynchburg Virginian held that the Republican Party \"held out to the people that a Democratic victory meant a restoration of the \"rebels\" to power, and the dunces who heard this balderdash seemingly swallowed it as if it were divine inspiration.\"  Republicans knew that they would draw more support if they made it appear as if the South was once again attempting to unite against the North.

Woods wrote a letter to the Rector of the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia about reapplying to the Commissionership of Accounts.  A year earlier in June 1885, Woods, an attorney from Charlottesville, was appointed and was \"in sympathy with the political tenets of the majority of the board...and recommended by some of the professors.\"  Now, he was worried about his reappointment because he feared that it would \"be decided on political principle.\" If he was not reelected, Woods let the rector know that he understood it would be \" a direct reflection upon my efficiency as an officer or upon my political standing.\"  His own political party in the past nine months of office came into conflict with the University and he adamantly stated that he would believe it a direct reflection of his political affiliations if not reelected.  By acknowledging the influence and the consequences associated with political leanings, Woods understood that merit alone was not worth much in the corrupt world of nineteenth century politics. ","    Whether or not he received the position, Woods expressed a realistic fear of the late nineteenth century.  Corruption was rampant in the 1880s, especially in the political arena.  Political machines and party bosses abounded and the civil service was a mess of personal favors and nepotism.  In his first term as President from 1885 until 1889, Grover Cleveland worked to bring an end to such corruption.  In the wake of fraudulent Boss Tweed and in the presence of the powerfully corrupt Tammany Hall machine, Cleveland's campaign of political honesty appealed to many citizens.  These citizens voted for his morality in the election of 1884 that pitted Cleveland, a Democrat, against a bribe-accepting Republican candidate. As president, Cleveland was able to convince the Republican dominated Senate to repeal the Tenure of Office Act.  When Cleveland came into office, many inept Republicans dominated the federal bureaucracy.  He wished to replace the incompetent with the worthy.  The act dictated that the Senate had to approve dismissals and appointments.  This was problematic for Cleveland since Republicans had the majority.  Arguing that the act was unconstitutional, he got his repeal and the additional executive powers the Constitution provided.  Though he did not bring an end to corruption, Cleveland's little steps led to more significant changes in the future.","    It is no wonder that citizens like Woods would worry about the effects of political leanings when political favoritism was everywhere.  Gradually, the corruption and patronage so ubiquitous in late nineteenth and early twentieth century politics subsided, due in part to the example President Cleveland set in both of his terms.

She did not agree with the idea of slavery and wrote, \"white folks will have to pay for making slaves of the black folks, in the insurrection.\"  Mary no longer wanted to experience the routine whippings of the slaves, whom she had developed close relationships with.  She longed for a way to remove herself from the life that her family was so deeply imbedded in.   ","            Conflict between religion and slavery was not an uncommon dilemma in the slave South during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War.  Many deeply religious slave owners were even troubled by their own involvement with slavery.  Some slave owners who were particularly religious considered the institution of slavery to be evil and were often convinced that they would be going to hell.  However, Southern Christian churches often supported the idea of slavery.   Religious communities considered the institution slavery in terms of its social, political, and economic consequences as well as in terms of its ethical implications.  The majority of the religious communities, however, feared that emancipation would lead to devastating effects.   Slave owners used the views of their churches as a foundation to rationalize or justify their own involvement in slavery.  As a result, many slave owners considered slavery an economic and political issue that was beyond their control and ignored the ethical issues surrounding the institution.  Mary Boyden embodied this internal conflict which existed between her own ethical beliefs, her religion, and her family's use of slaves to bring in revenue.  This conflict proved to be a crucial weakness for many southerners fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

The best available instructors were lay people rather than clearly because they provided a less structured and less biased set of  morals and life lessons and because the lay people themselves were not associated with a specific denomination.  The presence of free education for the common people was the forerunner for the American public school system used today.

The county erupted in celebrations that lasted through the night as people rejoiced in the accomplishments, inventions, and emotions of the past one hundred years. The next morning on July 4th, although there was no planned celebration, announcements were made that encouraged people to utilize the labor free day to celebrate in gardens, parks, and public resorts in and around the city.

Some of the more influential and famous inventions that helped shape social life were the telephone, the typewriter, and the electric light. The combination of the combustion engine and the infamous Carliss Steam Engine both strongly influenced the American economy, as they aided productions and distribution of goods on plantations and in factories.

Tilden's population drew from his reputation as a reformer and his aid in the conviction of William Magear \"Boss\" Tweed, head of the corrupt Tweed ring operation, which stole millions of dollars from New York City.

Blaetterman was born and raised on a farm in Virginia during the early 1800s.  Raised on a large farm with relatives and close friends near by, Elizabeth became dear friends with a young girl named Victoria.  Upon Elizabeth's move to Maysville, Kentucky, in hopes of a more prosperous life for her family, Victoria and Elizabeth agreed they would write to one another and stay in touch over the years.  Victoria and Elizabeth had been raised with similar influences and therefore shared views on how their children should be raised.  Proper manners, religion, and an English education were a must.  As Elizabeth's children grew older, she had to take on the role of a teacher, and she strove to provide her children all the important amenities of a thorough English education. During the 1860s, when Elizabeth's eldest child was seven, the proper age to begin learning, she felt obligated to respond to the previously received letter from her dear Victoria, informing her of her lesion plans and the current \"mania for teaching\" they were experiencing in Kentucky.","  In the 1860s Families were advertising the importance of  sending children South for their \"board\" and/or education.  Elizabeth reminded Victoria, in her June 30, 1860 letter, \"that in the South our children could learn all the branches of a thorough English education.\"  In the eyes of Elizabeth and her fellow neighbors pushing this \"mania for teaching,\" an English education consisted of lessons in Greek, Latin, mathematics, French, German, music, singing, and painting. Elizabeth loved to teach and was anxious to begin teaching her two youngest children; one was not quite six and the other was two years old.  Elizabeth, however, did not like to begin teaching children until they were at least seven, so she must wait a few more years still. ","Nineteenth-century American society responded to the uncertainties of change through the idiom of gender.  In the early 1800s American found reassurance in widely shared perceptions of manhood and womanhood. According to historian Jeanne Boydston,  \"in the tenets of manhood were the promises of an orderly political life, and economic stability, and of the material welfare of the family.  The perceptions of womanhood, on the other hand, promised private morality and sentiment and the coherent transmission of culture from parent to child.\"  This \"republican\" system of polarities was a comforting way of conceiving secular society. As the principals of republicanism rose in importance, American society increasingly came to support the idea that women needed to understand clearly and embrace these values because they were responsible for passing them on to their children.  Women were fully responsible for teaching children but values and academic subjects that were not learned from helping their fathers around the farm.

He described his daily life in detail and also wrote of his attitudes towards minorities and Yankees. As a young man from a Virginia family, Mason demonstrated negative feelings towards these groups during the post-Reconstruction era. Racial discrimination persisted throughout the country but Jim Crow laws and racial segregation originated in the North and were not widespread in the Southern states before 1900.  In the fall of 1884, during his first term at school, Mason himself made discriminatory remarks or indicated discrimination toward his classmates. He wrote, \"I have a roommate now but I don't think he is much for he is a regular yank from the north... (He) talks through his nose all the time.\" Mason also remarked on the other boys going out to ogle at a gypsy camp as if its inhabitants were inhuman and described an incident involving an altercation between the white military school students and African-American boys in a neighboring town. ","            The post-Reconstruction South was a moderately integrated society. Historian C. Vann Woodward noted that conservative upper-class southerners \"believed that the Negro was inferior, but denied that...inferiors must be segregated or publicly humiliated.\" Woodward also noted that class distinctions were often more important than racial distinctions, therefore, an upper-class white southerner may have felt more favorably toward an African American than \"poor white trash.\" Woodward also discussed a South   Carolina newspaper from the 1880s, which was of the opinion that \"it is a great deal pleasanter to travel with respectable and well-behaved colored people than with unmannerly and ruffianly white men.\" These attitudes reflected the position of the Southern upper class as opposed to the Northern attitude towards racism over class-ism, to a degree, during post-Reconstruction. Mason O. Matthews and many of his classmates who came from southern families did have discriminatory attitudes towards minority groups but full blown segregation and Jim Crows laws were not inevitable in the South.

Charles' abrupt disappearance enraged his master, John C. Kerric. On November 22, 1851, Kerric wrote an impassioned letter to his friend, Robert T. Hubard, describing his unfortunate situation. Kerric explained that Charles ran away and was purchased by a plantation owner on the \"other side of the mountain.\" He questioned the legality of this man's purchase and asked Hubard to seek legal advice on the situation from a presumed lawyer and friend, Benjamin Graham. Also, Kerric sought to defend his social standing as a good master, proclaiming that he had established a decent house for his slaves and could not understand why Charles ran away.","After receiving Kerric's letter, Robert Hubard immediately initiated correspondence with lawyer Benjamin Graham. In his reply, Graham spoke first of the legal ramifications associated with the purchase of a runaway slave. Graham declared that a man's slave is his property for life, so Kerric still legally owned Charles. Graham also argued, however, that he understood why Charles had run away, explaining that Kerric was a \"cruel and harsh\" master. Even more, Graham defended the plantation owner who purchased Charles, complimenting his \"good plantation and content workers.\" Hubard relayed the lawyer's message to Kerric, and Kerric decided it would be best to sell Charles and end his trouble.","During the years preceding emancipation, planter society highly valued the ideal of paternalism. According to historian Drew Gilpin Faust, \"paternalism is the belief in a sense of stewardship, where some men are divinely appointed to be the guardians of others, justifying slavery as a positive good.\" The ideals of paternalism instructed masters to treat their slaves as a father would treat his child. Paternalism instigated a system of mutual obligation between slave and master; where slaves who were treated well were expected to act obediently. Most southern planters reasoned that in caring for slaves, in leading them out of barbarism, they were fulfilling God's will.","The correspondence between John Kerric, Robert Hubard, and lawyer Benjamin Graham illuminates many of the fundamental principles of paternalism. Drew Faust explains that paternalism was a social response to the South's obsessive fear of slave insurgency, seeking to control blacks as individuals and a race. The fear of slave insurgency, as in Kerric's situation, motivated many planters to take an interest in their slaves' well being. In the eyes of Kerric's community, his misfortune was warranted because he treated his slave harshly. The letters also illustrate that men who exercised paternalism were granted a certain level of respect. In his letter to Hubard, Kerric expressed deep fear that neighboring planters would cruelly criticize and judge him because of his slave's disappearance. Graham heightened this point by complimenting Charles' new<em> </em>master for his \"good plantation and content workers;\" insinuating that he might have been a better fit master than Kerric. Overall, paternalism provided an ideological and emotional context in terms of which individuals approached slavery and within which they legitimated their consequent social actions."],"locations":[{"id":13889,"lat":36.6763018346,"lng":-77.5590329782,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENSVILLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":4002,"title":"The Brewing Political Atmosphere of the 1850s\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-01","end_date":"1856-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the weeks leading to the United States presidential election of 1856, the future of the union seemed to hinge on the issue of slavery. <em>The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser</em>, a semi-weekly newspaper that was distributed throughout Richmond during the 1850s, published a series of articles expressing the southern Democrats' staunch opposition to federal interference in slavery. The articles captured the South's passionate desire to defeat the abolitionist Republican Party. They called upon all southerners who \"cherished the principles of their revolutionary fathers, to unite [against the Republicans].\" An article published on May 6, 1856 entitled, \"The Staunton Convention\", warned southerners to seize immediate political control, claiming that a Republican victory would lead to total destruction of the South. The article also offered advice to southern politicians, insisting that they rest all action on one unequivocal basis: the Constitution. More specifically, the article argued that the \"Union rested upon the Constitution, and that because slavery was especially embraced and regulated by the provisions of the Constitution, it could not be justly abolished.\"  ","The articles taken from the <em>Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser</em> represented the southern political position in the years preceding the Civil War.

A Democratic victory appeared to be the sole alternative to the catastrophe of disunion.

The author of the editorial aimed to inspire political support for the Democratic politician Grover Cleveland while describing the fundamental differences between the Democratic and Republican Parties of the 1890's. According to the author, Cleveland's ability to provide justice without offering paternalistic help or hindrance, coupled with his bold stance on tariff reform, made him a human embodiment of Democratic principles.","Overall, the editorial distinguished the political philosophies of the Republican and Democratic Parties preceding the American presidential election of 1892. As a whole, Republicans of the 1890s believed in using the federal government to direct economic expansion. Most felt that it was the business of the government to take complete control of the country's economic development. This activist position was illustrated in the Republicans' support of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which increased the protective tariff for American businesses. According to historian Davis Dewey, for Republicans, \"restrictive duties were no longer regarded as a temporary stage in the arduous journey toward industrial freedom, but a principle which ought to be permanently adopted.\" The McKinley Tariff was a source of great discontent for many Americans because it raised the prices of goods while lowering the wages of lower- and middle-class Americans. In contrast, Democrats of the 1890s believed \"that it was the duty of the people to take care of the government; that the just function of the government was to protect every man in his rights and allow him the freedom to achieve his density in his own way.\" The Democratic opposition to protective tariffs illustrated their anti-government attitude. According to the <em>Campaign Text Book of the Democratic Party for the Presidential Election of 1892</em>, \"Democrats firmly believed that protective tariffs favored foreigners at the expense of Americans.\" Thus, Democrats argued that the government had no right to impose such tariffs, and those that transcended this limit were essentially guilty of robbery. Clearly, the issue of protective tariffs illuminated the key differences between the free-market Democrats and protectionist Republicans."],"locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}]},{"id":4004,"title":"Reconstruction Brings Important Social Changes for Former Slaves\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/06","end_date":"12/31/06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The first great expansion in African American higher education came after the Civil War during the Reconstruction era.

Two white male adults, presumably acting as professors, stood before the African-American student body. The students were dressed in formal dress uniforms and carried a great deal of dignity in their stance. This picture served as a microcosmical representation of the post-war social reform, which marked a clear departure from the defeated ways of the antebellum slave South.","Clearly, post-war reconstruction brought important social changes to former slaves. Families that had been separated before and during the Civil War were reunited, and slave marriages were formalized through legally recognized ceremonies. Most notably, freed slaves took advantage of new opportunities for higher education.  The Freedmen's Bureau, which was established on March 3, 1865, instigated much of this education expansion. According to <em>A History of American Education</em>, the bureau's chief focuses were to provide food, medical care, help with resettlement, administer justice, manage abandoned and confiscated property, regulate labor, and establish schools for the distressed refugees of the Civil War. The Bureau helped to build over 1,000 African American schools, created teacher-training institutions, and founded and financed several black colleges.

He spent three grueling weeks balled up in a space hardly big enough for his body, fighting the cold and the rocking of the sea. Upon arrival in Boston, he was relieved, believing that he had finally become a free man. ","On May 24, 1854, fugitive slave hunter, Asa O. Butman, approached Burns on a street in Boston and accused him of stealing from a jewelry store. He subsequently arrested Burns and escorted him to a room where his former master, Charles F. Suttle, was waiting for him.  Under the authority of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, Suttle explained, Burns was being arrested and taken back into slavery. Burns' arrest sent shockwaves throughout Boston, and on May 26, a mob attacked the Boston courthouse, attempting to free Burns. They were unsuccessful in their efforts, and Anthony Burns went to trial with his freedom at stake. The judge, U.S. Commissioner Edward G.

After he had served his term, a plantation owner from Rocky Mount, North Carolina purchased him from Mr. Suttle, and they stole away shortly after, during the middle of the night. The public was completely ignorant to his whereabouts, and Burns was afraid that he might have lost any chance he might have had to achieve freedom. \"Buried thus in the obscurities of slavery, Anthony remained for some months wholly lost to the knowledge of his northern friends.\" He, however, did not have to wait long for help to arrive.  The Reverend Leonard A. Grimes, who had tried to purchase Burns after his initial arrest, had been tipped off as to the slave's situation and offered the owner 1300 dollars for Anthony's freedom.  The owner thus sold Burns, who was quickly transported back to Massachusetts where he received a hero's welcome.

Thus, all accidents were considered to be \"of human creation.\"  Luckily, accidents were rare because relatively few people traveled by rail and night travel was almost non-existent. The unfortunate thing was, however, that when someone died from a crash, it was not considered to be of much concern.  The death of livestock incited much more concern than the death of a traveler.

Brooks wrote these words in 1891, fifty-six years and 400,000,000 bushels of oysters after the beginning of commercial oyster revolution.  The natural beds of the Chesapeake were being depleted so rapidly that Brooks predicted a complete extinction of \"a free gift from bounteous nature.\"  \"Our indifference and lack of foresight, and our blind trust in our natural advantages, have brought this grand inheritance to the verge of ruin.\"  Despite this, Brooks believed that there was a solution: oyster harvesting.  \"An army\" of laborers must assemble and begin farming oysters, just as one would grow wheat or cotton. According to Brooks, \"our opportunities for rearing oysters are unparalleled in any other part of the world.\"  The seed for future economic and financial improvement had been planted.","            In 1895, James B. Baylor submitted to the governor of Virginia an idea based on the 439-page survey of the \"natural oyster beds, rocks and shoals\" that would not only revive the oyster industry but also bring significant funds to the ailing Virginia treasury.  Of the entire Chesapeake Bay, only 201,216.3 acres were considered to be natural oyster beds.  Outside of this, however, remained 400,000 acres of \"barren area\" that, under Section 2137 of the Code of Virginia, could be subdivided and rented to farmers for cultivation.  Baylor suggested a series of laws that, through the mandatory use of \"labor-saving appliances\" (acquired from states such as Maryland, which already had an established system of deep-water oyster harvesting) and the implementation of license taxes, would greatly improve the oyster industry and significantly increase state revenue.  Not only would everyone in the Commonwealth benefit from these laws, but also the success of oyster harvesting, which those in William Brooks' day feared might end, could be guaranteed for generations to come.  ","            Since these times, \"the shellfish aquaculture industry in Virginia has added significant value to the State's seafood marketplace.\"  Even today, notes the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, \"watermen continue to harvest both hard clams and oysters from the State's public resources.\"  Were it not for the efforts of the scientists of the late nineteenth century, however, the entire shellfish industry might have perished.

The tariff placed a high tax on foreign goods to stimulate domestic manufacturing, and, in turn, placed strains on the Southern economy as the British reduced their imports of cotton.  Many declared the tariff unconstitutional and thought that it infringed upon the individual states' rights.  To quell the South's angered reaction, Jackson issued the Tariff of 1832, which made some reductions on tax rates.  This did not satisfy everyone, however, and South Carolina acted against the federal government by calling a state convention.  The convention voted for nullification of the tariffs, viewing them as a threat to liberty and founding principles of the United States ","While some Southerners were appalled at the rash decision for nullification and saw the tariffs as simply an element of the democratic style of central government, many also shared feelings of resentment and frustration.  No other Southern state explicitly defended the constitutionality of South Carolina's nullification decrees; rather, many defended the states' right to judge and interpose against federal laws that they perceived to be unconstitutional.  The Western Carolinian of Salisbury, North Carolina, warned people to \"take no step to strengthen central power, but that you do all you can to sustain sinking liberty.\"  Some asserted the opinion that the North was a tyrannical majority that taxed the South for its own benefit, fearing that \"the South must take the yoke, bear it, and become slaves.\" North Carolina will \"Never\" stand to see South Carolina be \"crushed down, and, reduced to degrading vassalage\"  Many newspapers showed that the tension between the North and South was apparent and escalating in the early 1830s."],"locations":[{"id":9771,"lat":35.7371590314,"lng":-80.5230825706,"zoom":9,"place":"ROWAN, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":4012,"title":"Moral vs. Immoral: Exploring Slavery in Florida\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1849-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"He called the slave owners worse than house thieves and we laughed at the old fool for his ignorance,\" said Margaret Lynn Lewis in a 1849 letter to her son John Lewis Cochran.  As members of the planter class, the Lewis family relied on slave labor in order to maintain their farm. "," The use of slave labor in Florida was centered on King Cotton, which was essential to the prosperity of the South.  The emergence of slavery in Florida began with the development of the Georgia-Florida frontier, where most believed that slaves were property rather than human beings.  Furthermore, many Floridians feared that the Seminole Indians would threaten southern dominance over their slaves.  Floridians were very suspicious that the Seminoles allied with their slaves and planted thoughts of escape in their minds.  Having forced the Seminoles into the interior swampland of Florida during the Seminole Wars, the United States never extracted this community and eventually handed reserve territory over to the tribe.  Thus, the Seminoles of Florida became a combination of runaway African slaves, indigenous people, and impoverished people from various cultures following the United States' displacement and extermination of their traditional culture. ","Against the current treatment of the slaves, the anti-slavery movement opposed many, if not all, concepts of the southern outlook on slavery.  Despite this, the anti-slavery movement did take hold in parts of the South. A select few accepted the belief that slavery was immoral and should be abolished.  Holding beliefs contrary to those of their southern counterparts, some abolitionists were tried and imprisoned for such \"radical\" thoughts concerning slavery.  In the 1849 letter, Margaret told her son of one man who had been imprisoned in Jamaica for \"exciting the negroes to rebellion.\"  Such a strict punishment for the opposition of slavery illustrated the use of slavery as a crutch that steadied the South, both economically and socially, before the Civil War.

Following the cigar manufacturers' strike in Key  West that same year, Florida was forced to recognize cigars as a major agricultural product.  The opportunities that the cigar industry offered, as well as the profits, made cigar factories in Florida as valuable as tobacco plantations in colonial Jamestown.  In <em>Old South, New South</em>, Gavin Wright contends that \"the interest in keeping the southern labor market isolated disappeared after the Civil War, giving the forces that sought to promote industrial development the upper hand, and tending to integrate the southern labor market into the national one.\"  Such integration of the southern economy into the northern economy after the Civil War explains the success of cigar factories and why they became so significant to southern economy in the nineteenth century. ","As stated by Wright, the \"New South's\" dependence on industrialization forced cigar manufacturers to look elsewhere for employment after the 1890 strike in Key West.  They shifted their focus from Key West to cities like Tampa, Punta Gorda, and Charlotte  Harbor in hopes of gaining access to more job opportunities.  ","The shift in the focus of the cigar factories caused the surrounding cities to set their sights on securing lands for the cigar industry.  The article urged each town to secure at least one or two factories.  Key West launched this local project in order to draw attention to the new direction that the state was pursuing in regards to the growing cigar industry.  The large-scale manufacturing activities of the cigar industry in Florida made cigars a very important financial resource.  ","Paula Harper, associate professor at the University of Miami, traced the beginnings of the booming cigar industry to the \"exodus\" of Cubans into Key West near the start of the nineteenth century.  From there, the cigar industry became extremely pivotal in the economic, social, and political aspects of nineteenth century Florida.  This continued to be a trend until the mid-twentieth century, when cigar consumption severely declined.  The successful industrial transition from the \"Old South\" to the \"New South\" can be explained by the success of industries like cigar manufacturing.  Such an explanation allowed the \"most backward and impoverished section of the United States\" to equal the productivity of its northern counterpart."],"locations":[{"id":1432,"lat":24.6544423073,"lng":-81.6949104117,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}]},{"id":4014,"title":"A Democratic Division: Florida and the 1860 Presidential Election\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-04-09","end_date":"1860-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With the Election of 1860 just months away, the Democratic Party in Florida began working on its strategy to defeat the Republicans.  Hoping to gain momentum before the upcoming election, Florida began appointing officials to represent the Democratic Party in the late spring of 1860.  Delegated wanted to insure that democratic values were integrated into the current federal government, so Florida delegates met in Tallahassee and discussed representation at the Charleston Convention.  Each county of Florida was present, and participating counties included: Walton, Jackson, Madison, Duval, Dade, Hillsborough, Monroe, Franklin, Calhoun, Liberty, Gadsden, Leon, Wakulla, Jefferson, Alachua, and Columbia.  At the preliminary convention, the delegates also discussed how each county would be represented and determined that the ratio of voters that each county was entitled would be based on its size.","After a motion from the Honorable T.J. Eppes, the committee elected delegates to permanent offices.  Organization and a system of order were critical to the delegates at the Tallahassee Convention.  Thus, they decided to run their body with the same rules as the House of Representatives.  ","While the Democratic Convention gained support from the Southern states, the Republican Party worked on its own presidential ticket.  The Republican Party boasted an platform against the expansion of slavery led by Abraham Lincoln in its 1860 convention.  Growing animosity towards the North caused numerous tensions within the Democratic Party of the South.  Suspicions and \"mutual mistrust\" arose towards Lincoln and his platform and in the 1860 election no Florida voters cast a vote for the Republican candidate.  However, the splintered Democratic Party was too weak to compete with Lincoln on the national level.  In his book, <em>The Slave States in the Presidential Election,</em> Ollinger Crenshaw points out that the South never had a chance to rival the Republicans because of the \"defeatist\" attitude at Charleston.  Furthermore, with \"...no concerted plan of action, no well organized strategy...the election was lost [for the Democrats] in the initial cleavage at Charleston.\"  Never able to recover from this division, the Southern Democrats failed to triumph over the Republicans, thus allowing Lincoln to become the sixteenth U.S. president in 1860.  ","It was only a matter of time before Floridians felt that their demand for representation at the preliminary convention in Tallahassee was not met by Lincoln and his Republican party on the national level.  Thus, shortly after Lincoln's election in 1860, Florida followed the rest of the South and discussed secession.  Finally, on January 10,1861, Florida seceded from the Union and joined the other southern states in forming the Confederate States of America.

In reality, of course, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia remained in Virginia, but was trying to reach North Carolina after abandoning Richmond on April 2. A gloomy sentiment laid beneath the description of Lee's retreat as \"highly detrimental to the discipline of the force which has the final destiny of the Confederacy in its keeping.\" Lee's troops were backed into the state of Virginia and essentially surrounded by the forces of General Grant and General Sherman. Here the paper rallied that Lee would need to \"fight out the last battle of the rebellion or to ignominiously surrender.\" However, the paper seemed to acknowledge and allude to a certain valor in General Lee by claiming that he recognized \"the impossibility of achieving the independence of the Confederacy by the sword.\" With this comment, it seemed as if the people of the South recognized that they would fall under the weight of the Union army but that they would fall with dignity and pride.","    In the final days of the war, the citizens of the Confederacy were aware that their days were numbered and that they could not hold out against Union forces for much longer. Only two days after this article was published, Robert E.

Though many Southerners entered the war with the desire to see the Confederacy prosper as an independent nation, by April 1865, they were willing to accept defeat if it meant that they would be able to put their lives back together.

In the ad, Andrews discussed his willingness to negotiate with Virginians who wished to \"send their Negroes to Texas, in farming there, from one to ten years... and divide the net profits on just and equitable proportions.\" It seemed as if Andrews was attempting to start some type of business or partnership with slave owners in Virginia, and the tone of his writing alluded to the idea that his plan was one that had been implemented and been successful among other agricultural entrepreneurs. Andrews' proposition illustrated the desire of those residing in the new frontier lands of the Southwest to make both slavery and agriculture profitable in an area that many people hoped would become the new South. Just as it seems that John Andrews had done, in the years following Thomas Jefferson's acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, many Americans began moving west into the frontier in hopes of gaining more land as well as finding the agricultural success that many plantation owners had found in the American South. Settlers began stretching across the midwestern section of the United States into areas such as Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. Although many do not generally associate slavery with the Lone Star state, it was a very large institution in the region. In the 1850s, the proportion of slaveholders to slaves in Texas was comparable to that in Virginia, the oldest slave state in the Union."," As early as 1833 people were beginning to see Texas as a potential slave state when Stephen F. Austin claimed that \"Texas must be slave country. Circumstances and unavoidable necessity compels it. It is the wish of the people there, and it is my duty to do all I can, prudently in favor of it. I will do so.\" In the early 1840s, people began to realize that Texas served as a great source of rich soil for farming and attracted the attention of upper South slaveholders such as Andrews. As the years went on, it became evident that slavery was going to be a very large part of the growth and prosperity in the new state. It was this fact, and this connection to the South through the peculiar institution of slavery, that would solidify Texas' allegiance as the nation began to rush towards the Civil War."],"locations":[{"id":12836,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":4020,"title":"Southern Marriage\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1811-08-22","end_date":"1811-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Benjamin Rawlings prepared eagerly for his wedding day.

Several passersby overlooked her until Barclay introduced a group of rowdy schoolboys. Most of the boys were too excited about the fresh snow to notice the old woman, but one boy walked over to help her.

Compiled by Stuart McD. Farrar, the census polled residents of the county on June 30, 1850 and organized the data by household. Each household was numbered and every person who lived in the house was included within the family. Each family had to report every person who lived in the house as well as their gender, age, and place of birth. Additionally, the census reported the value of each estate, occupation of the residents, and the number of slaves on each farm. ","    The information that illustrated what kind of citizens owned slaves revealed much about the social hierarchy of Appomattox County. While most household heads reported their main occupation as either laborer or farmer, very few concluded that they owned more than one slave. In fact, those households that owned at least fifty slaves or more typically reported an additional primary occupation, such as the Flood family, where Henry D. Flood, the head of the family, was an attorney. Additionally, very few masters who owned at least fifty slaves were under the age of fifty. Most families were incredibly young, such as Major and Jettrina Powell, both under age twenty-five. The Powells owned no slaves and resided in Appomattox County as a family starting their new life together.  ","    It is clear from the census that Appomattox County, unlike certain areas of Virginia, was a region of developing infrastructure. While the central Virginia town of Lynchburg had one of the most successful regional tobacco markets, western counties like Appomattox were more focused on self-sufficient farming. Several farms grew tobacco in order to earn more income, but few farmers made a large profit. Competition with the wealthier Virginia counties that produced cash crops was not possible, and so the area was mostly home to families who had established themselves as yeoman farmers.

Eli Thayer for the free white recolonization of Old Virginia has revived the agitation of a great question which will never be stopped until the old State is revolutionized, repopulated, and restored to something of her ancient glory in the Union.\"  Indeed, Eli Thayer and his Homestead Emigration Company had, since his tour of western Virginia in 1856, eyed this region as potential land for his settlement of free, non-slaveholding whites.  Thayer was thus attempting to carry out his \"Plan of Freedom.\"  The newspaper had discovered that \"landowners of Virginia have offered over five million of acres to Eli Thayer, 'as cheap as dirt,' for cash.\" ","            Amongst this, Thayer could have relied upon several other sources of encouragement for his new colony.  The Mormon settlements in Illinois and Impresarios in Texas both demonstrated the successes of mass movements.  The migration of white settlers to western Virginia was not a novel exploit.  In Upshur County, New England farmers and stockmen had already settled the French Creek community in the early nineteenth century.  Thayer's own partner, John C. Underwood, had migrated from New York to a Clarke County dairy farm where he prosperously hired only free labor.","            Thayer and Underwood preferred to enable a large migration that could provide sufficient internal discipline to withstand pressures to \"become orthodox on the slavery question.\"  They wanted to provide a \"test of cultures\" so that free labor would promote the eradication of slavery.  Both Underwood and Thayer privately predicted that economic prosperity in a free labor society would show that unlike slaves, free laborers \"neither malinger, nor intentionally misunderstand, neither 'run away' nor 'steal ham and chickens.'\"  Underwood conceded that white migrants would push 'perhaps inferior' blacks from the Upper South to the \"cursed Lower South.\"  He wrote that because of slavery's \"injurious effects to the white race\" that Virginia should be \"deAfricanized & settled by white men with all the energy, love of Freedom, order, & education characterizing the Anglo-Saxon Race.\"","            The <em>New York Herald</em>, Thayer believed, would be essential to his success, because it had a large circulation within the slave states and its editor avoided \"inflammatory pronouncements on the slavery issue.\"  The paper clearly states its support for Thayer: \"Eli Thayer is now about trying the experiment of waking up the old State to her senses.  Depleted, poor, and crippled with debts, she is now in a good frame of mind for the application of the remedies of common sense.\"  Other papers, such as the <em>Wellsburg Herald</em>, expressed convictions that the people of western Virginia would accept the introduction of free labor.  Thus in the fall of 1857, Thayer established and began physical development of an industrial town in Wayne County where white New England emigrants worked as free laborers.  He named it Ceredo, after the Roman goddess of agricultural fertility, Ceres.  ","            The experiment would eventually fail when money came into short supply from national economic depression and the inability of some investors in Thayer and Underwood's company to contribute.  Both men had certainly \"tried the question,\" but never truly posed any threat to the Southern slave system.  Yet, as historian William Freehling noted, Thayer and Underwood emphasized that the buying, selling, and working of land, not the buying, selling, and working of slaves fueled most economic interests in the Upper South.  By introducing southern upper class land sellers to northern middle-class land buyers, Underwood and Thayer's company attempted to boost the economy.  Underwood once promised to a western Virginia entrepreneur that \"my northerners will double the value of your lands, make your neglected hillsides bloom with cultivation\" lead \"your hitherto neglected waterpower\" to ring \"with the music of the wheel,...and cause your desert to bloom like a rose.\""],"locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}]},{"id":4028,"title":"The Runaway Daniel\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-02","end_date":"1856-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Friday, May 2, 1856, an ad was put out in the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> from a subscriber living near Upper Marlboro', Prince George's county (Md), offered a 100 reward for the return of a \"run away.\" On the \"4th of April, Negro boy Daniel\" ran away from his master to, the master believed, Washington City. Daniel's master, J. Berry, understood that \"he is hired in Washington City by his free relatives, or he may be at some of the fisheries.\" An extremely detailed description of Daniel followed stating that he was \"about 16 years of age, 5 feet high, very bright mulatto, slender made and delicate features, high cheek bones, long bushy hair, and light eyes.\" Such a description, his master thought, would ensure that he would \"get him again.\" ","Federal law and the United States Constitution required the return of runaway slaves. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was hardly enforced and northerners did not help in retrieving runaways. Because of this the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 made any official who did not detain a slave accountable to a fine, and officials had a duty to arrest suspected runaways. This law hit a blow to abolitionists, who protested it. Berry's decision to solicit the help of the readers of the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> could indicate northern resentment of the new Fugitive Slave Law. Berry could not trust that his slave would be returned by federal law alone and hoped to receive greater aid in his slave's capture.","Runaway slaves reduced productivity, cost their masters money (in rewards as well as other fees such as detaining the slave), and took away their masters' time.

Interestingly, the price for the capture of Daniel was only 100 dollars if caught out of state but would drop to 50 dollars in the District of Columbia and further to 25 dollars if caught in the master's county.

Bond wrote regularly about her faith and how the \"Lord [will] direct our ways and grant we may follow them.\" Although a Maryland native, Bond moved to Louisiana in 1861 because of her husband Howard Bond's service in the Confederate Army. His departure invoked many of the religious passages in her diary as she used religion as a comfort and a way to calm her fears. Bond often prayed to God in that she \"may not be entirely cut off from [her] husband,\" and that \"the cruel enemy may be driven from our soil.\" Her prayers to \"put a stop shortly to this miserable war\" were her comfort, and God, she believed, would answer those prayers.  Religious belief was how Bond coped, and she held her beliefs close. Even through illness, which was common throughout her diary, Bond remained religious.  Sickness fell to Bond and almost all around her but she \"believe[d] [she was] perfectly resigned to God's Will...as though He will spare [her]...but if it is God's wish to take [her], He knows best.\" ","The effects of the Second Great Awakening could still be seen 30 years later.

Evangelicals believed that the Bible was their guide and their actions must follow the Bible. In Bond's case, she strongly believed in the teachings of the Bible and believed that her prayers would be answered. According to Miller, \"Americans believed God was on the side of those who were right with Him,\" and Bond believed he was with her.  In order to live a good life, Protestants like Bond tried their best to follow the teachings of their savior. Prayer was her salvation from the horrors of war and illness, and she believed God would reward her in the afterlife. On August 34, 1863, Bond prayed, \"Oh, I do pray the good Lord will grant me this prayer-that I once more may visit the place of my nativity.\" She arrived home, in Maryland on January 2, 1866 and died shortly after.

The bill he discussed (H.R. 3022) determined appropriations for improvements to the Kanawha River and its tributaries, the Elk River and the New River, the Big Sandy River, and the Monongahela River.  He believed that such improvements would allow the state to capitalize on its natural resources, which had previously been isolated from market contact due in part to inadequate transportation facilities.  ","Though the wealth that existed in West Virginia's fertile lands was publicly known, no significant effort was made to \"realize its commercial value.\"  With the growth of settlement in the antebellum years, transportation along roads and waterways became a critical concern for isolated western Virginians.  Rivers and streams, however, proved difficult to navigate due to low water levels in summer, ice in winter, and year-round flooding.  Nevertheless, inland routes such as the Ohio River carried more coal than any other product.  ","Out of the many coal-producing states, western Virginia was one of two that was in a position to take advantage of markets both along the coast and along the interior.  Yet, because it had not developed channels for the distribution of coal by neither canal nor railroad, West Virginia's Kanawha coal fields had outlet only through the Kanawha River.  The Kanawha Company attempted to keep the river clear of rocks and snags, yet it had not made the improvements necessary to permit uninterrupted shipments of coal to the Ohio River.","Faulkner recognized the statements of Mr. Bell, president of the Iron and Steel Institute, the London Daily Advertiser and the British Quarterly, which spoke of the decline of British iron and coal empires.  He noted their claims that the United States would become the only nation that could supply the world's demand for coal and iron.  Faulkner illuminated his belief that West Virginia could satisfy these growing international demands.  He stated, \"doubtless there are many sections of the Union from which large contributions can be made; but where upon this continent is the coal and iron region to be found that can justly compare with West Virginia?  Where is the state or country that in the variety, richness, and manufacturing quality of its coal can rival those wonderful deposits, which are comprehended in our sixteen thousand square miles of exhaustless wealth?\"  ","  Though West Virginia had never before been a dominant supplier of coal, the improvements that Faulkner eagerly supported would finally allow the coal industry in the Kanawha region to become a chief factor in the state's economy.  Only then could the West Virginia coal industry claim its share of competition in the nation's coal market.  As Faulkner asserted, \"for heavy articles like iron and coal no mode of transportation can compare in cheapness to that of water, and when, under the benign auspices  of this Government, our rivers shall be cleared of their obstructions and made capable of floating upon their surface our rich products to market, we shall bid defiance to competition and feel that we are prepared \"to stand up against a world in arms.\"  "],"locations":[{"id":14656,"lat":38.3365622006,"lng":-81.528129492,"zoom":9,"place":"KANAWHA, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}]},{"id":4031,"title":"Gradual Abolition of Slavery in Western Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-09-01","end_date":"1847-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1831, the issue of slavery came to the forefront of political debate following Nat Turner's rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia.  President of Washington College and slaveholder Dr. Henry Ruffner delivered an address in 1847 that outlined the evils of slavery and proposed the gradual eradication of slavery from western Virginia.  In correspondence to Messrs. Moore, Letcher, &c, Ruffner wrote, \"as we are nearly all slaveholders, and none of us approve of the principles and measures of the sect of abolitionists, we think that no man can be offended with us for offering to the people an argument whose sole object is to show that the prosperity of our West Virginia-if not East Virginia also,--would be promoted by removing gradually the institution of slavery, in a manner consistent with the rights and interests of slaveholders.\"  He delivered this speech first to the Franklin Literary Society of Lexington, Virginia, at the close of debates on the division of the state of Virginia.  Ruffner afterwards compiled his emancipation argument into the \"Ruffner pamphlet,\" which made its debut in September 1847.  Throughout his speech, Ruffner rejected the extremes of both abolitionism and pro-slavery extremism, claiming the \"middle way.\"","Unlike the abolitionists, who objected to slavery on moral grounds, Ruffner objected to the economic problems that slavery created.  His protest matched that of trans-Allegheny legislators who called slavery the sure route to economic stagnation.  In western counties, such as the Kanawha Valley, where Ruffner spent his childhood, slavery was not profitable and often took jobs from white laborers.  He argued that, \"our own West Virginia furnishes conclusive evidence, that slavery....has a pernicious influence on the public welfare.\"  Most people in western Virginia engaged in livestock and small farming operations where slavery was not economical.  Industries, such as the Kanawha salt industry, leased and hired slaves, often from eastern Virginia, for lower wages than white laborers demanded.  Any such encouragement to the growth of slave population west of the Blue Ridge, Ruffner felt, was dangerous to the free labor population.  He compared the slave states with free states to provide concrete examples of his logic-\"In the older free states are seen all tokens of prosperity....  In the older parts of the slave states, -with a few local exceptions,-are seen, on the contrary, too evident signs of stagnation or of positive decay....\"  Thus, as Ruffner reasoned, the institution of slavery would not allow the western Virginian economy to prosper.  It was on this basis that Ruffner placed his overall argument.","Ruffner united his discussion of slavery with the \"white basis\" for representation in the legislature, asserting that the two were intertwined.  Representation in the Virginia General Assembly favored eastern Virginia over its western counterpart due to the imbalance of slave populations.  Indeed, western politicians were bitter against east Virginia for using their power to retain the mixed basis of representation and to deny to western Virginia its rights.  Ruffner's argument was coherent with the general sentiments of westerners at the time who attacked both the practice of unequal representation and the institution of slavery.  In them, they saw the sole causes of their political degradation and of their arrested social and economic development.  Historian Charles Ambler noted that \"arguments opposing and supporting these two extremes were poured forth in profusion in the Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 and in the assembly of 1831-1832, where the expediency of legislating upon the abolition of negro slavery was the chief subject of discussion.\"  Ruffner reminded his audience of the measure introduced in Virginia's legislature proposing gradual emancipation:  \"and so the people of West Virginia then thought, for they were generally and warmly in favor of it, and zealously advocated it through their able and patriotic Delegates.  But in spite of their efforts, it was rejected by the all powerful Eastern majority, though several Eastern delegates joined the West in its support.\" ","In the conclusion of his argument for the necessity of action to remove the institution of slavery from West Virginia, Ruffner outlined a scheme for such a removal with six major components.  He proposed foremost that further importation of slaves be prohibited and that the exportation of slaves be freely permitted (with the exception that children of slaves born after a certain day, not be exported after they had reached five years of age).  Next, he advised that the existing generation of slaves remain in their present condition (but that their offspring born after a certain day should be emancipated at no later than 25 years of age).  Furthermore, Ruffner felt that masters should be required to teach the \"heirs of emancipation\" reading, writing and arithmetic, that the emancipated slaves be colonized, and finally, that the law allow any county to decree the removal or emancipation of all slaves of the county within a certain term of years.  ","  It was not until eighteen months after Ruffner's death, when the Union admitted West Virginia as a legal state, that its constitution provided for a gradual emancipation plan similar to the system proposed by Ruffner.  The legal emancipation of slaves in West Virginia did not take place until February 3, 1865, when the governor approved an act abolishing slavery, providing for the immediate emancipation of all slaves.  They had finally taken the course of action that Ruffner had called for--\"Now fellow citizens, it is for you to determine whether the slavery question shall be considered, discussed and decided, at this critical, this turning point of your country's history...may heaven direct your minds to the course dictated by patriotism, by humanity and by your own true interest.\"  "],"locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":4032,"title":"Radicalism vs. Rationality\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-15","end_date":"1832-12-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On Saturday, December 15, 1832, the <em>Virginia Herald</em> expressed its grief over the Nullification Crisis with the words, \"alarming as the crisis...is, we cling to the hope, that for the sake of humanity and the honor of our country and her institutions, that means of averting the impending storm may yet be devised...\" While regretting the approaching conflict, the Virginia newspaper never showed support for the doctrine of nullification. Instead, the publication printed both South Carolina and President Jackson's addresses, presenting both sides of the issue. Although it expressed its belief in the sanctity of the Constitution, the newspaper never alluded to whether it approved more of Jackson or South Carolina's constitutional theory. Virginia, like several other Southern states, often struggled to reconcile her beliefs in state sovereignty and in preservation of the Union. However, fearing the damage a military confrontation would cause, the paper expressed desperate desire for compromise stating, \"In common with our countrymen, we shall consider civil bloodshed as to be the most direful calamity that can possibly befall this free and happy land.\"  "," Early in President Jackson's administration, Congress passed the protective tariff of 1828, which quickly came to be known to the South as the \"Tariff of Abominations.\" The tariff intended to protect Northern industry from competing European goods by placing a higher tax on such products. Cotton planters felt the tariff explicitly alienated them because it made their cost of living more expensive and greatly diminished Great Britain's cotton imports. Although the tariff was abrasive to all Southern states, under the leadership of Vice President and states' rights champion, John C. Calhoun, South Carolina led the rally against it. Calling the tariff unconstitutional because it failed to promote the general welfare, Calhoun called for nullification, a doctrine that allowed states to void federal legislation if it breached the constitutional contract made between the states and the federal government. Taking an immediate stand against nullification President Jackson exclaimed, \"...the power to annul a law ... is incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the...Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive for the great object for which it was formed.\" "," At the start of the crisis, most Southern states shared South Carolina's hatred of the tariff, but never quite embraced the radicalism of nullification. The attitude the <em>Virginia Herald</em> took in December 1832 was characteristic of the rest Southern states' feelings about the crisis. These states relied on their representatives in Congress to rectify the tariff issue instead of taking matters into their own hands.  While they were ardent supporters of states' rights, most were unwilling to risk bloodshed, or worse, separation from the Union in favor of nullification. Most Southern states viewed this method as Alabama's legislature did, \"unsound in theory, and dangerous in practise.\" Instead, the majority of the South favored a logical compromise to the sectional controversy. Nevertheless, December 1832 marked a volatile month in politics, giving birth to unprecedented radicalism, thus stimulating a call for Southern rationality.

Bramlette agreed that the \"evil necessity\" had become an \"incumbus upon our energies, a burden to our advancement, and a negative to our prosperity.\" ","As a border state, Kentucky lacked the labor-intensive staple crops, such as cotton and tobacco, that were necessary to support slavery, and the average size of slaveholdings in Kentucky was the fourth smallest in the South.  With a long history in the antebellum years of moderation and compromise, Kentucky provided an atmosphere conducive to antislavery advocates.  However, even such advocates lacked a willingness to take firm action.  Most believed that slavery was a necessary instrument for controlling the state's black population.  During the war, Kentucky became firmly committed to the Union yet remained governed by a coalition opposing all policies that challenged slavery.  State officials denounced the Emancipation Proclamation as unconstitutional and refused to recognize the liberty of any black person claiming or pretending to be free.  It is this very resistance that General Brisbin so ardently disfavored in his letter: \"slavery is at an end, and why deny it, or, by withholding proper State legislation, seek to retain longer the shadow of an institution that was always worthless?\"","Brisbin advanced his argument by describing the condition of slavery and labor in Kentucky.  He wrote, \"the master can no longer hold his slaves or depend on their labor for a single day, so that producers cannot calculate their crops or pursue agriculture with any degree of certainty.\"  Indeed, the war undermined the exclusive authority of master over slave.  Slaves quickly learned that authority and protection resided with the Union army when unionist slaveholders could not protect their slaves against Confederate invaders.  Conversely, when federal military lines moved into areas previously held by Confederate forces, slaveholders who had sympathized with the Southern army fled, leaving property and slaves behind.  Most of these abandoned slaves immediately assumed the stance of free blacks.","By December 1862, Kentucky slaves were moving in such numbers that it became impossible to exercise control over them.  Brisbin related this occurrence: \"having become restless or dissatisfied, the slaves leave their homes, and setting their faces toward Louisville, journey for days over long miles to these headquarters, as the Mecca where freedom may be found....\"  By this time, it had become common for Kentucky slaves to ask for wages in return for their labor.  When denied, slaves often fled the plantation.  ","Over time, slaves had begun to make personal decisions without regard for the authority of the slaveholder.  Another popular movement of slaves was the enlistment of black men and boys into the army.  These enlisted slaves became freedmen, a circumstance that in itself weakened the institution of servitude in Kentucky.  Brisbin also noted that \"Negro enlistment has bankrupted slavery in Kentucky, over 22,000 of the most valuable slaves having gone into the service.\"  Indeed, by war's end, Kentucky had mustered 23,703 blacks into federal service.  ","The departure of slaves from Kentucky to the Northeast as wage earners, movement of blacks to towns and cities, and enlistment of the Kentucky slaves in military service all combined to create an acute labor shortage in Kentucky by 1865.  Indeed, Brisbin reasoned, \"Kentucky needs what black labor she has left to till the soil, and her slaves can now be of more service to the nation in the corn fields than in the army....\"  He concluded his letter by proposing that freeing the slaves in \"one blow\" would end the questionable status of labor in Kentucky.  Brisbin wrote, \"the sooner Kentucky makes up her mind and accepts the new order of things, and to establish labor upon a free, paid basis, the better it will be for her.\"","Though the formal emancipation of slaves in Kentucky did not take effect until the United States adopted the Thirteenth Amendment, it had ceased to be a \"viable institution\" long before then.  It had suffered such afflictions that left no hope for its reestablishment as it had existed before war.  Still, slavery had been more deeply entrenched in Kentucky than elsewhere in the border region.  At war's end, more than sixty-five thousand slaves remained in bondage, and it would take decades of further persistence for Kentucky to embrace racial equality."],"locations":[{"id":4979,"lat":38.1872796075,"lng":-85.6593965884,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":4034,"title":"Defending Honor---Ready, Aim, Fire","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-06-08","end_date":"1880-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            Dissatisfied with local politics, editor of the Richmond <em>Whig</em> and secretary of the Virginia Commonwealth, William C.

Upon reading Elam's critical political commentary, Ex-Governor William \"Extra Billy\" Smith became outraged, receiving the article as a personal attack.  Much too old to defend his honor physically, Smith employed his young son to do his bidding. Young Smith and Elam agreed to settle the quarrel with a duel at the Mordecai-McCarty ground near the eastern suburbs of Richmond, Virginia. Smith, Elam, and their seconds met at their destination and took their positions ten paces away from each other. At the sound of the word, each man fired his pistol, aiming it directly at his opponent. Elam immediately collapsed. Smith's shot nailed him directly in the chin, smashing his teeth and shattering his left jaw. Upon Elam's fall, Smith rushed forward to shake hands and to express regret for their need to meet. Like a true gentleman, Elam weakly replied that he was incredibly relieved that it was he who had been injured instead of Smith. ","            Few things mattered more to Southern men than honor. Grounded in masculinity, hierarchy, and outward appearance, honor encouraged highly emotional reactions to conflict. Since the seventeenth century, Southerners had commonly used violence to solve personal quarrels. Dueling, however, did not become popular until the 1770s when French and English military officers made it the trend in the American army. It quickly became fashionable to defend one's honor by dueling because it \"constituted not merely a pseudo-aristocratic affectation, but the most rationalized manifestation of a set of values.\" Southern politicians, like Governor William Smith, made use of this tactic whenever aggravated by insult or slander. ","As time went on, Southern honor culture increasingly came into conflict with the law. For obvious reasons, killing a man for his opinions was illegal. Thus, by the end of the Civil War the number of duels had significantly diminished.  Nevertheless, Southerners continued to equate honor with self-respect, and if someone violated another's honor, the perpetrator could expect bloodshed to occur.

The <em>Virginian </em>delivered the result of the vote, gave no commentary on the issue, and immediately resumed discussion of the public buildings' appropriation."," In 1887, Southern men still retained the idea that it was their duty to protect women's virtue, one of the most significant aspects of the prevailing honor culture. Men saw politics as too intense for ladies to concern themselves with, for it often embodied corruption and uncensored dialogue. Women were the ethical compass in Southern households, thus many men thought involvement in politics would not only taint their image, but their moral fiber as well. Furthermore, as Horace Bushnell points out, men commonly held the belief that women were incapable of making sound decisions when voting because they went \"more by feeling than men, they feel every thing more intensely, and with more liabilities to excess.\" ","It was also still common for many families to ascribe to traditional gender roles of the antebellum period. Nicholas Bromell's book, <em>By the Sweat of the Brow</em>, also notes that men were usually the primary providers while women occupied their own \"sphere,\" remaining in the home to be the family's religious authority and caretaker. Thus, at the time there was no place for women in politics because the defining characteristic of their \"sphere\" was that it made a clear distinction between \"home and world.\" The cult of domesticity continued to have a heavy influence on Southern life in the 1880s, therefore delaying women's right to vote. "," The <em>Virginian Weekly & Carolinian's </em>apathetic attitude towards women's suffrage was synonymous with the majority of Southern male ideas on the issue. Things like internal improvements and government funding were much higher priorities at the time. Men were not ready to conflate the gender spheres and include women in self-government because they saw them unfit to do its bidding. The voting booth was a male arena; women were the spectators.

At the beginning of the war, it was important to build up the troops for their initial engagements with the Union Army, expressed by supporters as the need to wake from a dream-like state.  In the song <em>North Carolina: A Call to Arms,</em> the author called for the \"sons of Carolina...to wake from [their] dreaming,\" and insisted that they could not procrastinate as the \"minions of Lincoln\" streamed down upon them.  The author mentions that the soldiers needed to be prepared to \"meet at the onset [that] treacherous invasion\" from the North, and said that their families and loved ones depended on them for protection.  The author went on to say that if they did not act quickly and did not repel the Union soldiers that their loved ones would perish at the swords of \"they [that] thirst for the life-blood of those...most cherish[ed].\"","Encouraging the troops during the Civil War was necessary.  Appeals to the honor of soldiers and their need to protect their families and lifestyles were essential methods to ensure that a useful and functional army would be available to fight the war.  According to <em>The Life of Johnny Reb</em>, soldiers received instruction in battlefield tactics and behavior, everything from \"pick[ing] off the enemy's officers\" to orders to \"not be terrorized\" and warnings that \"cowards [would] be shot.\"  They were led into battle behind drums, put into position, and finally told to march, which then caused the line to \"leap forward with the famous 'Rebel yell.'\"  The Union soldiers were classified as evil and the thought of them hurting Confederate soldiers' loved ones ensured that soldiers would hold the lines.  Reports from colonels and generals of battles did not include much about soldiers who deserted or retreated from battle; instead, most of the reports idolized the heroics of the soldiers as a unit, and showed their solidarity and cohesion in the face of a brutal war.  Encouragement for the war was necessary for Confederate troops with all of the horrors that come along with war.  Dissent was looked down upon and rarely reported to ensure that it would not spread through the ranks and cause an internal collapse.  The honor of soldiers and the appeals of loved ones were used to motivate the soldiers to protect their homes and fight, instead of retreating and letting the Union kill their loved ones."],"locations":[{"id":9844,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":4038,"title":"The Racism of Reconstruction\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-04-01","end_date":"1877-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The period of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War saw a fluctuation of freedoms for African Americans in the former Confederate South.

As this happened, the \"violence had a profound effect on Reconstruction politics\" and produced a \"demoralizing impact upon [the African American] communities.\"  As the violence towards African Americans increased in the South, they became much less likely to not take the opportunity to vote or run in elections, which further destabilized the basic foundation of power that had just been established with the beginning of Reconstruction.

In the Raleigh<em> Register</em> the attack on Sumner was characterized as necessary to preserve the dignity of the Senate \"in order to command the respect of the public.\"  Yet at the same time, criticism in the <em>Daily Herald</em>, another newspaper in North Carolina, showed that all Southerners did not support Brooks's actions because they gave more momentum to the \"freesoilers\" of the North.

It was proof that his business relations with an associate, William Tompkins, Sr., had finally bore fruit.  Mr. Tompkins waited over three years to pay James Brady for debts dating back to May 1829.  The large quantities of bacon, corn, nails, and planks had accumulated into a bill of 65.61, no small sum.  Brady let out a sigh of relief.  With this money he could expand his investments into the booming slave trade, which was far more lucrative than five hundred nails at 4.37.  James Brady became a fairly active slave trader, handling not a few transactions in the 1840s and 1850s, due to diligent effort but also to exterior factors. ","With the acquisition of lands of the southwestern frontier from the Creek Indians, Mississippi and Alabama were states by 1819, expanding the influence of the Slave South.  Between this and the ability of the cotton gin to enable a profit from lesser-grade, short-staple Southern cotton rose to the nation's top cash crop by 1830.  Due to the increase in demand for labor and no legal slave importation, deep Southern planters turned to Maryland and Virginia to supply labor.  Merchants like James Brady came into the picture here, buying and selling slaves for a profit on a route between Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.  According to Michael Tadman's <em>Speculators and Slaves</em>, states with large populations like Virginia exported slaves to the expanding southern cotton and (in Louisiana's case) sugar states.  When the international slave trade ended in 1807, dependence on states like Virginia grew greatly, leaving traders like James Brady in a position to turn quite a profit.  Treating black people like property, individuals such as James Brady separated children from their mothers, endearing dealers to no one North or South. ","Looking over his financial records and personal letters, James Brady was no Simon Legree, the evil slave trader from Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  James Brady kept thorough financial records and took advantage of a business opportunity.

Now, seven and a half years after Appomattox, John Adams was dead.  Sensing its approach, he filled out his will on January 8, 1873, just six days before his demise.  In his will, before laying out his possessions, he stated that he wished his debts to be paid.  Everyone immediately swooped in on John's son Joseph, the new holder of the Adams estate.  Barely a month after the loss, a mister Samuel Adams, with the leverage of a justice of the peace, forced Joseph to cover a debt of 73.50, rather paltry in light of the Adams family's wealth.

Sent away to be valued along with the rest of the Captains' property, Douglass had visions of never seeing his family or his home city of Baltimore ever again. In his memoir, he talked about how the lives of cattle and swine were viewed equally with those of African American descent. This was a common feeling shared by many other slaves at the time.

This shows how even though many slaves dreamed of freedom, the idea of being caught stopped many from taking action. The fear of what could have happened kept many African Americans enslaved during the nineteenth century. This would not be Frederick's last attempt toward freedom.","Many years after Frederick Douglass' escaped slavery he was still being sought after. In <em>The Slave Narrative</em> it talks about how even though Douglass was in the North, he still feared for his life. \"As soon as his narrative was published on the first of June, 1845, Douglass realized that it was necessary for him to leave New England for old England, because his revelation of the concrete facts of his experience in slavery had disclosed his identity, and he was at any moment thenceforth in danger of recapture.\" This shows how even after slaves became free their lives were still in jeopardy. Their lives were filled with the constant fear of what would happen if they were caught. Even though slaves faced fierce punishments if captured, there was still a chance they would become free. In many cases, the punishments diminished slaves' dreams of becoming free but some still saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

Howe to his brother John, of Enfield, Massachusetts on July 31, 1824. In meeting his brother's request, L.W. certainly provided an extensive account of the principal facets of life in the state of Virginia. Not only did he recount that the preferred beverage of the state was Whiskey, but he was mystified by the details of cooking because the process was all done in a \"separate house called a kitchen.\" What a strange concept to those hailing from the wintry climate of New England, where a trip outdoors to a separate building was absurd The most palpable aspect of Howe's letter, however, is the prominent role of agriculture and climate in central Virginian life. He noted that the \"wheat has come in very well and the prospect for corn is as good as it every was.\" Yet, when he discussed tobacco Howe displayed concern, in that \"the present prospect is promising, but it is a precarious crop.\" After he bemoaned the \"oppressive heat\" in the state, he promised his brother a copy of the Franklin Almanac when the new edition was published. In describing, \"how the Virginians live,\" the New Englander emphasized not their dress or manner, but instead the weather, soil, and crop yields that dictated planter life in the Commonwealth. ","    By the 1820s tobacco had brought wealth to Virginia for two hundred years. Throughout this time period it made its way from the Tidewater region to the Piedmont and became the central economic factor that brought wealth to the state. Howe's discussions of the climate and the Franklin Almanac were common amongst Virginians, who relied so heavily upon agriculture. The Panic of 1819, however, hit the southern states hard. Along with the plummeting of cotton rates came the decline of other agriculture products, including tobacco. Howe understood that Virginians were no longer able to depend on tobacco as a single cash crop. Aside from the concerns of the fluctuating market, tobacco itself depleted the soil and would not grow in the same area for more than three to four years. This made it significantly less profitable when the crop prices were low. According to Joseph A. CotÉ, in the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, a lack of crop diversity was a danger to the \"overall development of the South.\" Virginia farmers came to this same conclusion and shifted to other agricultural endeavors such as wheat and corn to supplant their livelihoods. As hardship became more commonplace, farmers found it necessary to provide food for their families and slaves. Wheat and corn comprised a significant portion of the crops grown throughout the state. After the economic difficulties surrounding the Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812, and most prominently the Panic of 1819, planters could no longer safely rely on the tobacco market to provide for all of their needs.

This deceptive process of marking ballots incorrectly and giving them to illiterate blacks who would have voted in a different manner became common in the early 1880s.

The economy of the South was still dependent on agriculture, however, as most of its land consisted of rural areas that needed to be farmed. Former slaves, now freedmen, were no longer bonded to harsh labor without benefits. Emancipation resulted in contracts between ex-masters and freedmen agreeing upon paid labor. In return for minimal pay and shelter, African Americans would work on land belonging to white landowners. On the land of George  C. Hannah in Charlotte County, Virginia, former slaves shared a similar experience.  On January 1, 1867, Hannah established a written agreement between himself and the freedmen he hired to work on his land.

The nine different workers on Hannah's land, some of whom had families and were formerly slaves, were expected to \"bind themselves to work diligently and faithfully, obeying all orders.\" As long as the freedmen complied fully with every rule and regulation, Hannah would pay them in proportion to their work effort and in accordance with the number of family members each had. The payments ranged from a minimum seventy-two dollars per year, awarded to a single man named Cornelius, to one hundred and sixty dollars for a family of four.

Although she wished for her cousins to visit her, Sarah warned Mary that her \"dear old state\" presented anything but a pleasing appearance at that time because of the hardships it faced.

William White wrote a narrative about African American Preachers. In it he tells the story of a black preacher known as \"Uncle Jack.\" Slave traders kidnapped Jack from Africa when he was seven years out and sold him into slavery in Nottoway, Virginia. When he was forty he heard a Presbyterian Minister from Prince Edward County preach and became religious. White wrote  that once Jack found religion he wanted to learn to read so that he could study the bible. He convinced his master's children to teach him by \"promising to reward them for their pains with nuts and other fruits, as tuition fees.\" Once he learned to read, he received his license from the Baptist church and began to preach. In Nottoway at this time there were not many churches and Jack was \"often called to preach at a distance of more than thirty miles from his home.\" Additionally Jack \" secured the respect and confidence of the white people,\" as well as the adulation of blacks, and when his master died he was able to buy his freedom thanks to donations from white members of the community. ","Uncle Jack's experience as a black preacher was not typical. Many white southerners were hostile to black preachers after 1831 because of the slave rebellion lead by Nat Turner, a slave preacher, which was responsible for the death of 57 white men, women and children.  Slave owners passed laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read or write, and encouraged slaves to attend services given by white preachers who indoctrinated them with the idea that good, hardworking slaves who respected their masters would go to heaven. ","There are several reasons why Uncle Jack might have been exempt from these restrictions. The first is that he did not fit white stereotypes about slaves, especially in terms of his speech. White wrote, \"the reader must not be surprised, therefore, that nothing occurs in what we quote from his own lips, of the jargon peculiar to the African race. Nobody ever heard the good old preacher say massa for master or me for I.\" Another reason he may have been exempt from restrictions was that he rejected typical \"slave\" style preaching. In particular \"he uniformly opposed, both in public and private, every thing like noise and disorder in the house of God. His coloured auditors were very prone to err in this way. But whenever they did, he suspended the exercises until they became silent.\" Whatever the reasons, Uncle Jack achieved something extraordinary through his religion and lived a life unlike most other slaves because of it.

It is hardly what one would expect, considering that it is about one the company that altered industry in this country perhaps more than any other.

It makes sense that a Southern newspaper would not pay much attention to an oil company because the South was not nearly as dependent on oil as the rest of the country was.

In particular, there were still a disproportionate amount of railroads in the West and North compared to the South. The attempts to remedy the disparity had been largely unsuccessful up until this point. State legislatures gave railroad subsidies to companies hoping to spur railroad development; while the subsidies did add railroad lines throughout the South, the companies also abused the subsidies, using them for other purposes. Also, the lines were owned almost exclusively by companies in the North, so their effects on the Southern economy were limited. The difference in industry between the North and South was one of the things that lead to Southern secession from the Union, and even after the states were reunited the inequality in industry still remained a problem.

Although Davis initially wished not to obtain the position of president, he treated everyone fairly and wished everyone the best. Upon making his closing remarks, he said the future was bright for the Confederates, advised people to join the army, and the people responded with a resounding ovation.

At the same time, they still felt a reverence towards the Confederacy. He wrote that James' letter shed light on recent \"discussion between two distinguished Southern generals concerning alleged delay of one of them in getting his troops into the line, at the battle.\" Houston also prefaced the letter by talking about how excited the troops were before the battle to go \"into the land of our enemy. . . Virginia our native state, was now for a time at least to be freed from the desolation and cruelties incident to the presence of an armed foe.\"  He concluded his writing by praising James because \"he did not die in battle like so many others, but for the South he gave his youth, sacrificed his health and poured his blood.\" ","    Houston demonstrated nostalgia towards the Confederacy that was typical of Southerners during this time period.

","    In the book Cities of the Dead, William Blair discusses the political and social ramifications of the continued veneration for the Confederacy. Blair suggested that Southern politicians encouraged and manipulated nostalgia about the Civil War for their own political gain due to  \"the struggles over politics and power in the postemancipation South.\" Many have claimed that reverence of the Confederate flag, reenactment of Civil War battles, and Memorial Days were part of the healing process for white Southerners. The negative effects of these memorials cannot be overlooked, however. Hero-worship of the Confederacy and its leaders led to increased social, political and racial tensions after the war.

As many Confederate soldiers deserted and returned to their families, General Robert E. Lee appealed to their \"honor and duty\" by presenting only two options: \"war [or] abject submission.\" The only logical choice seemed to be a continuation of the fight for self-government at any cost. Lee offered pardon to any man \"improperly absent\" as long as he returned \"within the shortest possible time within 20 days.\" He declared that \"no general amnesty [would] again be granted\" in this final effort to reabsorb deserters into the Army of the Confederacy. Unfortunately for Lee, offering a sweeping pardon did not significantly recoup his dwindling supply of men still willing to fight.","Historians have pointed to desertion as one of the primary reasons for the South's defeat in the Civil War. The notion of the Civil War being a \"rich man's war, and a poor man's fight\" was a huge factor in desertion rates. One school of thought believes that as the war progressed, the yeoman farmers who were doing the majority of the fighting came to resent the planter aristocracy that was often exempted from military service due to various Confederate policies. The war became increasingly difficult, and many soldiers deserted due to economics, family, and personal sentiments. The less a man identified with the cause he was fighting for, the more likely he was to desert. Yeoman farmers did not own slaves, and the principles of slavery were not worth fighting and dying for as the war proceeded. In the final months of the war, desertion rates escalated as it became clear that the South would not emerge the victors.","James McPherson examines the Confederate soldier's experience through various diaries and letters and disagrees with this position. McPherson claims that Confederate men did not gain the conventional disillusionment and cynicism that would logically lead to desertion. The sources that he examines show soldiers continuing to assert the importance of the ideals they were fighting for throughout the conflict. Reasons for fighting would include defending their government, their manhood, their families, and their comrades. Although the reasons for desertion are clearly a subject of great debate among historians, it is clear that desertion made it increasingly difficult to pursue the collective goals of the Confederacy on the battlefield and inevitably contributed to Lee's surrender several months later."],"locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":4083,"title":"Proof of Allegiance\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-27","end_date":"1865-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 25, 1865, John Herbert Claiborne took the oath of allegiance to the United States at the Office of the Provost Marshal in Petersburg, Virginia. He served as a surgeon with the title of Major in the Confederate Army during the war and continued to practice medicine after the surrender. In the terms of the oath he swore to \"support and defend the Constitution\" and to support all laws including \"the emancipation of slaves\" from that time forward. By taking this oath, he secured amnesty for serving the Confederacy during the war, considered an act of treason. That day he received a slip of paper noting that he had taken the oath, but he returned six days later to request a letter from the Provost Marshall confirming his allegiance and giving him permission to purchase a pistol for his own protection. Almost a month later, on June 26, he returned yet again for a duplicate certificate of his Oath of Allegiance. Papers such as these restored J.H. Claiborne and other former Confederates to their status of citizens of the United States during Reconstruction, a time when a Confederate war record often excluded men from the political landscape they once ruled. Generals Lee and Grant determined the terms of the surrender at Appomattox, but this agreement did not begin to address many of the questions created by the end of the struggle. Politicians determined the terms of reunion during the era of Reconstruction. The status of Confederate veterans proved to be a controversial issue in the halls of Congress as well as throughout the South. On one hand, Southerners needed to be punished for their rebellion, and it would be irresponsible to place the same white aristocracy back in power post-war. However, to suppress almost the entire white male population would leave few educated men to rebuild the southern governments.","President Johnson laid out the terms for Confederate amnesty in May 1865 through a proclamation that gave amnesty restoring all rights and property (except for slaves) to ex-Confederates who would take an oath of loyalty to the Union. Exempted from the proclamation were top ranking Confederates, as well as owners of more than 20,000 in property. These southerners who were not given amnesty in the proclamation would have to swallow their pride and appeal to the President Johnson for amnesty. Inevitably Johnson pardoned almost anyone who requested one, a much more lenient policy than the previously proposed Wade-Davis Bill of June 1864 that required men to swear that they had never aided the Confederacy in order to participate politically. Johnson pardoned over 7,000 men by 1866 restoring the white aristocracy to power and destroying the moment of hope for black equality and political participation."],"locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":4084,"title":"The University in Wars Wake\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-07","end_date":"1865-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As John Minor, an esteemed law professor, sat in his office at the University of Virginia, he penned a letter to his sister in Galveston, Texas explaining the \"unparalleled losses\" suffered by Virginia.

The war had ended months before, but the men of Matthews County still felt the need to protect themselves. The possibility of an insurrection of the newly autonomous group of freedmen in their area terrified the white men of Matthews County. According to the 1860 and 1870 census, freedmen composed almost one half of the population in Matthews, and if united, they could pose a threat to white landowners. The <em>Norfolk Virginian</em> claimed that \"Negroes [were] ... buying arms wherever they [could] procure them\" and \"uttering serious threats.\" This spirit of revenge was thought to exist in freedmen throughout Virginia and the entire South. Conflicts between the freedmen and whites stemmed from the fact that freedmen did not want to be employed by whites under year-long contracts or other conditions similar to slavery.","White fears of \"Negro domination\" manifested themselves in various ways, such as the formation of a militia in Matthews County, Virginia. In other areas of the South white supremacy groups such as the KKK formed to violently force the black community into submission through violence. Eric Foner discusses the conflicts of implementing a free labor system in the South in his <em>Short History of Reconstruction. </em>Fears of a takeover by blacks existed long before they became freedmen. During slavery, plantation owners lived in constant fear of the possibility of a slave revolt. The Thirteenth Amendment freed the slaves and opened the door to a world of free labor in the southern states. With increasing autonomy in their labor decisions it was plausible that freedmen may seek some sort of revenge on their previous masters. In general, however, most slaves did not desire to seek violent restitution for their time in slavery. Although some freedmen demanded land rights from their masters as payment for their labor during slavery, most focused on reuniting their families, educating themselves, and establishing a black community.  Blacks disliked the year long contracts because they did not allow them to choose the crops they planted and they did not repay them fairly for their labor. Eventually sharecropping emerged as a new form of tenancy that was touted as beneficial to both whites and blacks, and the contract system faded away."],"locations":[{"id":14039,"lat":37.3887731419,"lng":-76.252448521,"zoom":10,"place":"MATHEWS, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":4106,"title":"Manufacturing in post-War Mississippi\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-01","end_date":"1875-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Did we learn anything from the War?  The <em>Natchez Weekly Democrat, </em>a local newspaper located in Natchez,  Mississippi, asked this question of its readers in more polite terms.  In July, 1875, the newspaper lamented the lack of economic development in the form of manufacturing over the previous years in the surrounding area.  Southerners in all parts of the former Confederacy were aware that the lack of manufacturing capability outside of the state of Virginia had given the North too great of an advantage during the war.  Without citing any specific examples, the paper stated that very little had changed about the local economy in the past decade.  ","Besides the obvious lack of slave labor, Natchez and surrounding environs remained largely agricultural, with no significant manufacturing sector to speak of.  An examination of both the 1870 and 1880 United States census data (which measured the amount of capital invested in manufacturing in dollars) supports the newspaper's claim.  In 1870, there was 4,501,714 invested in manufacturing in Mississippi.  Ten years later, this figure had only grown to 4,727,600, an increase of merely 225,886.  This amounts to an increase of approximately five percent over the 1870 level in the following decade, which is far behind usual growth patterns.  This lack of manufacturing growth means that very few new jobs were created.  The livelihoods of former slaves and poor whites were still largely based in agriculture, but they very rarely owned their own land and instead contributed to the vast increase in the practice of sharecropping.  Natchez was far from unusual in the South.  By 1880, the Southern states accounted for roughly the same percentage of industrial development nationwide as they had before the war.  The South's industrial development continued to lag behind the country as a whole and would well into the twentieth century.

These unique persons in the state of Delaware took many strides to become autonomous. Free black citizens accepted jobs that were not related to slave labor. Free blacks instead of taking on jobs related to working fields and crops became artisans and engaged in skilled labor .They even created their own jobs, such as saw mill workers, engineers, fisherman, and hat makers. By 1857 more than twelve percent of the free black population in Delaware were skilled laborers.

For many Southern women especially, who suddenly became responsible for managing farms and plantations on their own while living with battles being fought in their backyards, their experiences on the home front deeply influenced their opinions of the national conflict. Perhaps such events would have caused women like Narcissa Barksdale and Alice Janney to rally around the Confederate troops and encourage them to fight harder against the invading Union forces, but then again these same events could have just as easily spurned a desire to simply stop the fighting and bring the troops home.

One of the largest human chattel holding in North America-- 436 men, women, and infants according to Mrs. Kembles journal-were divided among the heirs. The slaves were brought to Savannah in small convenient groups. \"Half a Negro stock on major butlers plantation, fell to one of the 2 heirs of that estate\" Kembles noted. Also, the slaves were given a full body examination in preparation for the auctioning held on their seventh day in captivity. Slaves had experienced their mouths being pulled; and limbs pinched, to test their muscle structure. ",". Joseph Bryan was a slave broker who managed the sale of the slaves on the auction block. It was Bryan's job to keep the slaves fed, housed, and healthy up until the day of the auctioning. Slaves were placed in cages before they were sold. The floors that the slaves slept and ate on were bare and cold. The clothing they received during this transition phase was minimal and uncouth. The children were more carefully dressed and cared for than adults. The examinations slaves went through were to test their abilities and give their future masters insight into their productivity levels. As historian Walter Johnson has demonstrated, these rituals were common in the larger more prominent slave pens of late antebellum New Orleans. Whether sold locally or over long distances, black men, women, and children faced similarly dehumanizing experiences in the domestic slave trade."],"locations":[{"id":2215,"lat":32.0631498029,"lng":-84.7548301865,"zoom":10,"place":"STEWART, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}]},{"id":4186,"title":"What Are You Fighting For?\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The message was clear; those fighting for the Confederate Army were \"destroy[ing] the government of [their] fathers.\"  In an advertisement in 1862 in Winchester, Virginia, the government established by the \"the patriot statesmen and warriors of the revolution\" asked that the confederate soldiers \"throw down [their] arms\" and come rejoin the Union.  The ad insisted that the \"bad men\" of the confederacy stood in the way of \"one flag, one land, one heart, one hand, One nation evermore.\" Most importantly, the public notice asked the soldiers, \"what are you fighting for?\" ","                  Desertion was already a problem for the Confederate Army during the Civil War.  Tens of thousands deserted the Confederate Army between the years of 1862 and 1865.  Some believe desertion to be a main factor in the South's defeat.  Union propaganda only worsened this problem.  With emotional words and a call to desert the army, many more confederate soldiers, who were already unhappy due to low morale often caused by defeat, left the army.  Despite this, the desertion rate for the Confederate Army was lower than that of the Union Army.  Many agree that a majority of the Confederate Army volunteers continued their service to the army until the end of the war, and that the high desertion numbers in the Confederate Army were only partially due to soldiers deserting their camps.  Many soldiers who either died in battle but were never found, or who left their camp and served in another unit are counted in the number of deserters.  In April, 1865 thousands did desert the Confederate Army and days later General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union Army in Appotomax, Virginia.

According to the <em>Norfolk Virginian</em>, the Board of Health expected Asiatic cholera to spread to North America soon.  The United States had seen cholera before.  In 1832, it spread through New York and parts of Canada. It killed over ten thousand in New York, New Orleans, and St. Louis in 1849.  Several thousands more were lost in Chicago in the 1850s.  Each of these surges in the spread of this disease followed major outbreaks in Europe.   ","            The fear that this Asiatic cholera would again become a pandemic in the United States caused the government to order new sanitary measures.  Previously, people did not know the cause of cholera, but by the 1860s, public health officials suspected dirty water to be the source of the disease spreading and the new public sanitary measures reflected this. The Board of Health ordered that certain lots, some privately owned, be filled with dirt to prevent standing water from accumulating.  Also, the Board expected all householders to clean their property every day and their gutters at least twice a week.  Furthermore, all docks were to be cleaned and all accumulating shells, mud, filth and decaying wood were to be cleared every day so that no area had less than two feet of water at any time.  The military did not play a large role in the implementation of these measures, but the city employed extra assistant health inspectors to check that the orders were being carried out and put them into action where they were not being followed.  ","            Unfortunately, the measures were unsuccessful and cholera broke out in America once again.  This time, the epidemic killed as many people as before, and caused even more tension in the nation, which was already suffering due to Reconstruction.  Unfortunately outbreaks of bacterial infections such as this were a devastating reality long after 1860, and though they are less frequent now and can be treated, they still plague parts of the world."],"locations":[{"id":14075,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}]},{"id":4188,"title":"Admiral Semmes Charged With Treason\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-12-25","end_date":"1865-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Civil War was over, and it was time for those who led the South to be punished.  <em>The Norfolk Virginian</em> reported on Monday, December 25, 1865, that the Union arrested \"Raphael Semmes, late Admiral in the Confederate navy, and commander of the celebrated cruiser Alabama,\" with \"a profound feeling of shame.\"  The people of the South lamented the \"unexpected arrest and immediate transfer to a Northern jail\" of this \"true born American,\" and considered Admiral Semmes a war hero.  His most celebrated and \"most unequal fight\" was against the French vessel, the <em>Kearsage</em>, in which he \"gallantly sunk, rather than give up his ship.\"  The government charged the venerated Admiral with \"violating the usage of war\" for the aforementioned battle, which took place in June 1865, over a month after the command to \"cease all acts of war\" on April 26, 1865.

Many men in various ranks were charged with treason, and the South despised each arrest and often publicly disapproved of the arrests of their recently celebrated heroes.  The Union did not arrest many officers, however.  Though a great many in the North, including President Andrew Johnson, believed that treason was \"odious\" and should be punished by death, the law dictated that the Union had no jurisdiction to prosecute the rebels.

With the end of the war, the issue of reuniting the country was topic of both local and national interest. The prospect of joining the nation under a common ideology and purpose was one that was imperative to piecing together the broken nation. However, the fact that the country has just emerged from a long and arduous civil war entrenched in the ideas of varying ideologies made this repair a daunting task. Although Montgomery was located deep within the former Confederacy, the Advertiser's outlook of the upcoming convention was positive. The paper described an idyllic prospect, claiming a \"spectacle of men from the North and South mingling together in harmonious counsel will go a long way towards sustaining him [Andrew Johnson] and breaking down the power of those who are alike, enemies to him and to constitutional liberty.\"","    Upon the end of the Civil War, many people, both of northern and southern origins and loyalties, had become weary of the war. Families longed to be reunited and there was a hope for a return to a normal and stable way of life. As the Advertiser described, there was the hope that both Northerners and Southerners would be able to find common ground through support of Andrew Johnson, but, Johnson's blatant opposition to proposed legislation such as the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act made it unclear exactly how dedicated Johnson himself was to fully reuniting the nation. ","    Although there was a feeling among Americans that the country was in need of repair, there were many Southerners and delegates to the National Convention from Alabama and other former Confederate states who, \"though willing to concede defeat at the hands of the Union army...would not, as the unionists demanded, admit wrong doing in 1861.\" This failure to accept war guilt also extended into other facets of life as well. Many southern states refused to acknowledge the rights of blacks following the end of the war. Governments across the South instituted Black Codes to restrict the rights and lifestyles of African Americans, or simply tried their best to return freedmen to a status as close to slavery as possible. Highlighting this Southern attitude, it became obvious that the issue of rebuilding the nation and the policy of Reconstruction that soon ensued was not enough to the cause the South to forget the war and ideology that fueled it in the first place."],"locations":[{"id":301,"lat":32.2488115675,"lng":-86.1666274124,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]}]}
