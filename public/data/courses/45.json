Between July and October of this year, Wheaton made a number of transactions with a man, Sumner Blandin. Looking at the records reveals that Blandin came to Wheaton about once a week, usually to get cash instead of food or goods. Additionally, Blandin appeared in almost every other one of Wheaton’s transactions for these few months. However, after this time Blandin’s name disappeared from the record."," ","The nineteenth century was a time for technological and agricultural change. A shift in farming during this time emerged as a result of new technology, but also from a changing need. For instance, now farmers not only produced food for themselves, but they worked to produce a surplus to trade or sell. Sometimes farmers would have to hire extra laborers for a short time to help with this farming. Laban Morey Wheaton was a wealthier farmer than most, as he was also a trained lawyer, a businessman, and a strong presence in the community. As a landowner and dairy farmer, Wheaton needed help from his community to run his factories and farms. Hence, Wheaton’s accounts with Sumner Blandin may indicate that Blandin worked for Wheaton for a short amount of time. This could explain the disappearance of Blandin from Wheaton’s account books, as he was only needed for a short time. Furthermore, it can justify the many cash transactions that happened between the two, as Wheaton was probably paying Blandin for his services. Lastly, the frequency of transactions with Blandin could also result from his frequent work as a hired laborer. Therefore, looking at the account books of a man like Laban Morey Wheaton may be able to reveal the shift in farming during the mid-nineteenth century."," "],"locations":[{"id":6120,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":686,"tag":"Wheaton"},{"id":685,"tag":"accounting records"},{"id":684,"tag":"mid-nineteenth century"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}]},{"id":5025,"title":"Potato Agriculture in the Mid-Nineteenth Century","course_id":45,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-05-20","end_date":"1840-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the New England foliage began to turn in October of 1840, Laban Morey Wheaton sold Linus Howard an astonishing twenty-five bushels of potatoes, and only a couple of short days later Linus returned for another five bushels of potatoes. What could possibly explain this surge in the demand for potatoes in Norton Massachusetts? Laban dealt with many transactions concerning potatoes as indicated within his daybook. During the spring planting season five individuals stopped by Laban’s store demanding varying amounts of potatoes. Similarly during the fall harvesting season his store received roughly the same demand for potatoes with the price per bushel remaining a consistent twenty-five cents. New England agriculture during the early to middle nineteenth century experienced a fluctuating climate. It was an ice age on a small scale that left farmers with dry summers and bitterly frozen winters. New England’s harsh weather during this time had a tremendous affect upon its society, agriculture, and human way of life.","My answer to the reader lies within the potato plant itself and how it functioned as one of the leading staple crops in New England during the nineteenth century along side corn and small grains. Keep in mind the chunk of history I am unearthing deals with potatoes within their context before the outbreak of the “Potato Blight” epidemic that took place in the year 1844. The cultivation of potatoes provided New England’s farmers with consistently successful crop yields during a time when many crops would fail due to the harsh weather. In comparison to other crops, potatoes could thrive in the cold weather and provided more calories per acre than any other crop. Potato farming was the ideal crop for New England farmers; they were cheap, allowed for rapid agricultural production, and were capable of feeding humans as well as livestock.","Laban’s frequent potato transactions within the town of Norton, Massachusetts at first appears suspicious due to the fact that Mr. Wheaton was not a farmer, but instead a cotton textile mill owner and entrepreneur. These facts draw a correlation between the sale of potatoes and cotton textile mills during this time in history. Potato farmers from Vermont tell a similar story: “Vermonters began selling their potatoes to the starch factories springing up throughout the region. Levi Bailey operated a small one in Reading, Vermont, which opened in 1831 and sold its processed potato starch to agents who conveyed it to the large textile mills in Lowell and Providence.” (Demeritt, 148) This quotation shows the use of starch created by potatoes in manufacturing textiles. Laban Morey Wheaton dealt with numerous transactions of potatoes because the plant itself was an abundant New England crop that was useful to everyone and satisfied the needs of his cotton textile mill."],"locations":[{"id":6120,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":684,"tag":"mid-nineteenth century"},{"id":686,"tag":"Wheaton"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":690,"tag":"Potatoes"},{"id":688,"tag":"Textile Mills"}]},{"id":5026,"title":"Hired farm labor in the 1840's","course_id":45,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-02-13","end_date":"1840-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between February 13<sup>th</sup> and April 9<sup>th</sup>, 1840, Joseph Borden was absent from work multiple times. He worked as a hired farm hand for Laban Morey Wheaton. Sometimes he was gone a half day or the entire day, but Wheaton took note of every absence in his daybook. Borden seemed to be a loyal and favored worker, however, for he continued to be paid for his labor over the months. There are a number of possible reasons for his absence from the farm: he could have been ill, or sent home if there was no work to do, or taken the day off for family or personal issues. Either way, Joseph Borden was treated well by his employer due to his loyalty.","By the mid-1820’s, hired labor had replaced family labor on farms. This change occurred because farmers were expanding their production, both in the number of crops being harvested for market, and the increasing necessity to be self-sufficient on the homestead. Farmers needed more help than ever, and relying on a small number of family members for help wasn’t always an option, as most farmers’ children left town when they were able to.  As there were an increasing number of farm hands available, it was important for farmers to seek out hard working and faithful men to work on their land. There were many, cheaper workers that were lazy and uninterested in doing diligent work. So when a farmer found a loyal helper, it was beneficial to both people to develop an understanding relationship. If the farm hand needed time off from work, his employer would allow it because he knew his helper would be back soon to continue his work."],"locations":[{"id":6120,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":691,"tag":"Farm Labor"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}]}]}
