Gottschall traveled across the North American continent four times from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which took him twelve years to do.  During his travels, Gottschall lived with the Indians he came across.  Gottschall wrote all his experiences down, especially with the Sioux from whom he later picked up the Sioux language.  Gottschall became very fascinated with the Indians and decided to become knowlegeable about them in order to correct the misperceptions others had of them.  In his twelve year narrative, Gottschall wrote a  passage about his intentions to inform Americans about the Indians they misunderstood:","<strong>“</strong>I used to tell the Sioux that I intended to make a \"wo-wah-pe\" (book) for the white people to read, and that in it I would describe the Indian mode of life, and inform my people just how I fared at the hands of the Indians. This always pleased them, and doubtless influenced them to treat me well” (Gottschall161).","If the Sioux refused to follow or comply with the methods of America’s Indian policy in solving the Indian problem, then America would use military force and intimidation to get the Sioux.  Although the Sioux tried to use peaceful solutions, something would always go wrong in which it seemed that fate was not swinging in their direction.  The treaty would be broken as both sides failed to keep their promises, but the Sioux broke theirs because the federal government did not keep theirs in the first place by not preventing white settlers and their livestock from encroaching on Sioux lands.  More white settlers failed to recognize the agreements made in the Fort Laramie Treaty and continued to trespass and settle in Sioux lands which drove the buffalo herds away.  In addition, more emigrants were traveling to California and Oregon over many new trails like the John Bozeman Trail, starting from Fort Laramie and ending in Virginia City, Montana.  These new trails also drove the buffalo herds away, and the Sioux and their allies were enraged.  The white travelers and settlers “committed depredations, and, despite the guarantee of the United States to the Indians in the treaty of 1851, were left unpunished” (Textor 104).  As a result, the United States broke their treaty agreements.","Because America failed to keep their promises in the treaties, war occurred.  Broken treaties led to the first series of the Sioux War which began in 1862 with the Santee and other tribes in the eastern territory of the Sioux where Minnesota and Missouri are today (Robinson 16).  Led by Little Crow, the Santee raided, attacked and pillaged a village and fort killing hundreds of settlers and soldiers.  Gottschall wrote about this saying, \"During the years 1862 and 1863, the immigration to Dakota was almost entirely stopped by the Sioux war. Hundreds of settlers were killed in Minnesota and Dakota at that time; but a great change has since taken place, and the fine soil and lovely prairies and valleys are rapidly luring emigrants to seek homes within its borders. Gottschall wrote about the results during one of the Sioux Wars: \"Prior to the year 1858, what is now known as Dakota, was unceded land, and belonged to the Sioux Indians. In that year a treaty was made with the Sioux, and the land taken from them; it was not organized as a territory, however, until the winter of 1861 … Dakota is very large, and as yet, only a small part of it, comparatively, is settled by the whites, the remainder being still the hunting-ground of the Sioux and other Indian tribes” (Gottschall 70).","The war ended when the Santee and their allies lost the Battle of Wood Lake on September 23, 1862.  Thirty-eight warriors were convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging on December 23, 1862.  Some of the remaining Santee joined the Lakotas in the western Sioux territory."],"locations":[{"id":15204,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DATOKA TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":1215,"tag":"Sioux Wars"},{"id":1214,"tag":"Sioux"},{"id":1151,"tag":"Buffalo"},{"id":180,"tag":"Indians"},{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"}]},{"id":5282,"title":"<strong>Yellow Fever Attacks Philadelphia, 1793.</strong>","course_id":70,"status":"P","start_date":"8/3/73","end_date":"10/28/73","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1793, Philadelphia was the site of the most fearsome epidemic to strike the young nation. By July, the city's inhabitants were remarking on the extraordinary number of flies and mosquitoes that swarmed around the dock area. Caribbean refugees brought Yellow Fever. In one epidemic alone, 5,000 residents — nearly one-tenth of the population — perished. Hardly a family was untouched. Many people left the city.  People of every rank and station wanted to escape the spreading pestilence. Most of those who stayed were poor and had no place to go. A few – a very few - chose to stay because they felt a sense of duty to their city and its trapped inhabitants.","In his letter to Thomas Mann Randolph in September 2, 1793, Thomas Jefferson wrote that a malignant fever had been generated in the filth of the docks of Philadelphia which had given great alarm. One of the prominent doctors at that time in Philadelphia was Dr. Benjamin Rush. He decided to try the strongest purge he knew of, known as the “Ten-and-Ten.” Many doctors disputed Rush’s cure rate. The debate carried on in the city’s newspapers, so that all the citizens knew of the dispute. A new committee led by Mayor Clarkson put the best hospital -- Bush Hill -- into decent operating order, and the spirits of the patients began to improve. French Dr. Deveze volunteered for the full time position as physician there. He did not believe in Rush’s cure. At first there was some hesitation in the committee over hiring a French doctor. It would seem like a slap at all the American doctors, especially Dr. Rush. Deveze's treatment was cautious and gentle. Despite growing evidence that the “French cure” was effective in keeping patients alive, it still came in for wide criticism. Benjamin Rush attacked the mild methods used by Jean Deveze and others, even though he had no real statistics to back his claims.","No one would ever know precisely how many Philadelphians died of yellow fever in 1793. What was clear to all was that life would never be the same. Changes also came to the city because of the fever. Efforts were made to keep the markets and streets free of offensive-smelling matter, and the laws holding homeowners responsible for cleaning up their property were strengthened. The biggest improvement was made in the way water was supplied to Philadelphia. Water from the system – the first water system in the United States – was sweeter tasting and had no offensive odor. Plus the water flowed with enough force to hose streets and docks clean and to flush open clogged sewers. Eliminating the backbreaking need to hand-pump every drop of water had another beneficial effect as well. People began to bathe more often. Everyone – even those who had run from the city – considered himself or herself a survivor. They were a people left scarred, emotionally and physically. Sudden, mass death had stricken their city, and they were no wiser at all about the nature of the killer. They knew only one thing for certain: when next summer’s hot, humid weather returned, yellow fever might very well visit their homes again."],"locations":[{"id":36656,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":506,"tag":"Thomas Jefferson"},{"id":763,"tag":"epidemic"},{"id":403,"tag":"Yellow Fever"},{"id":1037,"tag":"Benjamin Rush"}]}]}
