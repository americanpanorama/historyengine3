While the costume superheroes have been a mainstay of United States culture since 1938, the current media explosion connected to the superhero suggests these characters have reached a new level of cultural importance. The goals of this seminar are to explore the history, evolution, and concerns linked to superhero comic books in the United States. What defines the superhero? When, how, and why did the superhero emerge and evolve? This seminar will examine the definition of the superhero, consider the evolution of the superhero in print, and consider how readers (fans) have engaged with the superhero.","points":[[34.1808392,-118.3089661],[41.0534302,-73.5387341],[40.7127753,-74.0059728],[38.9071923,-77.0368707],[34.9592083,-116.419389],[44.3148443,-85.6023643],[47.7827941,-120.9263262],[42.7353595,-84.4831298],[43.765087,-84.8209346],[42.7179089,-84.5539748],[40.1434317,-89.5397361],[42.3250896,-72.6412013]],"bounds":[[47.7827941,-72.6412013],[34.1808392,-120.9263262]],"episodes":[{"id":6805,"title":"From Embarrassment to Capitalization: The Two-Year Turnaround of the Teen Titans","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/64","end_date":"1/31/82","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Making their first appearance in 1964, the Teen Titans were born out of a long history of a group of youths such as the Young Allies, the Newsboy Legion, the Boy Commandos, and others. In 1978, the original, and already once revived, Teen Titans comic series ran its final issue, number 53. Though the final issue ran the same year of the DC Implosion, the cancellation of the Teen Titans was not a product of the economic issues at DC, but rather the changes occurring in the comic book industry. The growing prominence of the direct market, the rise of the underground, and the maturation of the industry helped seal the fate of the Teen Titans. DC’s reported embarrassment regarding a book about junior superheroes did not help matters either.","            The comic book industry did not mature overnight, and to understand the process that ushered in the mindset of the mid-Bronze age I turn to Denny O’Neil and Robert Crumb. O’Neil was one of the comic creators who had a distinct anti-authority superhero narrative post-Wertham. O’Neil’s <em>Green Lantern/Green Arrow </em>series being the main vehicle through which O’Neil gave the population more socially conscious and mature stories with Green Lantern acting as the buddy of the authority where Green Arrow was the counterculture figure who knew what was going on. This is not to say that Teen Titans did not feature mature topics, one dealt with the accidental death of a peace activist during the Vietnam war, but <em>Green Lantern/Green Arrow</em> dealt with these issues with a different voice. I chose Crumb to represent the rise of underground, counterculture comics aimed at more mature audiences that were aided by the rise of the direct market in the 80s. Crumb’s work was not going for the same audience as O’Neil’s as evidenced by the fact that many underground comics, or comix, were sold at drug paraphernalia stores, but they represented the same process of maturation of the comic art form. The underground comix also represent the shift of comics from newsstand staples to special interest items to be found within specialized stores. ","These factors combined to spell doom for the Teen Titans in 1978, but they also caused its revival two years later. One may venture to ask how the New Teen Titans emerged from the ashes of the old, and the answer is two-fold. Firstly, the New Teen Titans were a product of the power of star comic talent, a concept which had emerged during the O’Neil years with figures like Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The two artists responsible for the creation of <em>the New Teen Titans</em> were new DC recruits former Marvel-men Marv Wolfman and George Perez. However, the Teen Titans mostly owe their revival to one group: <em>The Uncanny X-Men.</em> The overwhelming success of this Marvel title secured the idea that stories surrounding a multicultural group of teenage superheroes could be profitable, and money does a lot to alleviate embarrassment. The New Teen <em>Titans</em> and <em>the Uncanny X-Men</em> met in a crossover comic in 1982, thus cementing their link in the minds of many.","Revived by the forces that caused them to close shop, the Teen Titans are a case study in the desires of the comic book market."],"locations":[{"id":53141,"lat":34.1808392,"lng":-118.3089661,"zoom":8,"place":"Burbank, California"}],"tags":[{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":3566,"tag":"Teen Titans"},{"id":3567,"tag":"DC"}]},{"id":6806,"title":"Steve Gerber's \"Destroyer Duck\" and the Fight for Creator's Rights","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/73","end_date":"12/31/90","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1982, the relationship between comic books, their creator’s, and the companies who published them reached a new stage as Steve Gerber’s <em>Destroyer Duck #1</em> was released. In the eleventh issue of <em>Amazing Heroes</em>, Kevin McConnell’s review of Gerber’s <em>Destroyer Duck #1</em> is both a review of the comic book and a gateway to discuss creator’s rights — an issue that only rose in importance the preceding and following years. McConnell’s review discusses Gerber’s legal situation at the time and lays the foundation for the ongoing intellectual-property battle between comic book creators and companies who employed them.","In 1973, Steve Gerber created Howard the Duck — a widely-popular, anthropomorphic duck that had an initial thirty-three series run (marvel.wikia.com). However, just because Gerber created Howard didn’t mean he owned him. As he initially created the character, Gerber worked for Marvel Comics, thus leaving the rights to Howard in Marvel’s hands after Gerber left. This left Gerber angry, so he created a new comic, <em>Destroyer Duck</em>, which served as an allegory to Gerber wanting the rights to Howard, as well as creator’s rights as a whole. In fact, during the time Gerber created and published <em>Destroyer Duck #1</em>, he was locked in legal battle with Marvel over possession of Howard (Amazing Heroes, 57). As McConnell’s review explains, “Gerber’s message [in Destroyer Duck #1] is clear — he wants his duck back… Considering this, perhaps creators’ rights are … going to have to be re-evaluated.” (Amazing Heroes, 58). And re-evaluated they were.","During the second half of the 1970’s, the long-standing publisher-creator contract was about to change thanks to numerous comic book creator’s sharing the same beliefs that Gerber held. Since the industry began, creators were on a work-for-hire basis, meaning all work they contributed during their contract became property of the publisher when finished (Wright, 256). The most famous byproduct of this relationship, of course, is that of Jerry Seigel and Joe Shuster, who sold the rights of “Superman” to Detective Comics for an infinitesimally-small $130. Or, similarly, the creative work of Gerber staying with Marvel after his departure. Creators of the 1970’s, however, were changing this one-sided affair. Demanding royalties, creative incentives, and a greater sense of entitlement to their work, this new generation of comic creators were not backing down to publishers — including Gerber and his fight for Howard. A new copyright law went into effect in 1978, clearing up any uncertainty between creators and publishers, and some creators were able to win greater creative concessions in the aftermath. However, at the end of it all, not much had changed. Work-for-hire still existed as it did before, and now many companies were more explicitly stating what properties belonged to them (Wright, 257).","With no drastic change, creator-backlash continued and ultimately culminated in 1990 with the publication of “A Bill of Rights for Comics Creators,” a twelve-amendment article specifically listing the various rights and dignities of creators everywhere (scottmccloud.com). With amendments like “The right to full ownership of what we fully create,” “The right of approval over the reproduction and format of our creative property,” and “The right to free movement of ourselves and our creative property to and from publishers,” the message is clear. Comic creators still believed the ownership of what they create should rest in their hands, not in the hands of the company they temporarily work for.","McConnell ends his review by stating “To conclude, Destroyer Duck is a fundamental stepping stone in Gerber’s possible acquisition of Howard. And if he were able to accomplish that feat — well, some of those incredibly outre stories he scripted for Marvel would be but a pale prelude… Something worth watching, I think.” (Amazing Heroes, 58). Steve Gerber never officially regained the rights to Howard the Duck, but his never-ending battle for his creation did set a precedent to many other creators around the world and helped pave the way for the publishing of “A Bill of Rights for Comics Creators.” Even though Gerber never was able to officially reclaim Howard, Destroyer Duck had better success in the matter. In a later issue of Destroyer Duck, Howard the Duck is cloned, resulting in hundreds of Howards running free in a warehouse. In the end, Destroyer Duck states that he “got the real one,” and promptly escapes the scene with the real Howard in hand (birthmoviesdeath.com)."],"locations":[{"id":53142,"lat":41.0534302,"lng":-73.5387341,"zoom":8,"place":"Stamford, CT"}],"tags":[{"id":3569,"tag":"Marvel"},{"id":3568,"tag":"Destroyer the

In 1986, DC Comics announced Dennis O’Neil as the writer for the revitalization of the investigative reporter and vigilante hero, The Question.  Originally created by Steve Ditko for Charlton Comics in 1967, The Question, aka Vic Sage, represented a move away from the wholesome, all-powerful superhero and toward a grittier, more human hero.  O’Neil described The Question as an emblem of “human perfectibility,” as much more realistic and flawed than the superheroes of the late 1950s and 1960s.  The Question was to be a vigilante antihero, combatting growing crime and corruption in the nation’s inner cities.  Because of “direct-market distribution” (Wright 277), the comic book industry no longer had to follow the Comics Code Authority in order to sell their characters, so <em>The Question</em> and other comics were able to show the darker and more violent side of American cities.  Distrust in government following the Vietnam War and the perception of rapidly growing crime in inner cities in 1980s America informed the updating of DC’s antihero detective The Question.","            The dishonesty and ineffectiveness of the local government in the revamped <em>The Question</em> comic books reflected the views about government in America following the Vietnam War.  Richard Young asserts that “the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal encouraged enormous public distrust in official state institutions” (566) and that comics in the 1980s “often endorsed an uncompromising anti?establishment ideology that opposed all government, big or small” (563).  People felt as though the war was orchestrated by selfish and inept politicians who cared more about reinforcing an outdated ideology than about the actual citizens.  Vic Sage operated in Hub City, which O’Neil describes as a “cesspool” of crime and corruption.  The mayor, Wesley Fermin, was an inept leader being influenced by Reverend Doctor Jeremiah Hatch, who used the city’s resources for his own personal benefit.  Fermin and Hatch represented government officials who failed in their duty to serve the people, lying to and stealing from city dwellers whenever it was deemed necessary.  The Question’s resistance to this narrative of government corruption gave comic book readers the ability to express their anger and frustration toward their leaders.  DC’s newly revived character reflected the public’s lack of trust in government, not only to use power honestly, but also to protect them from violent crime in the inner cities.","            The growing fear of crime in urban areas during the 1980s led to the introduction of vigilante antiheroes in comic books, which include <em>The Question</em>.  Decades of white flight to the suburbs and the moving of American industry overseas left many poor people of color out of work.  Unable to find well paying jobs, some people turned to crime in order to make money.  The distribution of crack cocaine contributed to a massive growth in the crime rate and overwhelmed law enforcement agencies.  White Americans lived in terror that criminals from the city would travel to their quiet streets and so began a crusade against inner city lawlessness.  Tyler Scully and Kenneth Moorman argue that “A new fear gripped the nation, one that was quite foreign to generations past: a fear of crime, particularly violent, street crime” (635).  Already unhappy with the government after years of fruitless war, the public turned to vigilantes to make themselves feel safer.  The comic book industry created characters such as The Question in response to the popularity of real-life vigilante heroes.  Inspired by urban detectives from the early 1900s, Vic Sage did for the people of Hub City what Fermin and Hatch could not.  He operated outside of the law and worked to clean up the crime-ridden streets of Hub City.  Dennis O’Neil’s reimagining of <em>The Question </em>demonstrated the public’s anxiety about inner city crime and support for vigilante antiheroes.","            The revitalization of <em>The Question</em> by Dennis O’Neil in 1986 reflected the anti-government feelings of the public during the decade.  The failure of the Vietnam War and the rapidly growing fear of inner cities caused many people lose trust in their leaders.  Vigilantes, both real and imagined, captured the attention of many Americans.  DC’s revival of <em>The Question</em> and development of Hub City addressed the concerns of comic book readers during the 1980s."],"locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"}],"tags":[{"id":3574,"tag":"Hub

tensions arise in the sphere of gender rights in America, Spider-Man swings in to save the day, or at least save the men of the world from the threat of feminism. In August 1981, Fantagraphics Books released their third issue of <em>Amazing Heroes</em> which includes an interview with the new editor for Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man</em> titles, Tom DeFalco, on his plan to “revitalize” Spider-Man by “returning to the ‘grandeur and the power and the menace” of the hero’s original days. As Spidey’s revamping to “use his powers to the fullest potential,” the push to extend the date for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratifications was struggling under the presidency of Ronald Reagan (Amazing Heroes 54). The Equal Rights Amendment, passing on March 22, 1972, had a seven-year deadline on ratification processes, meaning it could not be ratified after 1979. Congress approved an extension until June 30, 1982, but after the swearing in of Ronald Reagan, the ERA lost its support from the republican party (Francis). On the major political loss, Anne Costain says, “what makes gender differences distinctive in the 1980s is that they are now tied to a consistent preference in the part of women for the democratic party and its candidates” (Costain 115). A citizen’s right to not be denied or abridged based on their sex was undermined by more than half of the political system: the feminist movement was battling against Reagan’s presidency.","            Hegemonic masculinity took over the US and feminists were fighting for equal rights on the basis of sex. In the midst of this political tension, Tom DeFalco presses for a character of justice, masculinity, womanizing, and heroism of full amelioration, found in none other than the friendly neighborhood hero, Spider-Man. The political realm of equal rights was battling a threat and the face of masculinity that was in charge was being opposed by a mass movement. Spider-Man’s supposedly old-and-improved characterization is an agent of protection against the threat of femininity and, more specifically, feminism and gender inclusivity. In fact, based on a study about the embodiment of superheroes done by Dr. Edward Avery-Natalie, “evolution toward hyperbolic forms has been increasing since the Golden Age of comic books” (Avery-Natalie 81). Furthermore, male characters can be, as it is typically found in this study, fetishized to embody the fullness of male power that is depicted through masculinity of said character (Avery-Natalie 80). The article in <em>Amazing Heroes</em> includes sketches for the upcoming Spider-Man, captioned by DeFalco that he’s bringing back lots of “hoo-hah and shenanigans to spider-man” (<em>Amazing Heroes</em> 58). “Hoo-hah and shenanigans to spider-man,” is repeated throughout the story. The sketches detail the muscular, intense, action-packed, violence-packed fight scenes that Spider-Man takes action in. Penciled by Bob Hall, these scenes are exactly the fun and invigorating graphics that depict ideal masculinity: “children live in a historical period, undergoing political, economic, social, cultural and technological changes; those changes are so complex that boys and girls are confronted with many different experiences, which lead them to criticize certain hegemonic values” (Silva 526). In addition to Sylvia’s claim, the call to criticize hegemonic values is accompanied by the exposure to hegemonic values. Comic readers can see masculinity and other historical contexts via this article, especially the want for hyper-masculinity in the time that it’s patriarchal power is being threatened by the strive for greater equal rights.","            Under the new Reagan presidency, the Equal Rights Amendment struggled to get momentum for ratification and the push for more hegemonic, hyper-masculinity was on the forefront for America and in comics. Tom DeFalco’s re-vamping of Spider-Man shows how masculinity plays a large role in the construction of comics and the urge for patriarchal power to take control in America."],"locations":[{"id":52950,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2598,"tag":"Comic"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":1771,"tag":"masculinity"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"},{"id":3576,"tag":"ERA"},{"id":3577,"tag":"Spider-Man"},{"id":3578,"tag":"Amazing Heroes"}]},{"id":6809,"title":"Japanese Influence in American Comic Art","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"12/1/41","end_date":"12/31/90","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beyond racist caricatures, Japanese influence in American comic books did not explode until post World War II. Though Japanese characters appeared as racialized villains before the Pearl Harbor bombing of 1941, racist depictions exploded in war comics after the attack [1]. This hatred left Japanese characters consistently portrayed as “ghastly yellow demons... or buck toothed little monkeys with oversized spectacles,” but never resembling humans [1]. During this time when Japanese individuals were viewed largely as dastardly villains, influence from Japanese existence on comic books mainly existed as overt racism.","While the rise in tensions during World War II led to increased depictions of Japanese characters, often this representation was far from positive. However, after World War II, the influence of the Japanese, particularly manga, grew to have a diversified effect on American comic books. From serialization to magazines like Giant Robot to the rabbit samurai Usagi Yojimbo and other anthropomorphic fighters, the influence of Japanese culture and creators has since extended into the consciousness of American comic book culture. While serialization had not been an asset of the European comic book scene, serialization plays a massive role in Japanese manga, which accounts for approximately a third of all Japanese publishing [2]. This influenced came into the United States to affect not only alternative comics, but the wider total market of long-form comics, including graphic novels [2]. All together, the popularity of graphic novels in the United States can be at least partially contributed to the popularity of English translations of Japanese manga [2].  ","Even more notably, post World War II “story manga” contributed to the rising popularity of animal-warrior comics, such as Usagi Yojimbo and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles [3]. This movement of alternative comics largely affected the West Coast of the United States, which stands as a massive site for Japanese immigration. Likewise, Giant Robot, magazine published in the 1990’s discussing Asian American and Asian culture, particularly in California, proves again the rise in popularity of Japanese popular culture in the print. One figure in such Japanese-inspired comics, Usagi, a samurai rabbit created by Stan Sakai and first appearing in 1984 [4], also appeared on the cover of the fanzine Amazing Heroes Issue 187. Within the issue’s interview with the Japanese-born creator, Sakai cites connection to Japanese culture through his art and coloring and also fights for historical accuracy within his story [5]. While the character started as a simple eight page story in another magazine, he eventually ended up with his own black and white comics, regular comics. Usagi also makes guest appearances in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or TMNT, world. TMNT was created by two American creators in 1990, and Usagi’s appearance in this American-made cartoon allows us to argue for Sakai’s and Japanese culture’s influence on the two creators beyond the turtle’s “ninja” title.","Therefore, though the influence of Japanese culture and the representation of Japanese characters in American has expanded in post World War II era with the advent of story manga and alternative comics, the cultural representation still has imperfections."," "," "],"locations":[{"id":53143,"lat":34.9592083,"lng":-116.419389,"zoom":8,"place":"Southern California"}],"tags":[{"id":2629,"tag":"Manga"},{"id":3575,"tag":"Japanese Culture"},{"id":3580,"tag":"Alternative Comics"},{"id":3581,"tag":"Japan"}]},{"id":6811,"title":"Double- Consciousness: Defining and Skewing Black Superheroes","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"10/6/18","end_date":"10/6/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s-70s defined the decade and marked it as the most progressive era to date. With the marches, protests, sit-ins, etc. America saw huge steps towards a more fair and free country for African Americans. With all this being said, there was still the underlying disconnects between how black people defined blackness and what white America defined as blackness. The comic book culture at this time can clearly be seen following this same pattern in relation to racial representation, usually doing so in problematic and condescending ways. The 60s-70s saw the introduction of many black characters such as the Black Panther, Luke Cage, etc., who were in all honesty, lackluster and riddled with stereotypes. Consider the Black Lightning, whom was portrayed as donning an Afro wig and speaking slang. In this case, the hero is defined by his blackness as opposed to his substance. Many comics representing black characters, including this one, are interesting though in that their disguises shed light on this idea of double-consciousness, meaning that black people always look at themselves through the eyes of others. In this way, it is almost inevitable that these characters would be flat because, though the world was progressing, black people were looked at through predominately white American eyes who struggled with only seeing what they wanted to see. Black superheroes found some freedom in their powers though. Luke Cage, who possessed super strength and impenetrable skin is made more powerful in the fact that he is not just a common man—he is capable of bigger and better things than what someone would assume just by looking at him. This was a way to challenge what many white supremacists considered “the real” lives of black people, which they defined in their own, skewed terms. These comics, though admittedly underdeveloped and stereotypical, still help show its readers that black lives are not definable by white eyes. Instead, the increase of black characters in comic books allowed for a deeper understanding of their lives. Literature representing black characters allowed for many readers to finally get a glimpse into the complexities of black lives, which white Americans had been ignorant to for years. This knowledge represented in literature, including comics, ranged from male/women relations, gender roles, parenting, etc. Obviously, this is a plus, but not even this could make black comic book characters of the 60s-70s progressive enough. This is preciously what Keith Henry Brown, in his article “Growing Up Black Reading Comics”, argues in <em>Amazing Heroes</em>. These black characters introduced in this era simply weren’t progressive enough. Characters such as Luke Cage and Black Lightning were only defined by the fact that they were black and the stereotypes that plagued them counteracted most steps they took toward progressivism. These characters could have been something, but not simply just because they were black, which is what comics were only able to define them as at the time. In all, the 1960s could have been extremely progressive, but the country was changing rapidly and its citizens still hadn’t caught up to seeing black people outside of their mostly white eyes. The culture was trying to see black people as separate, powerful entities, as evident by the introduction of black characters, but this outlook still clouded them and made them end up rather stereotyped. Progressivism is tricky and non-linear, but over time it can and will seep into the country culture to be consumed by all."],"locations":[{"id":53144,"lat":44.3148443,"lng":-85.6023643,"zoom":8,"place":"Michigan, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":629,"tag":"race"},{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":3579,"tag":"double conciousness"}]},{"id":6812,"title":"Sex Sells: The Hypersexualization of Women in Comics","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/91","end_date":"1/1/95","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1990s, there was an extreme influx of violence and sex in comics. In <em>Amazing Heroes #191</em>, released in June 1991, science fiction, fantasy, and horror writer, Adam-Troy Castro, wrote a review of a series of sex comics. This publication problematizes the majority of these comics for their lack of substance and oversexualization of women. Many of the comics are completely degrading and have no clear story line. Though many of them are written to sell and earn a profit, they are incredibly distasteful and offensive to many.","In <em>Comic Book Nation</em>: <em>The Transformation of Youth Culture in America, </em>Bradford W. Wright explains, “The comic book industry suffered some shock in the mid-1990s… The biggest problem is the transformation of American culture itself” (Wright 283-84). As the United States modernized, television, video, computer games, etc. were popular and “comic books simply could not match.” This suggests that the contemporary world seemed to outgrow comics. There were so many different avenues that consumers could enjoy, rather than just reading a comic.","Leading up to this collapse of the industry, was a time of complete oversexualization of females in comics. At this point, the Comics Code Authority lost power and the industry focused on writing for more mature audiences. Brigham Young University’s Kyra Nelson writes, “The ‘90s was a particularly notable decade in comics for impossible body proportions with very few clothes to hide them…These women were so impossibly proportioned that, had they been real, they would have tipped over if they had tried to stand up” (Nelson 4). These images caused consumers to have an incorrect image of what women really look like. In this tough time for comics, writers utilized the oversexualization of women as a selling point for their comics in order to keep the industry alive.","      Females also had a complete lack of power in relation to their male counterparts in comics. In a journal on Feminist Criminology, Tammy S. Garland, Kathryn A. Branch, and Mackenzie Grimes discuss stories of rape in comic books. They write how, “This oversexualization of comic characters coupled with the sexual violence perpetrated against them reifies rape myths as they are ‘cultural artifacts that contribute to the cultural construction of hegemonic masculinities’… As a result, the path to justice is determined by a patriarchal system that determines ‘who’ may be the hero and what type of person maybe the victim” (Garland, Branch, & Grimes 6). This indicates that having females constantly playing victims rather than heroes reflects the patriarchal society in which we live. It glorifies males as powerful and dominant, while females are perceived as weak without control.","      In Castro’s article, in <em>Amazing Heroes #191,</em> he discusses a comic, <em>Revelry in Hell,</em> by Ron Wilber in which females are portrayed as victims to their male counterparts. He writes, “This is a book where women are chained, whipped until they’re raw, threatened with branding irons, and pictured both before and after having their eyes poked out, all for supposedly erotic effect” (Castro 89). A description like this causes one’s stomach to turn. The fact that someone decided to write a comic for male pleasure that is completely violent towards women is problematic in itself. It is completely distasteful, and again portrays females as the victim, while males are dominant. This indirectly suggests that extreme violence towards a woman for sexual pleasure is okay. However, in reality it is harmful and objectifies females.","In the 1990s, there was a comic book crisis along with an extreme rise in violence and sex in the media. With this, female characters were completely oversexualized and objectified. Sex was used as a means of gaining profit in the industry and females had little to no power over their male counterparts. This was a very dangerous time in society because women were perceived as lesser and weaker than males. Despite this, it is absolutely crucial to criticize these comics and their portrayal of women so that one can have a greater understanding of the social injustices that are hidden within all types of media during this time."],"locations":[{"id":53145,"lat":47.7827941,"lng":-120.9263262,"zoom":4,"place":"Seattle, WA"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":364,"tag":"sex"},{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"},{"id":3582,"tag":"Hypersexualization"},{"id":3583,"tag":"Victim"},{"id":3584,"tag":"Power"}]},{"id":6813,"title":"The Transformation of Transmedia: The Influence of Outside Media Tie-Ins in Comic Books","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/87","end_date":"10/1/87","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Comics themselves are influential enough to serve as their own form of popular media. However, in issue #126C of <em>Amazing Heroes</em> titled “Millenium,” there’s an emphasis placed on popular culture outside of comics themselves. One short article in the beginning of the issue, titled “<em>Captain Eo</em> Hits Stores in August,” brings a music star into the comic world. An ad for a comic adaptation by Tom Yeates of a 3D film starring Michael Jackson that could only be see at Disneyland and Epcot Center, the book was predicted to have extensive reorders due to Jackson’s massive popularity. ","The idea of bringing Jackson, a megastar, into comic books supports the concept of transmedia. According to Henry Jenkins, transmedia is defined as “storytelling [that] represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience... the strategy may work to draw viewers who are comfortable in a particular medium to experiment with alternative media platforms,” (Jenkins par. 2 and 6). It’s often used in the comic world, being that superheroes would debut in print and make their way to other platforms like radio, television, movies, physical merchandise, and more.","Transmedia in comics became crucial when World War II was emerging, mainly through the means of incorporating Superman into radio propaganda. Being the first superhero, Superman was, arguably, the most popular of them all. Seeing his success in the printed comic world, it was figured that he could prosper in other media platforms as well. On February 12<sup>th</sup>, 1940, <em>The Adventures of Superman </em>radio serial aired, only a few months after the first propaganda film for World War II emerged. Appearing on the Mutual Broadcast System, Superman was depicted fighting more villainous, real forces— affiliating himself with pro-American wartime imagery as a result. Serving as its own form of transmedia, “propaganda, in effect, was a form of advertising, enabling media messages to flow more freely across the borders of media. Both the strategies of producing interlinking narratives in the Superman comics as well as the character’s new construction as propaganda had involved many of the same industrial configurations, with both concerning the production of a flow of adjoining content across media—urging those who had purchased Superman already to purchase Superman again,” (Freeman par. 14). By using Superman in propaganda-like radio shows, the superhero found success in an audio format as well as print by fighting the “real” enemies of the American people. In turn, people would trust him more, and buy more of his comics as well.","Carrying into the 1980s, transmedia was used in “<em>Captain Eo </em>Hits Stores in August.” Through using Michael Jackson, the world’s most famous pop star at the time who appeared in several other media tie-ins like the 1978 film <em>The Wiz, </em>along with Pepsi commercials, <em>Amazing Heroes</em> knew that bringing him into their comics would not only increase their sales, but bring in readers who previously hadn’t picked up their comics. Not only was incorporating Jackson beneficial to them, but to Jackson as well, being that “it [was] necessary to develop new strategies, codes and narratives that brands and artists [were] creating to connect with consumers. Music [was] the basis of the collective experience and, in addition, it connect[ed] intensely and emotionally with the identity of groups that [were] its potential target,” (Sánchez-Olmos and Viñuela 11). Though he already had ample exposure, Jackson hadn’t been included in the comic book world before, giving him a new audience of people.","            Though popularized within the comic’s industry in World War II due to Superman transitioning to radio, transmedia proved to be popular in the industry long afterwards, incorporating a powerhouse musician into a print format to increase sales and draw in new readers."],"locations":[{"id":53146,"lat":42.7353595,"lng":-84.4831298,"zoom":11,"place":"East Lansing, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":2589,"tag":"Superman"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":3585,"tag":"Transmedia"}]},{"id":6814,"title":"Misrepresentation and Sexualization of Women in Comics and Media in the 1970s-'80s\nBy Miranda Kalinowski","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/90","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Heidi MacDonald’s article, “House of Semi-Raging Women”, written in the <em>Amazing Heroes</em> series focuses on the skewed, sexist representation of women in comics in the 1980s. This article was written in a time where there were only a limited number of female comic book writers because it was believed that women aren’t as skilled at writing about/drawing superheroes as men (MacDonald). Although MacDonald notes that comics written in the ‘80s were less sexist than they were in 1970s, they’re still notably sexist, mentioning that it’s “like saying now that Stalin is dead and can’t send people to labor camps in Siberia, how things have improved in Russia” (MacDonald 21). One reason MacDonald lists for this misrepresentation is the fact that there are not many female creative writers, so the way that female comic book characters are being portrayed is sexist and based on a man’s views of how women should look.","            This touches on the social/political issue of women not being in control of their representation in the media, instead having a man decide how to portray her. Because women’s portrayal in comics is being controlled by men and primarily distributed to men, women are represented in a way that feeds into the sexualized/fetishized views that men hold of women. Jeffrey Brown adds to this problem of misrepresentation in his book, writing that “The highly sexualized visual representation of contemporary action heroines is a prominent aspect of how they are marketed and packaged for potential viewers/consumers” and that “This eroticized promotional style is important because it marks the point where action heroines are offered up as objects for male consumption” (Brown 20-21). Because the comic book audience is mostly male, male writers believe that portraying female comic book characters in a sexual manner is exactly what these young readers want to see.","            In his review of Aaron Diaz’s Wonder Woman, another author, Philip Smith, further stresses this problem surrounding gender misrepresentation in comic books. Not only does he agree with the fact that women in comics are sexualized, but he also points out how they’re highly idealized: “Diaz makes Wonder Woman exceptional rather than representative. She is not an Amazon, or even a human, but a golem. Rather than being designed as an inspiration for women … she represents a clearly unachievable ideal” (Smith 8). This is another problem that women must face in the comic book world; not only do they see themselves being portrayed in a way that sexually appeals to men, but these portrayals are highly unachievable, which can lead to body dysmorphia.","            However, not only are women being misrepresented in comic books during this time, but also in films. Andrea Wright, a member of the Department of English and History at Edge Hill University, examines this problematic representation in her article about the female body in action/adventure cinema. In this film genre, women are weak and feminine, and their only purpose is to be saved by a big, strong man, rather than doing any saving or fighting herself (A. Wright). This suggests that the only reason women exist in these ‘80s movies in the first place is because the male heroes need something to save; they’re not included because they’re meaningful characters with their own strong, heroic storyline.","            This essay engages with this discussion of female misrepresentation and misuse in media by getting insight about this subject from many different sources. The sources used support the idea stated in MacDonald’s <em>Amazing Heroes </em>article about the lack of women’s input in character creation leading to sexualized and idealized characters, rather than characters with a meaningful storyline. While there had been an increase in the number of female characters in comics between the 1970s and ‘80s, they are not being given an accurate representation. As Bradford Wright notes in <em>Comic Book Heroes, </em>it seems that the main reason for their existence is to be “targeted more at adolescent male lusts”, providing further reasons to sexualize women (B. Wright 250). Today, female superheroes are becoming more independent, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to fully eliminate the fetishization and misrepresentation of women in media."],"locations":[{"id":53144,"lat":43.765087,"lng":-84.8209346,"zoom":6,"place":"Michigan, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3586,"tag":"Women, comics"},{"id":3587,"tag":"misrepresentation"}]},{"id":6815,"title":"Superheroes in the Modern Era: How Print Icons Became a Big Screen Phenomenon","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"10/8/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1980s were full of new superhero movies; from <em>Flash Gordon </em>to <em>Batman, </em>the decade was full of new takes on characters that were often up to half a century old. In Gary D. Robinson’s article “Of Kids and Comics III”, in <em>Amazing Heroes </em>issue152, he tackles the contrast between what schoolchildren of the late ‘80s thought of superheroes and what he observed as a child. It addressed the difference between comic book culture and superhero movie culture, focusing primarily on how children are more and more associating the characters with films rather than comic books. This essay examines the more contemporary relationship between comic books and their film counterparts, focusing on the elements that caused a shift toward a movie-dominated superhero industry, both then and now.","The transition from comic books to films began in large part with the motion picture serials of the 1930s and 1940s (Mcallister et. al). This success, combined with a rapidly growing movie base, was the catalyst for where these films are today. It was easier to justify making movies about well-beloved characters than unknown ones, and as movies at the time were still relatively new with an uncertain future, there was less of a reason to start from scratch. Despite this early start, superhero movies did not really pick up until the 1980s.","            While the 1980s are generally associated with upbeat music and bright colors, that is not fully indicative of the times. The Cold War was still a threat, and nuclear war seemed like a possibility every day. In the early days of the Cold War – the mid-1950s – superhero comic book makers tried and failed to revitalize the print industry, with youth instead flocking to EC’s crime and horror comics as a way of combating the uniformity of their generation (Wright 135). Once an end was in sight to the Cold War, many filmmakers began to turn to flashy, kind-hearted superheroes to symbolize American hope and distract from the dismal reality that many felt, despite the characters often being put in darker scenarios than in the comics (as demonstrated by Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em>).","In this article, Robinson also addresses growing cultural issues, like illiteracy and an America-wide preference for cinema over reading, and how he feels this is harming society and, more importantly, the academic growth of children. The focus, however, is primarily on children recognizing superheroes less as a comic book fixture, and more as a movie staple. With a sharp increase in superhero movies in the last fifteen years ago, this trend is decades-old and not likely to die down any time soon.","Michael E. Uslan, an executive producer for the 1989 <em>Batman </em>film, offered three reasons as to why the superhero movie genre has taken off in the last two decades: technological advancements (better digital effects), cultural traumas (like 9/11), and utilizing a pre-existing fan base to procure immediate interest (Burke 23). These three reasons were all relevant in the 1980s, when Robinson’s article was written, but are even more relevant today, particularly with the increased popularity of fan events, like Comic Con. It is also an effect of the political events in each period – the Cold War in the 1980s and 9/11 in the early 2000s.","Joseph Michael Sommers’s take on the growth of the superhero genre shares some similarities with Uslan. Sommers believes that the 9/11 terrorist attacks heavily affected the genre, and Americans’ need for someone powerful and in control, even in entertainment. This similarity to the Cold War’s effect on the superhero movies of the 1980s speaks to the growing relevance of comic movies over comic books in popular culture.","This growing relevance is entirely why this essay is needed. Robinson’s article was written thirty years ago, and little has changed; in fact, the superhero industry has gotten even closer to being film-based than it was back then. This essay engages with the shift of superheroes from print to film primarily by examining cultural events that affected the popularity of both medias and their respective contents, along with the work of credible scholars. To understand superheroes’ relevance to contemporary culture, it is vital that we examine the medias in which they appear."],"locations":[{"id":53147,"lat":42.7179089,"lng":-84.5539748,"zoom":7,"place":"East Lansing, MI, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":1539013571,"tag":null},{"id":3588,"tag":"superhero, comic, books"}]},{"id":6816,"title":"Issues Within Issues: A Meta-Analysis of Wonder Woman's History","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/89","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Much can change in the seemingly endless lifespan of a comic book hero, and as the culture surrounding a character's pages shifts, heroes adapt to stay relevant. “Improving the Amazing Amazon” of the 56th issue of the fan magazine Amazing Heroes contains fan advice for improving the DC superhero Wonder Woman as the writer of the series changes. In providing advice, the fan, Lon M. Rovner, additionally asserts a critique of Wonder Woman's development over time. Consequently, Rovner delves into problems with Wonder Woman that display a lack of complexity, particularly with the series's villains, causing a rift between Wonder Woman and the male superheroes she intends to exceed and exhibiting further problems that emerged with crafting a superhero after WWII.","Aware of the impacts of WWII on the stories in comics, Rovner asserts that Wonder Woman struggled after the war, citing the cause as the heroine's concept changes and weak villains after the Nazi threat was eliminated in comics (Rovner 55-56). Not unique to Wonder Woman, the loss of an international threat greatly affected the villains presented in superhero comics. Assuming that “the meaning of both Superhero and Supervillain depends upon a mutual negation” (Pitkethly), a change in supervillains corresponds to a change in superheroes, and without a major supervillain prevalent throughout Wonder Woman's consistently altering history, the default adversary becomes petty, low-threat criminals. Determining Wonder Woman's identity, then, becomes dependent on these simplistic criminals, and as a heroine who was intended to, according to William Marston, her creator, be “propaganda for the new type of woman who should, [Marston] believe[s], rule the world” (Knight), Wonder Woman should make an impact on readers. She does not meet Marston's expectation if comic fans see her as less than male superheroes because of her lack of complexity and lack of identity. Before accounting for the fan requests such as Rovner's, Wonder Woman misses her chance to overcome patriarchal dooms that both entice the audience and send the (somewhat) feminist message that Marston attempted to craft.","    Gladys Knight examines Wonder Woman's feminist origins, explaining that the comics initially held excerpts of women's accomplishments, intended to teach readers (especially boys) about powerful women (Knight). However, Wonder Woman was created by a man to educate predominantly boys, was scripted predominantly by men, and did not utilize a female artist until Trina Robbins worked on the Legend of Wonder Woman mini-series in 1986 (Cronin). This perspective reinforces the female existence as seen from a male lens like that described by comic writer Marguerite Bennett (who explains that men often depict women as they see them in male spaces) (Skye), and binary roles are reinforced by the “othering” of Wonder Woman described by scholar Clare Pitkethly in which the heroine is presented as on the cusp of masculinity and femininity (Pitkethly). Wonder Woman's strength masculinizes her instead of being a part of her. Considering the male dominance involved, Wonder Woman's feminist roots do not fit with a feminism to which all fans (particularly female fans) can relate. Rovner's exclusion of this dominance may provide further insights into what was and was not discussed by male fans about gender in comics.","    Conclusively, without the development of Wonder Women, her supporting cast, and her supervillains after WWII, many fans saw a need for change. This call for further development (and, ironically, a call for a return to Wonder Woman's roots) brings into question the intentions of Wonder Women as a character and the ways in which she has been able to achieve these visions, as well as how they have changed with the culture around the comics."],"locations":[{"id":53149,"lat":40.1434317,"lng":-89.5397361,"zoom":6,"place":"Illinois, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3591,"tag":"Feminism in Comics"},{"id":3590,"tag":"Fan Studies"},{"id":3589,"tag":"Wonder Woman"}]},{"id":6817,"title":"The Call for Creative Rights from Siegel and Shuster to Scott McCloud","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/75","end_date":"0000-00-00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","In February of 1982, the eighth issue of the periodical <em>Amazing Heroes</em> reported on the implementation of a new royalty program at DC Comics. This program was said to benefit the creative teams with an increased allotment of their comic’s revenue after sales passed a certain threshold (McConnell, 15). It was meant as an incentive for these authors and writers to produce more elaborate, exciting material, with Frank Miller’s best-selling take on <em>Daredevil</em> as an example to follow. The program seems fine enough, encouraging more interesting work, providing a powerful monetary incentive for authors, and even prompting Marvel to exercise a similar scheme. The backdrop for this program, though, tells a darker story: this era of comics, more so than the previous decades, was characterized by a wave of authors demanding that their rights be maintained, their success be reflected in their paychecks, and their characters be respected.","            Seven years earlier, Warner Bros. announced a feature adaptation of DC Comics’ Superman, prompting a deliberate and powerful rant from the character’s co-creator, Jerry Siegel, who stated in a press release, “The publishers of Superman comic books, National Periodical Publications, Inc., killed my days, murdered my nights, choked my happiness, strangled my career. I consider National's executives economic murderers, money-mad monsters” (Kaye). This was not the first of the duo (Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster) actively seeking greater compensation for the creation of the world’s first and most recognizable superhero, and it was not the last, either. While the success of the revamped <em>Daredevil</em> comic was cited by DC’s managing editor, Dick Giordano, as the chief reason behind their sudden focus on creator’s benefits and compensation, it is not difficult to see this incentive as a move calculated to avoid another pesky creator demanding their dues.","            Then, in 1988, six years after the DC royalty program (making it sort of like meaty center of a delicious copyright sandwich), an elaborate document was penned by a gathering of comics creators at Northampton, Massachusetts, among them Dave Sim (<em>Cerebus</em>), Michael Dooney (<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>), and Richard Pini (<em>Elfquest</em>). According to one of its more well-known co-authors, the document was not a major upset to the comics industry, but “an interesting snapshot of our attitudes at the time, and of the climate that was fueling self-publishers, progressive business people, and artists trying to reinvent the comics industry” (McCloud). It detailed very carefully the full extent of creative control that an original author had over their characters and properties, and it was clearly fueled by the wrongdoings of the publishers who had taken control away from them.","This era of comics was defined by its creators more than ever before. These authors had seen their characters mangled, mistreated, or propagated everywhere without input, and their new diplomacy coerced publishers into allowing them, if nothing else, more compensation for exceptional service. The DC royalties program was one of many exercises of that period that featured authors and illustrators, inspired by the creative freedom of alternative comics, demanding that their work be valued."," "," "],"locations":[{"id":53148,"lat":42.3250896,"lng":-72.6412013,"zoom":7,"place":"Northampton, MA"}],"tags":[{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":3592,"tag":"Creators' Rights"},{"id":3593,"tag":"DC Comics"},{"id":3594,"tag":"Royalties"}]}]}
