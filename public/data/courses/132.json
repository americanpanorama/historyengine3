{"id":132,"title":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school_id":71,"school_name":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","term":"Fall 2014","abbr":"HIST 319","url":"","description":"American social, cultural and political life underwent dramatic transformations during the period between the end of the Civil War and the end of World War II. Americans’ understanding of freedom, democracy, rights and responsibility evolved in significant ways, leading to a profound change in America’s national identity and international image. The forces that led to the emergence of modern America were both destructive and creative. Disruptions of all kinds reshaped Americans’ relationship with the natural world, the built environment, and the economy. Dramatic shifts in the nation’s demographic composition, fostered by emancipation, immigration, education, urbanization, and industrialization reshaped Americans relationships with one another. Everything seemed new –the new immigrants, the new woman, the new Negro, a new and more expansive federal government. All of these forces led to the establishment of a new kind of “average American life,” one that was more diverse, more urban, more educated and more mechanical than ever before. For many Americans, the “novelties” of the era inspired great optimism, encouraging excited reform of nearly every aspect of American life. For others, such rapid and profound change inspired fear and a sense of bitter nostalgia, spurring movements to control and temper social change. The journalist Walter Weyl captured the mood of this period in his book, The New Democracy: \"America to-day is in a somber, soul-questioning mood. We are in a period of clamor, of bewilderment, of an almost tremulous unrest. We are hastily revising all our social conceptions. We are hastily testing all our political ideals. We are profoundly disenchanted with the fruits of a century of independence.\" This class explores the ways in which Americans were revising their social conceptions and testing their ideals between 1877 and 1945. Many of the conflicts and contradictions faced by the Americans who witnessed the rise of modern America continue to resonate in public discourse. Our emphasis will be on the social and cultural dimensions of American life. We will have an opportunity to explore the extent to which individuals and coalitions were able to affect social and cultural change and to influence policy and political discourse. We will also pay attention to voices of dissent and disillusionment. We will ask questions about the impact of political, economic and social turmoil on everyday life. We will seek to understand why the expansion of democracy and freedom is so often met with violent resistance. We will arrive at a deeper understanding of the experiences and beliefs that shaped everyday life in America.","points":[[39.3048367775,-76.6274800611],[39.2338595038,-76.3925904773],[38.8324772244,-76.8447330303],[39.087394033,-76.4791169961],[40.6127984981,-75.5924733112],[39.2464830538,-76.5960396412],[37.9285902233,-75.8346527629],[39.5358347431,-76.0898051386],[39.603674835,-77.8141711851],[39.6214880132,-78.6989494063],[39.4722539212,-77.3980976361],[39.2712597428,-76.5709760837]],"bounds":[[40.6127984981,-75.5924733112],[37.9285902233,-78.6989494063]],"episodes":[{"id":6249,"title":"The Baltimore Jewish Educational Alliance and the Emerging American Jewish Identity","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/09","end_date":"12/31/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1916, just before the fourth of July, the Baltimore Sun ran an article praising the Baltimore Jewish community for their Americanism. The article stated, “[a] Great Many of us are discussing at present the meaning of Americanism and what constitutes a real American, but our Jewish fellow-citizens have no doubts on the subject. They have grasped the idea in all its fullness, and they have made it a part of their supreme creed.” The cause of this article was the annual July fourth party thrown by an organization known as the Jewish Educational Alliance.","As new immigrant communities arrived in the United States between the 1880s and 1924 they felt immense pressure to integrate culturally into American life. Baltimore’s Jews responded to this pressure through organizations like the Jewish Educational Alliance. These Jews embraced Americanism so dearly because they came largely from Germany, Russia, and Eastern Europe. In these countries, they had spent the last half-century struggling to even be given the ability to be recognized as citizens.  In contrast, the promise of freedom and equality in America --even though America rarely lived fully to its promise-- was an attractive alternative. Jewish immigrants were eager to becoming citizens.","German Jews began to settle into Baltimore's neighborhoods in the 1840s and by the 20th century had integrated into American life quite well. However the late 19th century brought a new wave of Jewish immigrants to the United States largely from Russia and Eastern Europe. The German Jewish residents of Baltimore had largely assimilated into American life north of Baltimore by the time the Eastern Europeans began arriving. These new immigrants moved into the south Baltimore neighborhoods where the German Jews had once lived. German Jews began to worry that the new immigrants would reflect poorly on the already established Jewish community in America, damaging their hard earned status.","In response to this fear members of Baltimore's German Jewish community established The Jewish Educational Alliance in 1909. The organization was designed to help uplift the Russian Jewish community. The JEA offered classes in English, Citizenship, and naturalization. in 1911 <em>The Baltimore Sun</em> ran an article praising the young organization for its succesful social programs.","The Jewish Educational Alliance was succesful in accomplishing its goal of Americanizing Baltimore's Russian Jews, but just as importantly the JEA created a place where Baltimore's Russian and German Jews could be together. This physical mixing of the populations built a new generation of American Jews."],"locations":[{"id":51922,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1664,"tag":"Jewish"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":1715,"tag":"German"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":2494,"tag":"Russian"},{"id":2495,"tag":"Yiddish"},{"id":2496,"tag":"Citizenship"},{"id":2497,"tag":"Americanization"},{"id":2573,"tag":"New Immigrants"}]},{"id":6251,"title":"Women Workers at the Glenn L.

With many men overseas in the military, women were called on the help the war effort by taking on nontraditional roles including industrial jobs. This was especially the case at the Glenn L. Martin Plant in Middle River, Maryland. The Glenn L. Martin Plant built many of the bomber planes used by American and British forces during the war. Because the production at the Martin plant was so crucial to the war effort, the company began recruiting women from across the country in 1942 to keep production running during the war. Women flooded into to Baltimore for the opportunity to work at the Martin Company.","The influx of women workers created many challenges in the community. There were increased demands for housing and for services to help women new to the area find help with childcare and other domestic duties.  In some ways, the community and the company responded well. The Glenn L. Martin Company created female dormitories first, and more substantial housing projects later, so that women workers could live nearby. To help support women, the company provided inexpensive child-care which included regular check-ups by nurses. Recreation was also in demand. The Glenn L. Martin company established recreational clubs for women, including the Minta Martin Girls Club. The community responded, too. Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church established a USO for the plant workers. The church also sponsored events and classes.","However, not all of the women's needs were met without a struggle. Recognizing their importance to the war effort, women were able to insist upon some important services. For example, at first, workers' children were not accepted into the public schools because of over-crowding. In response, they acted collectively, threatening to quit their jobs and slow the war effort at the plant. The federal government had to step in, providing financial support to enable workers' children to attend Victory Villa School.","At first, Martin employers were hesitant to hire women claiming that they would be a distraction to men. However, they quickly discovered that women workers were a tremendous asset to the overall production at the plant, and they made accomodations that were unusual in the history of women's homefront activities. In other areas around the country, child-care established by war industries or in neighboring communities was too expensive. Many women were forced to rely on neighbors or older children to take on the responsibility of daycare. Unlike at Glenn Martin, women in other industrial plants also had to struggle to provide health care and healthy meals for children. Further, the commuting times for women in other cities could be quite long, expanding the amount of time they were away from home.The women at the Martin Company were paid that same as male workers, but the same cannot be said about women in industrial jobs elsewhere.","Because of the importance of the Martin Plant, due to location and what they produced, they were able to do a lot more for their women workers. Even though the women at the Martin Company still faced hardships, the company and the support of the community eased some of these hardships allowing the women to really thrive and help with the war effort."],"locations":[{"id":25547,"lat":39.2338595038,"lng":-76.3925904773,"zoom":9,"place":"Baltimore, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":2571,"tag":"Homefront"}]},{"id":6252,"title":"<strong>The Creation of the Patuxent Research Refuge</strong>","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/34","end_date":"6/3/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Patuxent Research Refuge by Executive Order 7514 on December 16, 1936. The Refuge was officially opened in June, 1939. It served as both a conservation and a research site for the federal government. Its creation is an example of two of the primary objectives of the New Deal: longterm conservation of natural resources to help prevent future ecological disaster and immediate relief for the unemployed.","Rexford G. Tugwell was responsible for the creation of the Patuxent Research Refuge. As Undersecretary of the Department of Agriculture, he recommended the protection of roughly 2600 acres bordering the shores and tributaries of the Patuxent River. Tugwell argued the site was otherwise unsuitable for farming or development. Mr. Ira Noel Gabrielson was Head of the Biological Survey Head, and he helped Tugwell realize the potential of the Patuxent Reserve. Gabrielson survyed the area on August 14, 1935. He found the site to be diverse in both biological specimins and in natural environments. Patuxent Superintendent, Dr. Leland Morley, praised Gabrielson's ability to recognize that “specialized wildlife investigations could be carried on under the guidance or leadership of our country's foremost scientists [near the nations’s capital].”","The development of the Refuge helped meet the New Deal goal of work relief and training. New Deal funds paid a variety of laborers to study and develop the site. Civilian Conservation Corps workers readied the land for research and implemented a variety of conservation strategies.","The Patuxent Research Refuge helped preserve America’s wildlife and indirectly aided in addressing the problems of poverty and unemployment by putting men to work in conservation.

In response, progressive reformers designed a modern approach to solving problems: conducting research, identifying potential solutions, and then lobbying for reform. Women were often in the forefront of efforts for reform.","The need for more efficient and effective methods to address medical epidemics led to the creation of the Johns Hopkins school of nursing in 1889. Isabel Adams Hampton Robb was appointed as the first head of the nursing school. She became highly influential in revolutionizing the field. Previously considered work for the lower classes, Robb and the School of Nursing helped raise the work to the status of profession. She insisted upon rigorous training methods. She is credited for influencing the establishment of many nursing organizations including the American Nurses Association, the National League for Nursing, and the International Council of Nurses. These associations worked to popularize the new standards instituted by Robb, thus improving the status and privileges for nurses and women in the field throughout the entire nation. In 1976, nearly 70 years after her death, Robb's name was recognized in the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame.","Robb's contributions to nursing lead Johns Hopkins University to become one of the pioneers in not only medical advancements, but in women’s rights. Women were finally being allowed access to appropriate secondary education, as well as a more prestigious profession. Robb's theories and contributions were extremely beneficial to the Johns Hopkins school of nursing, which in turn set new standards for the nursing profession on a national scale. The Johns Hopkins school of nursing was perhaps the birthplace for many ideas responsible for attributing higher standing to the female dominant profession."," "],"locations":[{"id":37967,"lat":39.2338595038,"lng":-76.3925904773,"zoom":9,"place":"Baltimore, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"},{"id":2579,"tag":"Women's Professions"},{"id":2580,"tag":"Middle Class"},{"id":2581,"tag":"History of Medicine"}]},{"id":6257,"title":"Standarization of Fire Hose Couplings:  Outcome of the Great Baltimore Fire","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"2/7/04","end_date":"7/7/12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Everyone is familiar with the myth of Mrs. O’Leary’s cow who kicked over the lantern and started the Great Chicago Fire.  Far fewer are familiar with the story of the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. A cigarette and not a cow was rumored to have caused the destruction. More important than the causes are the outcomes. The Baltimore Fire of 1904 led to important change in fire safety equipment. Urban fires were a common and devastating occurrence throughout the United States. They created great fear and anxiety, and each led to calls for meaningful reform. The Great Baltimore Fire was no exception.","On February 7, 1904, at midday, a small ember sparked in a warehouse in downtown Baltimore.  This tiny ember sparked and fueled a fire that lasted thirty hours. Baltimore was not prepared for a fire of this magnitude.  Buildings, including fire-resistant structures, were damaged by the heat and flames. Firefighters had to combat high speed winds, and extinguishing the flames proved more challenging than anticipated.  Newspapers articles reported that neighboring cities sent firefighters and equipment to help battle the blaze.  Unfortunately, these legions of firefighters were often unable to use their own equipment, because their coplings were not compatible to Baltimore City fire hydrants.  This  wasted time and might have prolonged the blaze. But it also helped motivate reform. Within two months after the fire, legislative bills and conferences were held to standardize fire hose couplings.  Cities expressed an interest in finding methods to make their city safer.","Interest in fire safety reform lasted into the early twentieth century.  Magazines, such as the <em>Quarterly of the National Fire Protection Association</em>, explained the importance of standardizing fire hose couplings, referencing the Baltimore fire as valid reason for his reform. Numerous cities replaced their fire hose couplings relatively quickly and efficiently. While the Great Baltimore Fire devastated the city, it lead to new methods of fire safety and reform that is essential to present needs in keeping the public safe."],"locations":[{"id":51922,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2519,"tag":"Baltimore fire 1904 MD"},{"id":2538,"tag":"Fire Safety"},{"id":2566,"tag":"Urban Reform"}]},{"id":6254,"title":"Revenge is Sweet: H.

During the late 19th century, women's organizations took on temperance as a domestic issue, using it as one of the many reform efforts that justified their activism outside the home. When Progressives took up the cause in the early 20th century, partly out of anit-immigrant sentiment and partly out of concern about decadent public culture, the movement achieved new levels of success. This success culiminated in the passage of the 18th Amendment banning the manufacture and distribution of alcohol. But many Americans and political leaders opposed Prohibition, and calls to end the ban began almost as soon as the new law took effect.","Prohibition in the United States during the 1920s was a constant source of debate and drove criminal activity. Reporters like Baltimore, Maryland's H.L. Mencken wrote constantly about its negative effects. He was among the many Americans who called for its repeal. Mencken, a writer for the Baltimore Evening Sun, was a vocal opponent of the 18th Amendment. He wrote countless columns devoted to the repeal of the 18th Amendment in hopes of bringing about Prohibition’s end.","After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Mencken not only celebrated, he dedicated columns to the exciting news. On April 7, 1933, Mencken was photographed at the Hotel Rennert in Baltimore, Maryland cheerfully accepting and then downing his first public glass of post-Prohibition beer. In his autobiography, published several years after Prohibition, Mencken told a number of  Prohibition stories. His command of language caused the reader to be giddy with laughter one second and fearing for Mencken’s life the next. For example, when asked if he was a federal agent, Mencken replied, “Where did you ever see a prohibition agent who looked so innocent, so moony, so dumb?” Later,  recounted an incident in which he lost his booze to tough looking theives.","H. L. Mencken’s influence on the American people did not dwindle with Prohibition. In fact, using his passion as a driving force, he spoke against the unfair treatment during the First Red Scare as well as injustice acts taken towards African Americans. Mencken used his dedication to get, not only the people of Maryland, but all Americans to expand their views on the changing world around them."," "],"locations":[{"id":23178,"lat":40.6127984981,"lng":-75.5924733112,"zoom":9,"place":"Lehigh, Pennsylvania"},{"id":23153,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":10,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":600,"tag":"Media"}]},{"id":6275,"title":"The Lynching of George Armwood","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"10/18/33","end_date":"10/30/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 18<sup>th</sup>, 1933, George Armwood was arrested and later lynched for the alleged attack of an old married white woman named Mary Denston. Lynching, commonly practiced throughout the United States from the 19<sup>th</sup> century until the 1960s, was a method of murder used to control African American behavior. The victims were typically accused of inappropriate behavior towards white women, though historians agree that these charges typically were false. Armwood’s case met with something highly unusual of Maryland lynchings up unto this point: gubernatorial intervention.","Gov. Albert Ritchie had ordered that Armwood be moved out of Somerset County to Baltimore for protection until his trial. However, relentless pressure from the whites in Princess Anne pushed Judge Robert Duer to transport Armwood back to Somerset County, where an angry mob waited for him. The mob broke through the guards and used a telephone pole to batter down the jailhouse door. The mob rampaged the jailhouse, found Armwood, and dragged him to the courthouse lawn where they beat him severely. They then dragged him through the streets into Duer's neighborhood, where they hanged him from a tree near the judge's home. Afterwards his mutilated body was set on fire and abandoned in a lumberyard where it stayed to terrorize the African American community.","Politically, Maryland was sharply divided over issues of race. In general, Baltimoreans identified more with northern progressive thought while residents of rural areas held to southern sensibilities. With the gubernatorial election on the horizon, Gov. Ritchie found himself torn between rural white segregationists on the one hand, and urban progressives and African Americans on the other hand. Baltimoreans were enraged by his refusal to take responsibility for Armwoods' lynching. In response, Gov. Ritchie declared that, “The responsibility for Armwood's being at Princess Anne rests squarely on the shoulders of Judge Duer and State's Attorney Robins.” Ritchie’s reluctance to use his power to administer justice seemed to demonstrate a broader unwillingness to improve the rights of minorities and promote a progressive agenda. In order to recover his reputation in this demographic, Gov. Ritchie sent three hundred National Guardsmen to apprehend four of the men accused of the Armwoon lynching and bring them to Baltimore for trial. This ultimately failed because Somerset residents actively rebelled.","Ritchie’s short-lived attempt to prosecute the lynchers alienated White segregationists and his ambivalence about the lynching of Armwood had infuriated African American and white progressive voters. He lost reelection. Interestingly, the Armwood lynching was the last in Maryland. That, combined with the voters' actions, suggest that Maryland politics was turning toward Civil Rights during the 1930s."],"locations":[{"id":23153,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":10,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"},{"id":24915,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"Somerset, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2540,"tag":"George Armwood"},{"id":2539,"tag":"Gov.

At that time, there were two national organizations for women’s suffrage at the time the Maryland chapter was formed:  the National Women Suffrage Association and the American Women Suffrage Association. While both had the same goal of achieving full voting rights for women, they tended to have different arguments and different tactics. The NWSA, headed by famous suffragette Susan B. Anthony, wanted a constitutional amendment granting voting rights for women in every state. The AWSA favored state-by-state change. Eventually, in 1890, both organizations combined to create the National American Women Suffrage Association, which approached women’s suffrage as part of women's traditional role. Women should vote, they argued, so they could \"clean up politics.\"","Maryland was one of the first states to have a state suffrage association, and Maryland activists were rather distinct from those in the national organizations. By the turn of the 20th century, Maryland's suffrage leaders were not only demanding the vote, they were making a strong case for women's independence and professionalism. Emma Maddox Funck became President of the Maryland organization in 1904. Funck and her sister were accomplished and independent women. Emma Funck had created a name for herself in the music world. She graduated from the Peabody Conservatory of Music of the Johns Hopkin’s University in Baltimore, Maryland. However, rather than focus on her musical career, she joined the Baltimore Suffrage Club and the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1894 to become a full time activist. Her sister, Etta Maddox, was also a suffrage and women's rights activist. Etta Maddox had also attended the Peabody Institute, but she eventually switched from singing to law school. On June 6, 1901, Etta Maddox was the first woman to graduate from the Baltimore Law School. Although 37 other states allowed women to take the bar, Maryland did not. Etta Maddox fought for the right of women to practice law in her home state. She lost a case in the Maryland courts, so she pursued it as a federal issue. Under pressure from Etta Maddox and a group of her peers, the Senate passed a bill on March 4, 1902, establishing a federal right for women to practice law. The House passed a similar bill on  March 31, 1902.","Despite such strong, feminist leadership, the women in the Maryland Woman Suffrage Association faced many obstacles. Their agenda was diverse. In addition to demanding access to the vote, they also fought for co-education, and equal pay for equal work. Ironically, even after passage of the federal woman suffrage amendment, women in Maryland still had a fight ahead of them. The state did not ratify the Suffrage Amendment.

Imagined as a way to provide them with some financial support in their older age, Congress agreed to pay the bonus in 1945 --nearly thirty years after the end of the war. However, by 1932, veterans of the war were feeling the impact of the Great Depression very sharply.Walter W. Wathers left Portland, Oregon, with a few hundred men, determined to march to Washington and demand immediate payment of their promised bonus. The march eventually included 20,000 veterans and their family members. Their protest was peaceful and orderly, but it failed. Under orders of the President, they were expelled from Washington. Three Marchers were killed during the protests.","With the death of their comrades still fresh on their minds, many of the Bonus Marchers simply returned home. Waters was determined not to give up, however. While many veterans abandoned the fight, some remained with Waters. They continued their effort to continue to convince the American government that their plight demanded immediate action.","Violently expelled from Washington, DC, Waters began to search for another place his army could call home. Johnstown Pennsylvania extended an offer, but Waters declined. He wanted to set up his troops in  area closer to the “front,” and Maude Edgell offered Waters a wooded plot in Laurel, Maryland.","Waters set about to create a new encampment there, where his fellow veterans could not just continue to occupy in protest, but also live in a self sustaining community. Several hundred veterans gathered at the sight to begin preperation for the settlement. Waters met with the Mayor of Laurel to discuss these plans.","Unfortunately for Waters, politicians were not finished refusing the Bonus Army. Maryland's governor at the time, Alan Richie, delcared the site unsuitable for such a large settlement, insisting that the land was not appropriate for farming and that the lack of water and infrastructure were insurmountable.","With yet another defeat, the bonus army wandered off in to obscurity. Several hundred of the former marchers died in a hurricane. Their final defeat was a mass cremation.

First, Lithuanian “cutters” employed by wholesalers of fabric worked in warehouses to form the parts of coats—the sleeves, the collars, and so on. Next, these parts were moved to the sweatshops that teemed in the neighborhood bounded by Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue on the north and south, and Central Avenue and Broadway on the east and west.. There, men operating sewing machines assembled the parts into coats. Finally, women working by hand finished the coats. The owners of these sweatshops, like almost all the sewing machine operators and seamstresses, were Jews from Poland.","Since 1886, the men working the sewing machines and the women finishing the coats had each had their own union, first as part of Terence Powderly’s Knights of Labor, and then beginning in 1891 in the United Garment Workers, affiliated with Samuel Gompers’ American Federation of Labor. In these early days of American labor, disputes among unions were frequent, and the AFL had split off from the Knights only a few years prior in a major schism. And while the Jewish seamstresses and sewing machine operators had switched to the AFL, the Lithuanian cutters remained Knights. Soon after joining up with the AFL (which was far more strident than the Knights), the members of Baltimore’s UGW locals began to circulate their demands. They wanted a ten-hour workday instead of twelve to eighteen. They wanted to be paid every week, instead of whenever their bosses got paid for finished coats. They wanted year-long contracts, instead of ad-hoc employment. And they wanted everyone working in the shops to be a member of the UGW, with a UGW representative coming by regularly to ensure that workplace conditions were suitable.","The employees of the shops discovered that the owners were going to complete their current orders and then lock the union members out. So the UGW (with the assistance of national secretary Henry Reichers) preemptively went on strike on June 30. Approximately one thousand tailors and seamstresses shut down over thirty sweatshops. Within a week, a third of the “sweaters,” as the shop owners were known, had given in and agreed to operate their shops on union terms. In fact, the strike may have been too successful. Days later, the sweaters formed their own union, the Monumental Tailors’ Benevolent Association. The MTBA was advised by (though not yet aligned with) the Knights of Labor, who were staunch competitors against the AFL. The Knights, who were already affiliated with the Lithuanian cutters, pressured the sweaters not to give in to the demands of the Polish Jewish tailors and seamstresses. Now, instead of each sweatshop owner dealing with the union on his own, the Association was dealing with the UGW. The MTBA tried to convince the male tailors, who led the UGW negotiators, to abandon the female seamstresses, but were rebuffed by a strong show of solidarity. Despite this new stumbling block, the UGW and MTBA hammered out the framework of an agreement by early August. Only one problem remained.","The MTBA, on the advice of local Knights leader J. G. Schonfarber, insisted that the restriction of employees to membership in the UGW be changed to membership in any labor organization, including the Knights of Labor. The UGW, frustrated by the turn negotiations had taken, decided that they would go back to dealing with individual employers, which had worked so well just a month earlier. The MTBA responded by formally joining the Knights of Labor as the Monumental Coat Contractors’ Association. It now became clear to most of the seamstresses, tailors, and sweaters (who themselves were not wealthy or powerful men) that their local dispute had been hijacked by the rivalry between two major national unions. They had been better off before the Knights of Labor ever intervened. By October, almost all the striking workers had returned to the shops. The sweaters employed them on the union’s terms, even without a formal agreement between the union and the shops. The strike had ended when the owners decided to come to terms with their fellow Polish Jews rather than maintain the interests of the Lithuanian cutters or participate in the squabble between the AFL and the Knights of Labor."],"locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":156,"tag":"Labor Strike"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1664,"tag":"Jewish"}]},{"id":6268,"title":"Aberdeen Proving Ground Creating a Local Impact","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"10/20/17","end_date":"7/15/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["World War I impacted millions of people and their environment. After hostilities erupted in Europe in 1914, the United States maintained an official stance of neutrality. But American industry recognized an opportunity, and provided a variety of supplies to warring nations. The German strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare made neutrality impossible, however. The United States declared war on Germany in 1917, and the federal government entered into the business of military supply.","Six months after the official declaration of war, the federal government purchased over 35,000 acres of land in Harford County, Maryland. The War Department contracted with the Maryland Dredging & Contraction Co. for construction and Aberdeen Proving Ground opened in October, 1917. The facility was used for designing and testing ordinance material. The construction of the Proving Ground had a profound impact on the local community. Population increased dramatically, and workers and locals alike demanded new services.","Transportation services became a priority for both locals and workers. On November 1<sup>st</sup> 1917 Mr. James Buckelew requested a railroad track extension so that workers could travel directly from Baltimore to the Proving Ground. Work to extend the tracks began on December 20<sup>th</sup> 1917. Unfortunately, the new line was not complete until  July 15<sup>th</sup>, 1920, well after the end of the war.","The population increase also created opportunities for new businesses in Aberdeen. Recreational facilities were particularly in demand. The Aberdeen Amusement Company constructed a theater that became an important social space for locals, workmen, and soldiers alike. The Aberdeen Amusement Company was the only theatre in the Aberdeen area, so it was  important to everyone. Sadly, on a cold winter night in February of 1918, the Odd Fellow Building, located right next to the theatre caught fire and caused severe damage. The reconstruction of the buildings took over three years, but the theatre was rebuilt and renamed “New Theater.\"","Aberdeen Proving Ground created a local impact for the town of Aberdeen.

An African American man, Armwood, had had some encounter with an elderly, white woman the previous day. Mary Denston had been walking down the road from the post office. She claimed to have been attacked. Such accusations were deadly for black men. Regardless of the true nature of Armwood’s “attack” on Denston, a posse of over a thousand gathered and stole Armwood from the town jail. They lynched him, burning his body, and leaving him smoldering in a lumber yard. He was discovered early on October 18<sup>th</sup>. In the history of lynching it is evident that the mainstream media fueled the kind of fear that justified racial violence. At the same time, the black press was crucial in drawing attention to the prevalence of injustice and instrumental in pushing for  change.","Racial bigotry did not die with the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. Whites relentlessly continued to implement new means for upholding a misguided social hierarchy once they no longer had the institution of slavery to justify their control of black people. Lynching emerged as a method of control, demoralizing and terrorizing black people to discourage them from protesting injustice. This was one of many ways they were kept as second class citizens.","Journalists in the George Armwood case began to use the media to press for change. White newspapers tended to downplay racial unrest, at least until the  early 20<sup>th</sup> century. They emphasized African American crimes in order to create an image of a people not suited for free society. By 1933, white newspapers had begun to report more frequently on crimes <em>against</em> African Americans. They were not interested in activism, however. Rather, the tone of most articles was informative and the focus was local. This made it difficult for readers to understand lynching as a systemic problem.","The Baltimore Sun took this approach in the Armwood case, reporting the details of the lynching without raising questions about the response of local officials or police. Armwood's jailers had lfailed to protect him, and he never had the benefit of a trail. The Sun did not make these points clear. Further, The Sun attempted to soften the atrocity, for example, by referring to the posse’s contempt for pleas for peace as “good natured.”","The black press took a much more activist approach. In Baltimore, reporters for The Afro American expressed outrage. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, African American newspapers became key players in advancing the cause of civil rights. No longer would African Americans stay silent under the chains of oppression. Instead, they would become more vocal and more insistant – a role that The Afro played beautifully. Reporters reminded the public that George Armwood had been tortured before his body was burned, that he was a son of a mother distraught with grief, that this event was a travesty and a flippant disregard of the justice system. A new juggernaut of media style began to take form as it walked a nation into an era of social freedom.","Media holds the power to shape nations. White journalists failed to question the long reach of  slavery into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Black journalists propelled a movement for change. Every form of media has a cause: to remember this and to understand where it is leading us will open a window to escape the cycle of history.

Roosevelt. The task was simple:  “rapidly build simple cargo ships to carry troops and material to allies during World War II.”","The demand for war ships came in response to the dominance of German U-boats during early part of World War II. In an effort to gain American support to join the war effort, Franklin D. Roosevelt made a radio announcement on May 27, 1941 about the danger of German domination. The President said, “there have been sinkings of merchant ships in alarming and increasing numbers by Nazi raiders or submarines.” Roosevelt said only two things had prevented Hitler from accomplishing world domination: “epic resistance” by Great Britain and the “magnificent defense of China”. He believed the Axis Powers could never achieve world domination without first gaining total control of the seas. Roosevelt argued that the United States could stop Hitler by working to protect the seas.","Before construction of warships could begin to move forward rapidly, new shipyards had to be built that could handle a large number of vessels. The Emergency Shipbuilding Program created 18 new shipyards. One of the first shipyards was the Bethlehem-Fairfield shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland. Bethlhem-Fairfield proved to be one of the most important during the peak of World War II. It built \"a basic, no-frills cargo ship designed for capacity and rapid construction as opposed to speed and grace.” These ships carried food, war materials, and other items to benefit the soldiers. They came to be known as the “Liberty Fleet”. Bethlehem Fairfield built 384 Liberty Ships, a feat that distinguished them as one of the most effective shipyards during the war.","Even though wartime merchant ships were constantly beseiged and destroyed during the war, they were replaced in total before the end of 1943 because of fast production by American shipbuilders. The best shipyards could build and deliver the 441 foot Liberty Ship vessels in just 16 days. Prior to the implementation of the Emergency Shipbuilding Program, production of a single vessel required 244 days.

Once farmers were moved off of poor landscapes, the agency sent in conservation experts to reclaim and improve the land. The Resettlement Administraion also oversaw the creation of model communities, designed to serve as examples of how people could live more harmoniously with the environment. The towns highlighted the necessity of green space and public transportation and emphasized the value of cooperative living. The Resettlement Administration worked with over 200 existing rural and suburban communities and actually designed three entirely new towns before the agency was dissolved.","Greenbelt, Maryland, was one of the three towns planned and established by the Resettlement Administration. Established in 1937, Greenbelt attracted unemployed and impoverished people who wanted to make a new life for themselves and were willing to be active civic participants. One citizen of Greenbelt in the early years said first inhabitants felt like pioneers working in uncharted territory. Their enthusiasm for the Greenbelt project showed itself in the creation of numerous cooperative organizations within the town. Within the first ten months, Greenbelt’s civic-minded inhabitants had founded twenty-nine clubs and organizations.","Despite this enthusiasm of the residents in the foundation of Greenbelt, there was a disappointing trend toward racial exclusion. The town originated as an exclusively white community. The only hint of diversity was the presence and acceptance of Jewish residents. The original plan for Greenbelt called for a segregated black section, the Rossville Rural Development. Officials quietly dropped the plan and later justified their decision by explaining that African Americans had their own low cost housing in Northeast Washington.","Racial inequity was a persistent problem in the New Deal, and the Resettlement Administration Programs were no different.The racial exclusiveness of Greenbelt was not unique.

These men focused on dangerous and unhealthy conditions and believed that raising awareness would help change conditions. Dr. Arthur P. Herring, secretary of the Maryland State Lunacy Commission, took a similar approach to help reform care for the insane. in August of 1908, at the height of the Progressive Era in the United States, he photographed conditions in Maryland asylums.","From the 1870s on, Maryland had many reports about the poor treatment of the mentally ill, but politicians had done little to improve conditions.  Herring was on a mission. He visited all of the asylums in his state, photographing each one. His aim: to provide visual evidence of the bad conditions in which the mentally ill were housed. He gathered twenty-six photographs on the subject.  Dr. Herring’s pictures showed overcrowded institutions where patients were sleeping on the floors of rooms with barred windows, and other unsanitary conditions.  He argued that patients were treated more like prisoners in jails rather than people who needed serious care, and he presented his findings to Governor Austin T. Crothers on October 6, 1908.","Dr. Herring focused in particular on the Montevue Asylum in Frederick County during the Commission’s meeting on October 28, 1908.  This asylum had been praised for its “exemplary” conditions in previous years. However the conditions that Herring photographed raised serious questions about that. In fact, it was one of the worst.  Herring traveled around Maryland, presenting his findings to various groups, including private practitioners. In Baltimore on January 20, 1909, the State Lunacy Commission opened a three-day exhibit at Johns Hopkins University’s McCoy Hall.  There were speakers, slide shows of the images, and even a band playing as the public mingled about.  Here the public and the press were enlightened of the treatment of the mentally ill in their state to their shock and horror.  Was this truly the way that their wonderful state took care of these poor people?  The public did not want outsiders to think that they were cruel citizens of Maryland.","Dr. Herring kept up his photographic campaign into 1910. He was successful. The government in the state of Maryland started to make changes by proposing and passing legislation to reform the mental system conditions across the counties.  It did not come without obstacles, and in his path to get reform, Herring had opponents of reform that tried to block the passing of legislation, but ultimately reform was meant to happen and it did by a landslide."],"locations":[{"id":51922,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":849,"tag":"Progressive Era"},{"id":2107,"tag":"Social Reform"},{"id":2534,"tag":"Mental Illness"},{"id":280,"tag":"Maryland"}]},{"id":6276,"title":"Women Workers at the Bethlehem Steel Mill in Sparrows Point, Maryland","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/42","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A significant part of the development of modern America can be attributed to the rise of the steel industry. Henry Bessemer developed a faster method to manufacture steel in 1864, reducing the production time from seven days to thirty minutes.  Bessemer’s work was revolutionary.  After that, steel was quickly integrated into modern society.  At the end of the Civil War, top railroad executives formed a steelmaking company that would incorporate the Bessemer process.  Steel enabled a giant leap ahead in technology, as it was much more resilient in comparison to traditional iron. Steel can be attributed to the massive expansion of railroads across the country.","In March 1887, surveyors arrived in Sparrows Point, Maryland to determine a suitable location for a steel mill.  One of the biggest steel companies in the eastern district, Pennsylvania Steel, purchased the peninsula on the Chesapeake Bay and broke ground in the following summer.  Upon its completion, more men began working at the mill, and their wives and children followed and lived in the surrounding area of Sparrows Point.  The U.S. Bureau of Labor called Sparrows Point “the most noteworthy example of a complete steel community, planned, constructed, and controlled by a steel company.”","The steel industry was a man’s world – incorporating intense heat and heavy equipment that naturally shut out women from the job -- as it drastically contributed to the masculine pursuit of expansion and modernization of America.

Together, they created networks and relationships that became the framework for a new free community afer the end of the Civil War. Maryland freed all the enslaved people in the state in 1864. But the state provided little else to aid black people in defending themselves against unfair and violent treatment in the aftermath of the war. Although it was exempt from Reconstruction, the number of complaints about black people in the state encouraged the Freedman's Bureau to expand its activities into the former border state.","In the meantime, black people began to establish their own institutions to provide protection and support to the community. In Washington County, Maryland, newly freed black families joined their free brethren in launching new religious societies and educational institutions. They were able to take advantage of land and other resources held by free people as the basis for building a new and bigger community. In each community, the black church was the central institution. Reverend John R. Tolson founded Tolson’s Chapel  in Wasihngton County. Samuel Craig, a free black man, had acquired the land.It became the spiritual and educational center of a vibrant community of black families. The keystone for the chapel was laid in October 1866.","Tolson’s Chapel served the African-Community in many ways. It the center of an active community, holding services and Sunday school, fairs, festivals, and meetings.It served as a school and a community center as well as a place of worship.

Armwood had been accused of assaulting an elderly white woman. Enraged, a mob refused to wait for Armwood to be tried.  His murder was just one in a long list of lynchings perpetrated by whites against African Americans. These murders were committed to assert white supremacy and instill fear. African American organizations and leaders worked to pass a federal anti-lynching law for decades, but their efforts failed to attract the necessary support.","By 1933, opposition to lynching was growing, however. Progressives called for an investigation into the Armwood murder. Governor Albert Ritchie complied and expressed hope that the leaders of the mob might be apprehended. However, Ritchie's choices made that hope unlikely. He put Judge Robert F. Duer in charge of the investigation. Duer had gotten word that Armwood was in danger, but he had not  acted to stop the mob. Meanwhile the majority of whites on the Eastern Shore of Maryland remained uncooperative with authorities. They believed the lynching was justified and considered the leaders of the mob to be heroes.","Even after suspects were identified, Judge Duer refused to make any arrests. He said there was insufficient evidence. In response, Governor Ritchie declared martial law in Somerset County and dispatched state police and 300 National Guardsmen to make arrests in its surrounding areas. Four of the nine alleged mob leaders were arrested and a new mob came to protest the arrests. They attacked authorities and tried to free the suspects. Despite this, the suspects were safely tansported to Baltimore for trial. Ritchie received a number of death threats as well as intense criticism from the state legislature, who felt he had acted without regard for the law. For whatever reason, only one day after the arrests were made, Ritchie handed the case back over to Judge Duer.","On January 24, 1934, the Somerset County Grand Jury refused to indict the men. They decided there was a lack of evidence to bring charges against any of them. The four accused were  were released to an overjoyed crowd. The failure to bring Armwood's murderers to justice showed how little progress had been made towards equal rights in Maryland and exposed a flawed justice system that made decisions based on race. After the disappointment of the Armwood case, African American leaders and newspapers pushed even harder for endorsement of federal anti-lynching laws, bringing the movement to national attention. This along with new state protocol to transport all arrests of African Americans for crimes against whites to Baltimore ensured that George Armwood's lynching would be Maryland's last."],"locations":[{"id":24915,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"Somerset, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"},{"id":119,"tag":"racial violence"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}]},{"id":6282,"title":"Children Working in Berry Fields in Maryland in 1900s","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"7/8/09","end_date":"7/8/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the early 1900s, child labor was common.

The National Child Labor Committee was composed of politicians and citizens who were concerned about the effects of child labor on children.

Wives and mothers often managed the day to day expenditures within families and those in the newly reduced middle class adapted and reframed the economic decisions that they made. Women living in towns and cities dealt with their new money problems and simultaneously struggled with the stigma attached to talking about financial problems and the need to keep up appearances. Since personal help and advice on how to save money remained somewhat taboo, women found help in the Women’s sections and household maintenance columns in local newspapers. Through these columns women managed to build a wide reaching but anonymous support network.","These columns ran before the depression but after the economic crash they too adapted and reflected the economic needs of women during the Great Depression. The women’s section of newspapers usually covered roughly two pages and offered a myriad of advice and help to women trying to cut costs. The Daily Mail of Hagerstown, Maryland, ran a weekly Food Market Advice column for women. Information in the column included the rise and fall of prices for local produce and meats and predicted patterns for future prices providing women with needed information for weekly shopping and encouragement to take advantage of local markets. The column also provided meal ideas and menus for the cheapest options. Other articles gave advice about meal plans and offered set prices that they believed could be followed, touting $1.50 or $2.00 plans that could feed large families. Often the advice became extremely detailed. A column titled Sister Mary's Kitchen ran in the Fredrick, Maryland, News. The writer advised women about which cuts of meat cooked the quickest so they might save money on electricity. She noted that the money saved by cooking quickly could be set aside to pay for heating bills. Some columns offered direct tips on how to discretely cut costs so that women could maintain their middle class appearance. These tips ranged from cooking advice --telling women to mix butter and margarine to stretch it farther and hide the taste-- to sewing --advising that dresses could be let down and that ribbon or rickrack could hide the old seams and creases.","Usually these columns were also conscious of the social conventions of the time period and refrained from using terms like “cheap” or “thrifty.” Economical became the standard term used to describe the advice and alert women reading it that they could find advice there. The columns that offered advice also obeyed social conventions by giving women in need of help and advice the anonymity needed to ask. With the help of these columns women managed to navigate their lives and economic choices in the Great Depression."],"locations":[{"id":19072,"lat":39.6214880132,"lng":-78.6989494063,"zoom":10,"place":"Allegany, Maryland"},{"id":19248,"lat":39.4722539212,"lng":-77.3980976361,"zoom":9,"place":"Frederick, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":600,"tag":"Media"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}]},{"id":6284,"title":"<strong>The Desegregation of <em>Maryland's Law School</em></strong>","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"12/1/33","end_date":"1/31/36","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In December 1933, Thurgood Marshall began preparing for his first major civil-rights case. Marshall, having recently graduated from Howard Law School, returned to his native Baltimore to practice law and became legal advisor to the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Marshall was set on fighting to desegregate the University of Maryland Law School – the very same school that had rejected his application four year earlier.","Maryland was seen by the NAACP as a fertile testing ground for cases against segregation. Maryland state law did not require the segregation of colleges and the University had no rules explicitly prohibiting the admission of black students. Only the bias of those controlling admission stood in the way. And this bias could be challenged.","Marshall asked his mentor Charles Hamilton Houston for help. Houston was a Vice Dean of Howard University Law School and special counsel of the NAACP. Houston had constructed a strategy based on the findings of Nathan Margold.  Margold’s research found that institutions had violated the “separate but equal” principle which had been established by <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>. The institutions created for blacks were separate but never equal to those provided for whites. Houston’s strategy to challenge the equality aspect of segregation rather than questioning the constitutionality of segregation itself.","Houston agreed with Marshall assessment of the Maryland Law School. They needed to begin at the graduate-school level and law schools were an ideal target. Lawyers could easily see the absurdity of a “separate but equal” law school. The choice between creating a separate school for colored students and allow the admission of black students was clear.  Additionally, the NAACP also needed a victory for morale.  Houston hoped that through this case he could start pattern of precedents with each victory supporting the next.","While Marshall waited to take direct action, nine black students applied and had been turned down by the University of Maryland Law School. What Marshall needed for his case was a plaintiff.  He found that in Donald Gaines Murray. Murray was an ideal plaintiff. He was black graduate of Amherst College with good grades. Murray’s family was also well respected in the Baltimore area. Marshall convinced Murray to apply to the law school and, as expected, they turned him down. The university officials suggested that Murray apply to the Princess Anne Academy, an all-black school. This academy did not have a law school.","On April 20, 1935, Murray sued the university for denying his application in Baltimore City Court with Marshall as his attorney. The case began in June and was executed swiftly. The university claimed that the Princess Anne Academy offered an equal education opportunity. However, Marshall disproved them and argued that there was no other law school in the country that could teach the laws of Maryland except the University of Maryland Law School. The next day the judge ruled in Murray’s favor. The university did appeal the case but lost.","Following the victory, Houston cautioned “Don’t shout too soon.” The Murray case was only a small opening in the fight to end segregation. The Murray case, while it did not end segregation, was a monumental stepping stone in the road to desegregation.

Both the city and the Railroad Company encountered a challenge in 1904, when the Great Baltimore Fire destroyed the majority of the Financial District.  The thriving company rebuilt its headquarters immediately after the fire, taking the opportunity to present a more modern image.  As transportation by train was becoming less popular and cars were becoming more relevant in society, the company took the opportunity to validate it was still relevant, through the building architecture.","The building itself has a very progressive look inside and out.  According to the Baltimore Sun, it was the richest building in Baltimore with the most up to date design.  This building was meant to make a statement that the company was here to stay and continue doing business.","The construction of the new headquarters caused quite a stir. The Baltimore Sun published an entire article about the design and what it meant for the company.

One of the most significant parts of the building were the sculptures, including “the Roman God Mercury, a mythological symbol of commerce; and a figure called the Progress of Industry”.  The Beaux- Arts design gained popularity during the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.  The connection to the Fair is significant because there, technolgy and the railroad were seen as symbols of American progress.

Considered a ghetto by outsiders, it was a bustling neighborhood of kosher butcher shops, delis, bakeries, bookstores, and Judaica shops. The boundaries of the community were defined by “Pratt Street to the north, Eastern Avenue to the south, Central Avenue to the east, and President Street to the west.” These same boundaries also marked Little Italy. Although many Americans tend to think about ethnic neighborhoods as distinctive. In fact, immigrant communities tended to intermingle, living in close proximity and sharing traditions as well as space.","Aaron Smelkinson remembered a divide between the two communities, one marked by geography as well as culture. “Little Italy was there, but there was a dividing line as if it was a wire fence,” Smelkinson recollected. Milton Schwartz, another Jewish neighbor expressed the same sentiment. “Around the corner was Little Italy,” Schwartz said. “We didn’t mix with them. We’d sneak down there once in a while to get a snowball…but everybody stayed within their own.”","But there is significant evidence that the two communities shared a great deal. On Fridays and Saturdays, Italian children would come over to the houses of their Jewish neighbors to help them heat their homes and turn on their lights (something that is forbidden for Jewish people on the Sabbath). “On Friday nights and Saturday mornings, we would go turn the gas on…they wouldn’t call everybody, just the ones they trusted,” said Clara Rizzi Ferretti, an Italian resident of Little Italy.Other times when Italian shops would run out of certain items, they’d often go over to the Jewish shops and buy from them. Most residents did not have indoor plumbing, so the communities also shared public bathhouses that served as venues for communal gathering.","Though Jewish boys expressed a feeling of animosity coming from Italian children when they’d cross over the street, overall the relationships between these two communities were relatively peaceful. Louis Cedrone of Little Italy commented on the eventual unity that Italians and Jews felt. “It was a mixed neighborhood…It was both Italian and Jewish.” Cedrone also remembered his Jewish neighbors, the Kaplans and the Froms. “The Froms had four girls: Riva and Molly, and Rose, and Mildred. We also had six girls in the family, so they paired off…I thought the whole world was Italian and Jewish.”","Despite the ethnic tensions, the communities generally found ways to work with each other and live harmoniously. The community also had a significant minority of African American residents, as well as other immigrants and minorities.

Advertisers and propaganda agencies created fictional characters such as Rosie the Riveter to inspire women. Advertisements calling on women to support the war effort were widely published and distributed. All of these mechanisms encouraged women to enter the work force. Women answered the call. While women's wartime industrial work is well-known, less well known is the fact that women also engaged in homefront agricultural work by joining the Women’s Land Army.","The goal of the Women’s Land Army was to fill the roles men had left behind on farms while they were away fighting. During the course of the war, the Women’s Land Army had recruited over 1.5 million women to join the homefront efforts. Jean Wanamaker of Bel Air, Maryland, was one of the recruits.

Their windows were smashed, and someone threw a brick high enough to damage the skylight of their three story home. Young boys were blamed for this act of vandalism, but McMechen doubted that a mere boy could hurl a brick to such a height. In July, some female school teachers and a post office clerk soon added to the tally of black residents on the block where McMechen had moved. Their windows were promptly shattered as well.","Fear spread among the white residents of McCulloh Street. They had seen nearby Druid Hill Avenue go from being all white just several years prior to having an overwhelming majority of black residents. White residents feared a sharp decline in property values. McMechen thought this fear was unfounded since other black residents of the street and he were paying more expensive rents than the white people that had dwelled in their homes before them. Still, real estate agents would take advantage of anxious white racists wanting to leave a neighborhood when the first black person moved in. An agent would buy a home at a price lower than the market value and sell it at a profit to a black newcomer. This was an underhanded and now illegal practice known as blockbusting.","McCulloh Street’s newly-formed neighborhood association devised a strategy for restoring the racial homogeneity of the neighborhood that included buying the property owned and occupied by blacks on McCulloh Street. M. Z. Hamer, the black post office clerk, was called upon to have a meeting with the president of the association in order to discuss a potential sale. Hamer refused to sell his house. It was rumored that the clerk became so enraged at the persistent effort of the president to buy his property that he threatened to bash the president with a chair.","With this information of potential unrest at hand, Milton Dashiell, a white lawyer who lived on McCulloh Street, felt he had the ammunition he needed to justify the passage of a law that would prevent blacks from moving into white areas. Citing an old police power provision from the 1796 city charter, he wrote a draft of Baltimore’s residential segregation law of 1910. Blacks could not move into residential blocks with a white majority and vice-versa. The law was passed on December 19, and was the first of its kind in the United States.","When being interviewed by a reporter from the <em>New York Times</em> the next day, Mahool emphasized that the ordinance was not passed due to hostile feelings that white Baltimoreans had for black people.
