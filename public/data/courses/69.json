Kennedy made his bold commitment to land Americans on the Moon by the end of the decade to achieve the ultimate Space Race victory.  “I believe this nation should commit itself to achieve the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth,” stated Kennedy before a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961.  Eight years later, Armstrong and Aldrin were hours away from achieving the late President’s goal.","Beginning with Sputnik in 1957, the Space Race embodied the struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States for superior technology and achievement before their respective nations and a global audience.  Until this point in time, the Soviets enjoyed more success in the race: the first object in space, the first animal in space, the first man in space, the first woman in space, the first spacewalk, and the first orbit were all helmed by Soviet scientists.  The Americans always finished in a close second place.  The Moon landing, however, was America’s moment in the culminating stage of the race, and Neil Armstrong was going to be the hero."," "],"locations":[{"id":31933,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"Harris, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":1025,"tag":"Moon"},{"id":1026,"tag":"Apollo 11"}]},{"id":5257,"title":"<strong>Dr. Timothy Leary Defends Responsible Use of LSD</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"5/1/66","end_date":"5/31/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["By 1966, interest in LSD had proliferated in the public sphere to an enormous extent. The debate over the chemical’s risks and therapeutic possibilities led to Senate subcommittee hearings on its use. Acid, as LSD is commonly called, had been sensationalized by mass media publications and, although in its early years it had been extensively and responsibly studied by medical professionals, the effects of such a powerful chemical remained unclear. Psychologist Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent advocates of LSD, arguing that his medical research of LSD had shown tremendous therapeutic possibilities. However, many Americans remained suspicious of the chemical’s powerful nature. Chairman Thomas Dodd, a conservative Democrat from Connecticut, called for quick measures to stamp out the rapid spread of LSD among America’s youth generation.","In order to gain a better understanding of LSD’s implications, Senator Dodd convened subcommittee hearings on recreational drug use among America’s youth. Leary was one of many expert witnesses called to testify. In his testimony, he asserted that “the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them,” emphasizing the need for further investigation of LSD rather than complete prohibition. Leary also claimed that LSD and many other psychedelic drugs were not dangerous if used wisely and with precautions.","However, his opinion endured aggressive questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who criticized Leary’s testimony as “general hyperbole.” Additionally, the subcommittee chairman cited an earlier testimony by another doctor who argued that LSD encouraged homicidal tendencies and destructive behavior. Leary continued his attempts to placate the committee and remove LSD’s negative associations. When Kennedy asked if LSD usage was “extremely dangerous,” Leary replied, “Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly… Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.” Leary’s testimony urged for some type of licensing that would require LSD users to be highly trained, much like a pilot’s license, so that responsible adults could use LSD “for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.” He also noted that without such licensing, Americans faced “another era of prohibition” that would create a new group of college-educated white-collar criminals. In a later autobiographical work, Leary would claim that Kennedy’s bullying presence was merely an attempt “to gain respectability points by lynching me!”","Leary was one of many experts who testified at the 1966 subcommittee hearings, which showed both ardent support and uncompromising opposition to LSD. Its testimonies marked the conflict between medical professionals, intellectuals, and government officials who struggled to agree on LSD’s meaning as well its regulation. The hearings also embodied the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, which had conservative politicians utilizing acid as a scapegoat and to suppress radicalism among America’s younger generations. Just several months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California. By October 1968, possession of LSD was banned federally in the United States with the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill, marking a tremendous step towards the “War On Drugs” campaign that would arise in the 1970s."],"locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}]},{"id":5258,"title":"<strong>Leary, Metzner, and Alpert Instruct LSD Initiates on How to Achieve</strong> <strong>a Successful “Psychedelic Session”</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/64","end_date":"12/31/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1964, psychologists Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert published <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, a manual intended to prepare the users of psychedelic drugs for sessions. The authors had researched the therapeutic aspects of psychedelic substances, as well as their religious possibilities. The book is heavily influenced by the <em>Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>, (also known as <em>Bardo Thodol</em>) a funerary text that describes spiritual after-death experiences. The authors’ experiments with LSD and other psychedelics began at Harvard University, until unfavorable representations in the press led to the suspension of the research and, in 1963, the dismissal of Leary and Alpert from their faculty positions at the institution. The authors continued their own research, through observation of others and under the influence of hallucinogenic substances themselves.","The text focused on the use of psychedelics with the intention of achieving spiritual enlightenment. The authors devoted Part 3 of their text to an explanation of how to achieve a beneficial experience through proper preparation for a session, noting proper drugs and dosages as well as the critical importance of an experienced “guide.” A guide was expected to serve as a relaxed, secure, and wise presence to help the “voyager” through their trip, “always ready to help navigate their course, to help them reach their destination.” Also important to a successful session was what Leary frequently referred to as “set and setting.” This idea emphasizes proper mental and physical preparation by participants, as well as a suitable environment for the experience. Most significantly, the authors stated that the manual “prepares the person for a mystical experience according to the Tibetan model,” and instructed participants to delay religious interpretations until the end of the session when they could best benefit the individual spiritually.","A significant proportion of those drawn to Buddhism and other Eastern traditions in the 1960s—like Leary, Metzner, and Alpert—were influenced by the effects of psychoactive substances, and vice versa. Reflecting on psychedelic drug use in the 1960s, scholar Richard Batchelor asserts that “it is all too easy either to dismiss claims of spiritual significance for drugs as thinly veiled justifications for hedonistic indulgence, or to invoke the tragic consequences of heedless excess as grounds for denying the validity of any drug-induced experience at all.” LSD advocates were continually forced to defend the legitimate benefits of its use.","The authors of <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, trained in medicine and psychology, were pioneers in the exploration of consciousness and spirituality through the use of psychedelics like LSD. Their research, during the short window of time when LSD was legal, gave some legitimacy to the possibilities of personal and religious development through the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Their work on the spiritual benefits of psychedelics would become even more significant in debates over the use and control of such substances in the late-1960s—debates over one’s right to control their own brain. However, it could not prevent the federal prohibition of LSD in the United States in 1968."],"locations":[{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1009,"tag":"Psychology"},{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"}]},{"id":5260,"title":"Kennedy Hears from a Worried Soviet Premier","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"10/26/62","end_date":"10/27/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between 6:00 and 9:00 PM on the night of Friday October 26, 1962, the tenth day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the members of President John F. Kennedy’s Executive Committee of the National Security (ExCom) received sections of a long, emotional private message from Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev.  Khrushchev revealed the underlying logic of the Cuban Missile Crisis when he wrote, “I see, Mr. President, that you are not devoid of a sense of anxiety for the fate of the world, of understanding, and of what war entails.”  The following day, referred to by Ernest May and Philip Zelikow, editors of <em>The Kennedy Tapes</em>, as “black Saturday,” proved to be the longest and most trying day of the crisis for President Kennedy and the members of ExCom.  Kennedy and ExCom drafted a response in which Kennedy acknowledged that if a solution were not quickly found it would “surely lead to an intensification of the Cuban crisis and a grave risk to the peace of the world.”","Kennedy and Khrushchev attempted to avoid escalation during the Crisis because of the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD.  According to political scientist Donald Snow, MAD was a doctrine formulated by the Kennedy administration that relied on the fact that any state contemplating a nuclear attack on another state with nuclear capability would be deterred from attacking by the knowledge that a nuclear retaliation would cause unacceptable destruction in the aggressor state.  Snow posited that the risk of nuclear war played a major role in decision-making on both sides of the crisis, and that both sides deliberately exploited this risk in the negotiations.","The MAD doctrine may have been one of the reasons why Khrushchev sent his private letter to Kennedy, which according to historian Max Frankel gave the members of ExCom a sense of cautious optimism as they went to sleep on October 26.  It weighed on his mind as he wrote “we are of sound mind and understand perfectly well that if we attack you, you will respond the same way.  But you too will receive the same that you hurl against us.”","Historian Gerard DeGroot quoted Robert McNamara after the crisis in saying that “President Kennedy and I were deterred from even considering a nuclear attack on the USSR by the knowledge that, although such a strike would destroy the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of their weapons would survive to be launched against the United States.”  MAD has been much maligned as a nuclear strategy in the years since the Cuban Missile Crisis, but McNamara argued in 1967, “Assured destruction is the very essence of the whole deterrence concept.”   Both Kennedy and Khrushchev understood MAD as part of the underlying logic for the crisis negotiations."],"locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"}]},{"id":5261,"title":"Surgeon General Fights Prejudice to Provide the Facts on AIDS to the Public","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/84","end_date":"12/31/88","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Timothy Murphy, author of <em>AIDS, Morality, and Culture,</em> recalled that in, “A 1988 report…some 8 to 60 percent of persons surveyed considered AIDS to be God’s punishment for immoral sexual behavior.”  Many of President Ronald Reagan’s closest advisors also felt the individuals who had contracted AIDS were deserving of the plague that was now cleansing the earth of the unfaithful.  Much of the language used to discuss the epidemic was considered to be bedroom language and too taboo to say in public.","Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, charged with writing a detailed report on AIDS for the American people, described the development of AIDS in the US, “AIDS entered the consciousness of the public health service very quietly, very gradually, and with no fanfare at all.”  Even Surgeon General Koop found himself cut off from the deliberations for the first five years of the epidemic. President Reagan’s advisors shielded and isolated the president from the AIDS epidemic.  These individuals kept AIDS at the bottom of the presidential agenda because they felt there was nothing the government could do. However, Roger Higgs argues that the AIDS epidemic brought “greater openness” in public discourse in due time.","Negative stigmatism made it difficult for Koop to approach presidential advisors even after it was proven that it could be transmitted outside of homosexual acts.  The initial term for the epidemic was Gay-Related Immune Deficiency or GRID, in reference to the largest initial group of individuals to experience the disease.  Research proved that it was also transmissible through blood transfusion and heterosexual sex and the name was changed to Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS in 1982.  Despite the lingering social stigma, Koop remembered that the “the first public health priority…stop further transmission.”","The Reagan administration dealt with the crisis in a lackadaisical fashion and restricted Surgeon General Koop from obtaining information. Because of this public health measures for the prevention of AIDS took developed slower than they should have, even as research on the disease was progressing at an astounding rate.  Koop stated “we learned as much about the virus of AIDS in six years as we had learned about the polio virus in the previous 40 years.”  Development of the technology to detect and screen the blood for AIDS contamination was pivotal in the prevention of transmission.","The stigmas surrounding AIDS created ethical concerns for the dissemination of information to the general public.  Koop recalled that advisors to the president were very upset with certain terminology in the report, specifically “penis, vagina, rectum and condom.”  The AIDS epidemic exposed this language, making it mainstream and allowed for easier open and serious discussions about safe sex.  Koop was right when he stated, “at last with that report, the people of the country knew what was myth and what was reality about the AIDS epidemic.”  The American public was in the dark entirely too long, mostly due to the negative stigmas that surrounded AIDS in relation to homosexuality.  Koop fought to balance the need to share information and to please the Reagan administration and mainstream America."],"locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}]},{"id":5262,"title":"Operation Crossroads:  Sailor Witnessed Atomic Bomb Test","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/46","end_date":"8/10/46","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At 0800 hours on July 1, 1946, the United States conducted the Able Test in Bikini Lagoon, the first of three scheduled atomic bomb tests that were part of Operation Crossroads.  Among those who witnessed the atomic bomb test was Joseph Patrick McShane Jr., a nineteen year old sailor from Oaklyn, New Jersey.  From the deck of a transport ship, McShane watched the blast, which was “I think about 20 miles from where we were.”  He was told to turn his back and issued dark cardboard glasses similar to “something you would have at a 3D movie,” as a precaution against the potentially blinding initial flash.  When ordered to turn, McShane spun and saw “the mushroom cloud up in the air.”  According to historian Gerard DeGroot, Operation Crossroads was a U.S. Navy-led project to test the effects of atomic weapons on naval vessels. The tests left many observers unimpressed, but this was most likely due to ignorance about the effects of radiation.","According to the article “The 1946 Atomic Bomb Test” by Lloyd Graybeal, the Navy placed about seventy out of date American and captured Japanese vessels in Bikini Lagoon to test the effects of blast pressure, heat and radiation.  McShane was assigned to one of the target ships, the <em>U.S.S. Lamson</em>, and trained to “get the ship out to the target area.”  In a separate article entitled “Bikini Revisited,” Graybeal explained that the Able Test atomic bomb was dropped two miles from its target and the <em>Lamson </em>was one of only four ships to sink.  Many observers were disappointed by the lack of immediate physical destruction caused by the test, and Dr. Frank Thone wrote in a contemporary article that some journalists described the bomb as “a sneeze in a windstorm” or “just another weapon.”  DeGroot related that the Joint Chiefs Evaluation Board reported afterward that as a result of radioactivity, any ship “within a mile of an atomic bomb air burst would eventually become inoperative due to crew casualties.”","McShane recalled that sailors and scientists were sent into the test area to clean the ships and collect data only hours after the mushroom cloud cleared, with only “coveralls, a hat, and work shoes” for protection. The second or Bravo Test, an underwater atomic bomb burst, caused an irradiated rain to fall on the remaining ships in the test area.  DeGroot recounts that sailors became “violently ill” while attempting to decontaminate vessels with soap and water in the days after the test.  Although McShane never ventured into the test area he saw that “even the scientists, and even the people who carried the scientists around” on small boats “didn’t know what was going on.”  DeGroot wrote that while journalists wrote of the “benign nature of the bomb,” the Joint Chiefs cancelled the third test and abandoned some ships due to the health risk to the sailors.","The scientific, military and media reaction to operation crossroads showed that even after dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, McShane and many who witnessed the atomic bomb tests did not understand the long-term effects of radiation."],"locations":[{"id":26647,"lat":39.9658875933,"lng":-75.1032184193,"zoom":9,"place":"Camden, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":5263,"title":"Scientific Misconduct Prevents Gallo from being awarded Nobel Prize for discovering cause of AIDS","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/83","end_date":"12/31/86","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1983 and 1984, controversy erupted over the methods used in Dr. Robert Gallo’s laboratory at the National Cancer Institute and Dr. Luc Montagnier’s laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in France.  Dr. Montagnier’s lab released an article on AIDS research in May of 1983, but only after Dr. Gallo had peer-reviewed and added his own abstract.  Prior to the AIDS epidemic, Dr. Gallo and his lab discovered the Human T-cell Lymphocyte Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1), a retrovirus under which HIV was also classified.","In 2008, the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded for the discovery of the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), 25 years after the first articles described the virus and the causal link to AIDS.  However, research ethics remained a major concern in the investigation of HIV and AIDS.","However, several factors placed the Nobel Prize just out of Gallo’s reach.  First, Gallo added the abstract, but in doing so he changed the wording to suggest that the newly discovered virus was similar to HTLV-1. Montagnier claims his lab determined the viruses were different.  Second, Gallo received samples from the French and claimed that he was the one who found the virus, and that it was different from the virus the Montagnier found.  Later, it was discovered that the viruses were identical.","Gallo’s claims led to investigations by the National Institute of Health (NIH) ethical conduct committee, but all charges were dropped in 1993.  Montagnier original paper did state, “The role of the virus in the etiology of AIDS remains to be determined.”  One year later Gallo was able to characterize the virus with four separate papers in <em>Science</em>, but the Assembly still deemed that his work was not equal to Montagnier and Barre-Sinoussi’s work.","Likewise, the patent filing for the blood screening test erupted as a dispute, which led President Reagan and French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to declare Gallo and Montagnier as “co-discoverers.”  In 2008, although Gallo and Montagnier shared credit for the discovery, the assembly awarded only Dr. Montagnier and Dr. Francoise Barre-Sinoussi with the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery and isolation of HIV.","Although Gallo was fundamentally involved in linking HIV to AIDS and shared the blood test patent for HIV, the Assembly did not recognize Gallo.  This raises several questions. Did the Assembly take into consideration Gallo’s actions and conduct during initial discovery of HIV?  Why was Gallo not recognized by the assembly, even though he was officially recognized as one of the co-discoverers of HIV?  In writing a piece on the almost Nobel Prize recipient, Jon Cohen describes Gallo, “…once known for his hot temper and fierce competitive streak…he has mellowed a lot, making it easier for him to accept the Nobel Assembly’s decision.”  Gallo’s arrogance and forcefulness may have garnered the title of co-discoverer of HIV and the blood test patents, but did not endear him to the Nobel Assembly."],"locations":[{"id":37862,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":10,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"},{"id":52700,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}]},{"id":5265,"title":"Jacqueline Rhoads copes with ethics as a nurse in Vietnam","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jacqueline Rhoads landed in Vietnam in 1970 at the age of twenty-two.

Moore commanded the 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry which took part in one of the bloodiest battles of Vietnam, Ia Drang Valley, known as the Valley of Death, which started on November fourteenth 1965. The 7<sup>th</sup> Calvary was flown into the valley on a search and destroy operation, after the North Vietnamese attacked a Special Forces base a few days earlier. At the end of the fourth day over two hundred United States Soldiers and over a thousand North Vietnamese Army soldiers had died in combat over the two landing zones.","Using sixteen Huey Helicopters Moore and his men landed at the landing zone called X-Ray at the base of Chu Pong Mountain in November of 1965. After an hour on the ground, the 7th Calvary took fire from the enemy. The men received support fire with artillery at a nearby United States military base and help from bombers and fighter planes overhead. Moore continued to use air support and artillery while his enemy kept trying to overpower him with sheer numbers. However, Moore knew his life line was the Huey’s that were able to bring fresh men and supplies in while taking the wounded back to base. Moore kept the lines open and his men were successful in the end from fending off the North Vietnamese Army after some bloody fighting.","Harold G. Moore has since talked about why he was successful. Leading up to the battle Moore claims “through greater detailed preparations the 7<sup>th</sup> Calvary rose above others, they understood the people, the tactics, and history of the area of Vietnam.” Moore also understood who he was fighting. He had read the history of the French who previously had tried to control Vietnam. Harold Moore followed his principles of conduct during battle in each engagement. He trusted his instincts, was always alert and had no threat of fear. He commented “that a leader must be visible on the battle field, to let his men know he is there with them.” He inspired his men to continue to fight hard. Harold Moore and the 7<sup>th</sup> Calvary won the battle of Ia Drang Valley, and subsequent battles. However, Moore knew at the end of the battle what the Viet Cong were willing to sacrifice and the American military was not prepared for what would ensue."],"locations":[{"id":52685,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":1019,"tag":"\"Harold Moore\""},{"id":1020,"tag":"\"Ia Drang Valley\""}]},{"id":5270,"title":"Levitt &amp; Sons Advertises New Housing Design","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["After receiving much criticism on his first mass-produced, low-cost housing design, the influential post-World War II real estate developer, William Levitt, introduced a new design in 1949.  As advertisements for the new Rancher sprang up across Pennsylvania, many citizens, including veterans who would receive significant discounts, flocked to the Exhibit Center in the Levittown suburbs.  The innovative, mass-produced Rancher, with its “special introductory price” of $8,990, appealed to eager Americans who dreamed of home-ownership.  In an attempt to generate a sense of urgency among potential buyers, the advertisement warned that the initial price was “subject to increase at any time. Those who make application will be protected against any raise.”  With this in mind, Americans hurried to Levittown to secure reasonably priced housing for their families.","The Levittown guarantee of decent, affordable housing lured many eager, young couples to participate in the suburbanization of postwar America.  As historian Joshua Ruff noted, “Patience had been killed by 15 years of economic depression, war and an epidemic housing shortage. People wanted the full package—the affordable house, the new appliances, the suburban lifestyle—and they wanted it right away.”  Levitt & Sons promised this kind of lifestyle to potential customers, deeming Levittown, Pennsylvania as “the most perfectly planned community in America.”  The alluring advertisement also confidently announced, “There is nothing to compare with it anywhere.”  Levittown included the whole package that Americans desired—a sturdy, affordable house equipped with all the necessary amenities to live comfortably while raising a family.  By promoting Levittown as a kid-friendly community, Levitt & Sons urged families to consider the benefits of living in such a peaceful neighborhood.  For no extra charge, as the advertisement clearly acknowledged, Levittown residents could freely access the many recreational areas in the community.  Homebuyers would get all of this at one low cost.  Finally, the American dream of home-ownership had become broadly accessible.","Earlier on, critics had attacked Levitt’s first housing model, the Cape Cod, as a depressingly small and unimpressive structure.  As acknowledged by suburban historians Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, “Levitt took the criticisms seriously and spent between $50,000 and $100,000 to study new housing designs.”  Levitt’s commitment proved essential in improving the earlier design.  Historian Alexander O. Boulton attests to this accomplishment: the new Ranchers “were two feet longer than the earlier models, and they offered as standard features built-in appliances that were only just coming into general use.”  The April 1950 issue of <em>Architectural Forum</em> also addressed the influential and innovative Rancher design.  As quoted in <em>Picture Windows</em>, “‘Never before in the history of U.S. building has one house type made such an impact on the industry in so short a time…builders by the dozens junked their Cape Coddled programs, switched instead to the new Levitt type.’”  It was this innovation, convenience, and affordability of the new Rancher that constituted the major selling points for Levittown in 1949.  The Rancher encompassed all of these elements, thus attracting anxious Americans to the suburbs."],"locations":[{"id":26230,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1010,"tag":"Housing"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"}]},{"id":5271,"title":"Black Family Challenges Racial Barriers in Suburb","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On August 13, 1957, Daisy and Bill Myers moved their family to a well-developed suburb in Levittown, Pennsylvania.  They were just like every other eager newcomer to arrive in Levittown, except that they were black.  As news of this Levittown “first” quickly spread, so did the curiosity.  Drivers continuously circled the house in their automobiles, trying to catch a glimpse of the first African American residents of Levittown.  Other interested citizens gathered near the house to share in their disbelief.  Only hours after the family moved in, violence erupted in the traditionally quiet community.  This “Levittown Incident” was documented in a <em>New York Times</em> article from August 25, 1957, revealing the racism that plagued this sprawling suburban community.  A mere two days after the family had started preparing the house for the move, an angry crowd of 200 residents formed outside the home.  Demonstrators hurled stones at the house, shattering two panes of the picture window.  Police arrived on the scene to break up the crowd.  As Levittown historian David Kushner noted, “It was the first time in twenty-nine years a sheriff had been called in to restore order. But order wouldn’t come easily.”  More disapproving Levittowners returned to the Myers house the next evening.  In fact, as the <em>New York Times</em> reported, “Demonstrations continued almost nightly.”  Time and again, police arrived at the scene to suppress riots.  With the police protecting the house, “An uneasy peace descended on the neighborhood.”  However, the bitter reality of Northern racism remained.","With their innovative mass-production techniques, the housing developer Levitt & Sons helped alleviate the post-World War II housing crisis.  Despite the promise of affordable housing for all Americans, the company excluded blacks from their communities.  “This pattern of racial exclusion was set in 1947,” wrote historian Alexander O. Boulton.  However, William Levitt defended his company’s continued support of racial covenants.  As cited by historian Joshua Ruff, Levitt declared, “‘We can solve a housing problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem. But we cannot combine the two.’”  Thus, Levittown, Pennsylvania remained an all-white community.  “I have come to know that if we sell one house to a Negro family, then 90 to 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community. That is their attitude, not ours,” remarked Levitt in the <em>New York Times</em>.  However, as pointed out in the newspaper, “the builders had no say over the resale of houses.”  This is where the Myers family entered the picture.","In August 1957, a tight-knit, pleasant community became the scene of vicious uprisings.  The riots highlighted the bitter racial tensions of the time and revealed the legitimacy of Levitt’s concerns; Levittowners were not ready to welcome blacks into their community.  As noted by Kushner, Daisy Myers remembered picking up the little culprit that broke her window.  “‘The rock, weighing less than an ounce,’ as Daisy put it, ‘carried tons of hatred with it.’”  Such hatred rocked the town for weeks."],"locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}]},{"id":5272,"title":"Whites Riot in Response to Arrival of First African American Family in Levittown, PA","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Upon driving up to their new home at 43 Deepgreen Lane, Daisy Myers was filled with doubt, recalling that she repeatedly asked herself, “what would be the extent of our ostracism? Would we be able to sleep comfortably?” as she studied the four law officers standing on the lawn of her address in the Dogwood Hollow Section of Levittown. These questions regarding the neighborhood reaction to the arrival of a black family in what had been an intentionally all-white enclave, were unfortunately answered over the next two weeks. At dusk each evening, crowds of people gathered outside the Myer’s home, angrily shouting and jeering, singing the national Anthem, and throwing stones toward the Myer’s home, as apparently these “spacious skies,” they sang of were not meant to be enjoyed in an integrated setting. Levittown police failed to enforce the court ordered protection for the Myers, prohibiting more than three people from assembling near the residence at once. Mobs consequently gathered in this fashion each night, only finally subsiding due to interference from the state police. After an agonizing fourteen days, the riots ended, but the Myers continued to suffer the anxiety of the consequences triggered by the introduction of integration to Levittown. Harassment of the family persisted for almost three months, as Daisy Myers received threatening phone calls of those who “told [her] they threatened to shoot William down on sight,” the family’s deliveries of oil, bread, and milk stopped arriving, and the more than occasional unfriendly white stroller-by forced the Myers to have constant protection, or at the very least, sympathizing company. Anti-segregationist even obtained property immediately neighboring the Myers’ home, using the location to intimidate the family further, evident by their conspicuous display of the confederate flag.","The resistance seen in the August riots against the integration of Levittown, PA was not uncommon throughout suburban neighborhoods. Quite the contrary in fact, racial discrimination and the subsequent segregated communities were the norm in 1950s suburbia. Yet despite this plaguing harassment, the Myers refused to leave their Levittown home, justifiably feeling entitled “to live where [they] chose,” as William put it. Remarking on the family’s incredible determination to outlast their opponents, Dianne Harris, historian and author of <em>Second Suburb: Levittown, PA, </em>stated<em>, </em>“the Myers endured an ordeal that few could have weathered with such dignity, courage, grace, and fortitude.”"," ","This endurance allowed the family to break “the lily-white pattern of Levittown,” as Daisy Myers stated, a pattern that William Levitt had attempted to keep in existence in his planned suburban community. While he did not consider himself to hold racist ideals, Levitt had long refused to sell his homes to African Americans. Applications for home ownership in Levittown had to be made in person at the Levittown Exhibit Center Sales Office, allowing discrimination in the housing industry of the community to readily continue daily. Yet through the assistance received from the American Friends Service Committee, the Myers were able to circumvent these discriminatory practices, making headway in the racial trends of the neighborhood. Yet due to the overpowering ideals of many white residents, in combination with the ideals of Levitt and his employed real estate agents, the effects of the inequality are still seen in Levittown today, as the 2000 census identified ninety-eight percent of the town’s population as Caucasian."],"locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}]},{"id":5273,"title":"Levittown Real Estate Boards' Discriminatory Housing Practices Revealed","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/7/54","end_date":"8/7/54","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article published in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> in August of 1954 journalist Craig Thompson exposed the “problem of Negro exclusion,” commenting on the discriminatory practices employed by Levitt and the preventive covenants established by the local real estate boards within his suburban communities. As the father of modern suburbia, it seemed that with his prepackaged communities, he had also manufactured the ideal enclave for whites opposed to an integrated neighborhood – an enclave that beginning in the mid-1950s, was finally exposed for the inequalities of opportunity it had maintained.","Revolutionizing the housing industry, Levitt pioneered the affordable, planned suburban community, beginning his construction endeavors on the potato fields of Hempstead Plains on Long Island. With the mass production of homes, Levitt enabled past renters of urban-dwellings to become homeowners, an “embodiment of the American dream,” according to Kyle Sabo, a lifelong resident of the area. With this revolution of the housing industry, Levitt was praised by the media, with early articles and interviews speaking of the visionary vertical organization that Levitt employed in construction. Yet as the racist ploys throughout Levittown expanded, Levitt’s reputation shifted from a genius businessman to a prejudicial one, driven by his antagonistic views toward blacks and other minorities.","In the interview Thompson conducted with Levitt in 1954, the businessman denied any racist attitudes toward the black community. He defended his tactics as nothing more than techniques that were best for his business, stating, “as a company, [his] position was simple: [he] could solve a housing problem, or [he] could try to solve a racial problem. But [he] could not combine the two.”","Despite such claims however, the growing racist policies of Levitt’s suburbias could no longer escape public knowledge. Property owners, pressured into such contracts that prevented them from leasing or selling to blacks in the future had became common practice in Levittown. Residents were warned that violation of these conditions would not only result in penalty for themselves, but would cause an “invasion” of blacks into the town, bringing with it lower property values, crime, and danger to the very essence of suburbia. Even intermingling with blacks became dangerous, as Levitt evicted white families on the basis of welcoming black company in their suburban home.","With exposure of such practices, not surprisingly, came a growing opposition. In both Levitt’s Long Island community and his Bucks County community, resistance to segregation, as well as to blockbusting, grew. In Freeport, Long Island 240 white residents signed a petition, refusing to be solicited by local real estate agents. Black newspapers across the Bucks County area, notably the <em>Tribune, </em>issued articles filled with commentary of how Levitt’s towns were “breeding hate.” The Society of Friends became dedicated to circumventing the restrictive policies in place, successfully enabling the move-in of the first African American family to Levittown, PA in 1957. Such efforts alarmed whites opposed to integration, as uncovering of the problem increasingly incited reformist sentiment throughout such neighborhoods.","Despite the exposure, and accompanying intentions of challenging such policies, however, the suburban neighborhood of the 1950s served as the forerunner for what would become the trend across American suburbias for years to come. In the following decades, white communities throughout the country, aided by federal policy and the real estate agency, “protected” suburbia for themselves, fearful of the idea of an integrated community seeping into this type of residential setting. The effects have by no means disappeared in modern times, as the impact of such actions are still felt in Long Island’s Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as throughout Bucks county, which display significant racial disparities, regrettably referred to by residents as “a checkerboard of racially, ethnically, and economically segregated communities.”"," "],"locations":[{"id":28529,"lat":40.9562853666,"lng":-73.0371992045,"zoom":9,"place":"Suffolk, New York"},{"id":29305,"lat":40.6374264514,"lng":-73.5488485883,"zoom":10,"place":"Nassau, New York"},{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}]},{"id":5276,"title":"Cordless Tools spread in the Building Industry","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/80","end_date":"12/31/80","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1961, Black and Decker invented cordless power tools. Brian Hoy, who worked as a general contractor for over 30 years, found the convenience of these tools to be among the best technological changes in the industry especially for small jobs. He stated “cordless tools are one of the greatest tools to have come to the trade because of their eases of use.” One reason is because contractors do not have to waste time finding an outlet and make sure the cord is long enough to complete the job.  Cordless tools reduced the amount of time that contractor would have had to spend on a job because they can just grab to power tool and screw, drill, or cut within a few seconds. With the reduced about of time on jobs means that the builder can move onto the next job and might be able to do more work in a year than before.","As early as 1985 <em>Popular Science</em> talked about the changes that were made over the past twenty years. Over that span the volt size of the batteries, range of tools that are cordless, and weight. Popular Science also recognized how a contractor used cordless power tools to reduce time on jobs and increase the number of jobs per years. The size of the batteries that were used in the drills and the first ones were 4.8 volts in the 1960s, 9.6 volts in 1980s and 18 volts in 2000s. That is because of the different technologies has had advanced in the battery making and the ability to recharge the batteries in a shorter amount of time also. The article shows the different tools that were cordless in the 1980s and if you walked into any home improvement store that sold cordless tools in the early 2000s there would be more tools available for people to buy. Ed Doran discussed the different changes to the cordless tool industry with a new battery technology and how it will help take workers being more productive with less charging time. The weight of the cordless power tools have decline over the years because of technology in manufacturing and the materials used in the power tools.

Once the large companies started to make the nailers, and builders heard that the nailers saved time and money that the builders started to buy them.","In 1959, the air nailer was not seen as a device that people needed on the job. It was not until the late 1970s early 1980s that air nailers became widespread on the job site. This was because of the amount of time that was saved and the cost that were saved. From an article in <em>Popular Science</em>, the nailers were able to put 100 nails per minute, which is considerable higher than a human can nail in. With the air nailer it required less people to be on the jobsite than before because the nailers were quicker and only required one hand to use.
