{"id":118,"title":"Environmental History in Detroit","school_id":64,"school_name":"University of Michigan","term":"Winter 2014","abbr":"HIST 303","url":"","description":"Environmental history is the study of how people have both affected and been affected by their physical surroundings over time. In urban spaces, those physical surroundings take the form of both the built environment and the geological and biological aspects of the landscape. Urban environmental history, then, is the study not only of conservation and parks but also of how people use, access, and think about physical space; how food is cultivated or obtained; how different populations have reacted to industrial or urban development; the relationship between environmental conditions and demography; and how land use physically changes over time. In this course, we will learn to look at the world around us with a historical eye, thinking about how Detroit landscapes got the way they are today and how our perceptions of those landscapes have been shaped by cultural and social ideas about the urban environment. Readings, discussions, workshops, and mini-lectures will give you the broad tools and theories of environmental history, but it’s up to you to discover the details of Detroit’s past. The class is structured around an in-depth group research project, culminating in the creation of a multimedia website (using images, maps, text, video/audio, etc.) which will be made available to the Detroit community. Through this project you will come to understand how historical changes in the material world, and the ways people think about that world, have had concrete impacts on peoples’ lives. In addition, the websites you create will help local residents better understand the ways in which their city has changed over time and how their personal experiences are connected to larger stories about the relationships between people and their environment.","points":[[42.3649994065,-70.9800517697],[38.9151212228,-76.9435162098],[37.7029266937,-123.005394924],[42.107446354,-83.1351982696],[41.000231092,-78.474128629],[42.2533621325,-83.8384551752],[30.4938122303,-81.4274627631],[42.5970895978,-84.3735932032]],"bounds":[[42.5970895978,-70.9800517697],[30.4938122303,-123.005394924]],"episodes":[{"id":5826,"title":"Elixirs of Death: Human Health and the Dangers of Pesticides","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/45","end_date":"12/31/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The sixties marked a time of extraordinary social change and counter cultural struggle in America, and environmental issues surrounding dangerous chemicals had come to the forefront. In 1962, Rachel Carson, an award winning author, environmentalist, and scientist, published <em>Silent Spring</em>, a popular science book warning the public about the dangers of widespread use of pesticides. Its publication forged a link between urban and industrial issues with feas about degradation of the natural environment. In this small sampling of <em>Silent Spring</em>, Carson articulates her concern that pesticides may have harmful repercussions in humans, whether it be ingestion or accidental exposure to the chemicals. In addition, through the bio-accumulative process, the pesticides work their way into a larger ecological network and directly and indirectly affect the entire ecosystem. Traces of them are found in our soil, the fish we consume, the animals around us, and, most importantly, in our bodies. Due to their “biological potency”, Carson was concerned that pesticides poison our vital systems, destroy enzymes, block the oxidation process, or initiate a malignant change in the human cell.","While some scientists disagreed on the harmfulness of DDT in the human body, Dr. Wayland Hayes of the United States Public Health Service agreed that the presence of DDT in the body interrupts equilibrium in the body. One of the most alarming aspects of DDT was its transferability from one organism to another. Some early studies discovered that hay ingested by cows shows up in their milk. In similar situations, insecticidal chemicals have been found in human milk, which are then passed on to infants, resulting in weakened immune systems. Carson argues that even though immediate harm might not be detected due to exposure of pesticides, the prolong damages are severe.","In the post-war period the U.S. began an extensive utilization of industrial insecticides. The use of these chemicals grew substantially throughout this period up to the publication of <em>Silent Spring</em>, when Carson exposed to the public the gross uses of harmful chemicals by the government and major industries. <em>Silent Spring</em> initiated a moment in the American consciousness when people became aware of the dangers and began to challenge the government.  Carson expressed concern over the results of chemical buildups in humans and animals. The chemical and agricultural industries were strong players on the national stage, but Carson’s book raised a significant amount of awareness, and fear, about the widespread ramifications of pesticide application."],"locations":[{"id":25150,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":10,"place":"Suffolk, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":87,"tag":"Environment"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"},{"id":1882,"tag":"Pesticides"},{"id":1883,"tag":"Chemical contamination"}]},{"id":5829,"title":"<strong>Critiquing the Use of Tetraethyl Lead in Gasoline</strong>","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"12/31/25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","In Washington D.C. in 1925, the day of the official conference decision regarding the use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline, Alice Hamilton, a leader in the field of toxicology and occupational diseases, issued an article discussing her rejection of the previous 1924 Bureau of Mines Report. The 1924 Bureau of Mines Report stated that tetraethyl lead was safe for gasoline. Hamilton argued that the report, which tested tetraethyl gasoline on animals, was incorrectly analyzed and poorly conditioned to determine the correlating safety for humans. She further refuted the report by offering four unanswered questions regarding tetraethyl lead gasoline and its interactions with humans. She called into question the potential damage of manufacturing ethyl fluid to factory employees. Within the last seventeen months seventeen men had died and one became insane as a result of manufacturing this compound. Next, Hamilton addresses potential damage to gas station workers and service employees who combine the ethyl-fluid with the gasoline and pump it into automobiles. Lastly, she questions the danger regarding the emission of ethyl gasoline to the public airspace by way of car exhaust. While Hamilton acknowledged some previous scientific research into the matter, she still argued that the results were insufficient as they did not focus on the correct areas of research and the potentially for environmentally damaging side-effects to affect humans. Hamilton concluded her article by urging the conference to discontinue use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline until further research could determine the safety of its unknown effects.","During her medical studies at the University of Michigan, Hamilton utilized her academic discipline of medical science towards social reform by looking at environmentalism through a health perspective. After she was appointed to the Illinois Commission on Occupational Diseases, Hamilton began delving into investigations on lead industries. Since lead and the chemical compounds associated with it are extremely dangerous and in high demand during the rapidly expanding automobile industry of the early 1900’s, Hamilton’s work is invaluable to help to situate ourselves in understanding lead’s environmental impacts. Furthermore, Hamilton was a powerful environmental advocate in an era when the term “environmental” had yet to be established as an ideology. As a result of her influence, she must be seen as a core figure in the reconstruction of the urban and industrial roots of environmentalism."],"locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1457,"tag":"workplace safety"},{"id":87,"tag":"Environment"},{"id":908,"tag":"Pollution"}]},{"id":5827,"title":"<strong>Conservation Conversation</strong>","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/07","end_date":"12/31/13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1907, the city of San Francisco wanted to flood the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park by creating a dam to provide water to their city’s increasing population and support urban reform after the devastating 1906 earthquake. John Muir, a leader of environmental preservation activists, was enraged that they would taint this beautiful creation of God with 170 feet of water. He published his compelling article, “The Tuolomne Yosemite in Danger” on November 2, 1907, as an attempt to appeal to his followers and regular folks alike, with rich and poetic descriptions of the emotional and spiritual values of leaving nature alone.","One of the major opponents to Muir's ideas was Gifford Pinchot, who testified in front of the House Committee of Public Lands in support of the construction of the Hetch Hetchy Dam. He believed that human use of the land outweighed the pristine preservation of the land. Specifically, the water and electricity supply for San Francisco would utilize resources within the environment, all while conserving the beauty of the Hetch Hetchy Valley. Pinchot further stated there would be improvements in forest fire fighting, as well as more accessibility for increased tourism. Disagreeing with Muir, Pinchot believed the benefits outweighed the costs.","Regarding the different interests concerning public land use, this has been discussed as the first major and ongoing debate over preservation and conservation. Preservation, meaning leaving the land untouched, and conservation implying sustainable maintenance and usage. This debate represents a shift in how the environment should be utilized, questioning the availability of resources and aesthetics."],"locations":[{"id":52323,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":87,"tag":"Environment"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1884,"tag":"Hetch Hetchy"}]},{"id":5828,"title":"Cesar Chavez Testifies on the Health Effects of Pesticides Among Migrant Farm Workers","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/69","end_date":"8/1/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rashes, eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headaches, double vision, dizziness, skin irritation, loss of fingernails, nervousness, diarrhea, amongst a slue of other dangerous side effects are all results of chemical poisoning.

Several hundred Detroiters could brave the dip for only 15 minutes each, but swimming was not the only weekend activity available on the large, lush island of recreation for escapees of the industrial city. Visitors could enjoy a stroll through the vast and deep wooded areas of the island park and enjoy the beauty of the seasons in change; green leaves beginning to give way to russet and crimson on the tall trees. A matinee band played popular tunes to a sizable crowd while families, couples and friends relaxed around the bandstand on the benches or gazed out over the river at Canada or at the few, experienced boatmen navigating the water. Canoes were also navigating a waterway internal to the island: the canal system was at capacity as visitors tried their hand or paddle. The afternoon was made all the more pleasant for the crowds as the criminal element was apparently also on their rest day, with no pickpocketing, injuries, damage or theft of the many cars on the island.","This jovial newspaper account of the recreational uses of Detroit's Belle Isle park is an excellent representation of the many ways in which a city can shape the natural environment. Belle Isle is a particularly striking example, as it is literally an attempt to preserve an island of natural space within one of America's most industrialised cities. For the mainly hard working, blue collar, immigrant and African-American population the Isle was a space where they could escape their weekday toil and truly relax with their families. The many uses of Belle Isle reflect its role as a multi-faceted space used by all of the city's vast array of residents. As an almost purely recreational space (there was a small commercial fishery on the island) Belle Isle is expressive of the culture of Detroiters and how they had fun at the time, contrasted with the intense and dominating industrialisation of the city. Only a mile or so down stream the river was filled with ships and further on lined with polluting factories in which the men enjoying the island worked long and tough hours. The island was particularly popular for motoring enthusiasts and Sunday drivers, revealing the upper class who could afford auto-mobiles (which many of the other visitors may have helped built in the numerous car factories in Detroit) also had a use for the public park.","Many people describe cities metaphorically as organisms or natural systems, with individual but vitally connected parts. If the heart and hands of Detroit are in its factories, perhaps it's hind end is relaxing on Belle Isle."],"locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1903,"tag":"Park"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1902,"tag":"recreation"},{"id":1310,"tag":"urban history"}]},{"id":5830,"title":"U-Regulations approved for Protection of Wilderness Areas","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"9/19/39","end_date":"9/19/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Famous early environmentalist Robert Marshall, the head of recreation for the National Forest service and founder of the Wilderness Society, marched into congress to make sweeping reform.

These regulations were to preserve the natural environment under the protection of the Forest Service. Regulation U-1 became a protection for land 100k acres or more which banned commercial and limited recreational activity. Regulation U-2 revised old classifications of \"primitive areas\" to be renamed wilderness areas. Now the environment will become more inviting.

Johnson made the regulations permanent with the landmark 1964 Wilderness Act. Shifting authority to designate land or remove Wilderness status from the bureaucratic Forest Service to Congress, only legislators can now make changes to the U-Regulations, and the current Wilderness areas are now permanently preserved.

Although the synthetic rubber had not progressed as much in the laboratories, the plant-built “wool” had, appearing to be comparable with natural wool.  The material, intending to be used for upholstery fabrics, was allegedly the first to be produced from vegetable protein.  After years of research, the soy-based wool served many purposes, supplementing the country’s wool crop, and may have even met the war-time demand for the material.","Due to the Great Depression, most of Ford’s research took place during that time period. He soon came to believe that the practical use of soybeans would become influential in the role of lifting America out of the depression.

There is much talk about the school board budget and the spending on campaign literature but only one article asks the question: why is there no talk of the highly successful urban farming progam? Detroit's mayor, Hazen Pingree, had made a name for himself and his city by initating a vacant-lot gardening program following the economic depression of 1893 in which the city donated unused plots on the edge of development to poor, mostly immigrant laborers so that they could be employed in growing their own food. After only a few years the program was considered a resounding success, as the monetary value of the produce grown on these vacant-lot gardens far exceeded the money allotted to the program in the city budget. This success had inspired many other American cities such as New York and Chicago to start their own vacant-lot gardening programs so as to deal with urban poverty and unemployment, and was a huge poltiical win for Pingree.  However, as the economy started to improve and employment increased, interest in the program began to wane. This article from the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> calls upon the city and Pingree to continue to fund the program. It quotes Pingree talking about the positive publicity that the program had generated for Detroit, going so far as to claim that it was his city's primary claim to national fame. Despite this lofty praise from its founder, Detroit's vacant-lot gardening program would only last another year before being abandoned.","This article unknowingly traces the decline in interest in Detroit's vacant-lot gardening program, which, in the context of the history of urban agriculture in the United States, is not really a novel story. Urban farming in the United States has been linked to a cyclical pattern of urban land use that can be understood as reacting to periodic economic downturns or wartime efforts.  Historically, urban farming has been in vogue when the sociopolitical and economic climate was conducive to public investment in efforts to alleviate poverty that are seen as a temporary fix. Farming on donated and unused land allows the poor and unskilled to produce something with minimal capital investment and oversight, and appeals to sensibilities that stress a strong work ethic and a self-help stance on economic disadvantage. The most recent urban farming movement in Detroit is potentially of a different ilk as it is more a grassroots effort, as opposed to an official policy, but there are many similarities with past manifestations of this idea. Detroit is once more on the map, so to speak, because of its \"innovative\" urban farms which are seen as making use of unused land and as a positive, constructive response to urban poverty and scarcity. The future of the current urban farming movement in Detroit is anyone's guess as the local economy improves, but it is useful to understand that it is drawing on a tradition started with Pingree's potato patches, and potentially sharing some of the same soil."],"locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1905,"tag":"Urban Farm"},{"id":1904,"tag":"Pingree"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1908,"tag":"Garden"}]},{"id":5836,"title":"Whiskey Bottles Thrown in the River Rouge","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"5/1/09","end_date":"5/31/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When the sheriff told Frank Akey that the whiskey bottle he had confiscated the night before was now at the bottom of the River Rogue, Akey promptly ran into the town and let everyone know.

This now-public knowledge was met with unrest, and an apparent intention to fish out every last bottle from the river.","Since the story was published in the Sunday morning paper, and this news had only broken Saturday night, what became of this communal anxiety is unknown. What contributes most to this story is the author's speculation about the response. The author embraces the lamenting tone, cursing that the \"liquid joy\" was wasted at the bottom of a river with only the unappreciative fish, and that every fishing tackle must make an effort to do its duty and bring back Delray's \"beloved\" from the River Rouge. An important takeaway from the article is not only the strong devotion to their alcohol, squandered by the good sheriff, but the relationship between the river and the community. It is a waste receptacle, that at this point is at least presumed to contain some fish. This article is a first look at the relationship of a community to a river that 60 years later will catch on fire.","At the turn of the century, Delray was a rapidly growing community on the banks of the river in southwestern Detroit.

This played a key role in the “white flight” that occurred shortly afterwards, in which middle-class whites began moving out of the east side of Detroit, which was predominantly black as a result of discriminatory housing practices. Black Bottom, where the bulk of the violence took place, was one of the principle neighborhoods in which blacks could live and there was a high concentration of poverty in it.

The rapid expansion of urban populations led to concerns that the remaining farmers would not be able to grow enough to feed them all. Some urban intellectuals suggested that people should move “Back to the Farm” in order to ensure a sufficient food supply for the country.","In September of 1910, for example, an article in the Detroit Free Press used the upcoming census as a chance for people to react to both urban and rural growth. The author believed that after decades of urban growth, the country would finally outnumber the cities nationwide. The author attributes this shift to the disadvantages of country life compared to the urban advantages of technological advancements such as the trolley, the telephone and mail. He also suggests that farmers should make a lot of money because they have to feed all the people in the cities.","Almost exactly one year later, another editorial with similar themes was published about the \"Back to the Farm\" movement.

He calls for a \"co-ordinate relationships between city and surrounding rural areas\" where both city and farm living is healthy for the well-being of the human population as a whole.  The author in the Detroit Free Press editorial is enraged at this doctor and angrily questions the existence of sociology and the doctor grouping society as a whole instead of leaving it up to the free will of individuals to make choices.","A few days later, a third article stated that Thomas Edison visited Austria and declared that everyone should have a small plot of land to grow food for themselves and their families. He says that “rural life is the basis for human happiness,” and calls urban settings “artificial.”","The arguments in this series of editorials sets up the city and countryside as polar opposites, when they are actually inherently related. We see the relationship between the cities and the countryside in the first two editorials, where the city-dwellers depend on the produce from the countryside to feed themselves and their families.

Disruptions continued into the next day, including the closures of many schools and local businesses.","The report of the attack on the woman and her child may have been the spark that ignited the riots, but there already existed a very racialized climate in the city of Detroit during World War II. Many factors contributed to this. With Detroit's factories increasing their production on account of the war effort, the population of the city increased rapidly with people looking to secure jobs. This led to blacks and whites competing for the same positions, with additional issues arising when a black man rose higher in the company than his white colleagues. Many suggest that an incident regarding housing had a direct impact on the riots. Since much of the housing for African Americans was overcrowded and in deplorable conditions, the government built a new housing project for some African American workers. Some white citizens believed that they should live there instead so the government handed it over to them. After much objection, the government once again returned it the African Americans. The whites protested on move-in day and had to be forcibly removed. Therefore, it was not one event that caused the fighting to break out. There were many racist practices, policies, and mindsets that culminated in the Race Riot of 1943."],"locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":1921,"tag":"Housing discrimination"}]},{"id":5844,"title":"An Oral History of Detroit's 1967 Race Riots","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"7/23/67","end_date":"7/27/67","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Detroit resident James E. Cummings remembers the Detroit race riots that started on the morning of July 23, 1967. The race riots were provoked by a raid of an after-hours bar, known as a \"blind pig,\" on the corner of 12th and Clairmount streets. Cummings recollects not only the violence of the days that followed, in which arson and looting were commonplace and 2,000 buildings were destroyed, but also how the riots impacted his ability to buy property. Business owners were eager to sell their businesses “almost on your terms” out of fear that another riot would occur to further lower property values. The 1967 riots only ended after five days as a result of troops from the Army, sent in by then President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the Michigan National Guard, sent in by then Governor George W. Romney. The riots led to 43 deaths, 1,189 injures, and over 7,000 arrests.","The riots were preceded by racial segregation, such as that exhibited by Black Bottom, a neighborhood primarily composed of Blacks that once existed (but was destroyed by urban renewal projects in the 1960s). Black Bottom is an example of how whites attempted to contain blacks in certain parts of the City of Detroit, out of fear that blacks would negatively affect the entire city if given the opportunity to live anywhere they chose. Thus, many homes built before the 1967 riots were built with a restrictive covenant that prohibited the selling of the home to blacks. The riots of 1967 foreshadowed continued racial tension between whites and blacks, and led whites to fear that another revolt by blacks would ensue. In the aftermath of the race riots, many whites decided to move outside of the City of Detroit to its suburbs for the safety of their families and to ensure that they could continue their business elsewhere without fear of another civil unrest. The spread of whites to suburbs during this time continued for several decades thereafter and left a significant mark on the City of Detroit and its perception to non-Detroiters in America."],"locations":[{"id":33546,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2021,"tag":"African American history"},{"id":1914,"tag":"Black Bottom"},{"id":1922,"tag":"Detroit race riots"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"}]},{"id":5845,"title":"Frederick Law Olmsted:The OG of Belle Isle","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-11-01","end_date":"1882-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Surrounded by the rushing waters of the Detroit River, Belle Isle is no stranger to the enjoyment people can find from water recreation. The original development of Belle Isle Park's rivers and boating areas is discussed in a report by Frederick Law Olmsted, then America's premiere landscape architect, in his proposal for Detroit in November of 1882. In his original plan for Belle Isle, Olmsted discusses the need for boating recreation in the park, and suggests that it would be a fairly easy process to implement artificial waterways running through the park. He argues that the current water drainage channels, which were built to drain the marshy ground in 1882, were unsuitable for anything productive, as they were too low for drainage and created dangerous health conditions.","Concerning Belle Isle's waterways and recreation, Olmsted saw much potential in the design of streams through the island while still maintaining a natural appearance.

He saw the many unused, vacant, and abandoned lots in his city as an opportunity for the poor to cultivate crops to feed their families and ride out the hard economic times the nation was experiencing.

The city administration would often boast that \"Detroit has a lot of things going for itself,\" which was probably true relative to other major cities in the North. African American people lived in some of the finer areas of the city and did not have to deal with a lot of the poor housing like places in New York. There was also strong employment for African Americans, specifically in the auto plants. Furthermore, the leaders of the city -- both white and black -- remembered the violent riots of 1943 and wanted to avoid repetion. However, in 1967 tensions boiled over, and most of Detrot's African American population rebelled against the city's social structure. Many looted stores and vandalized buildings. Many of the Black leaders tried to encourage the angry masses to cool down, but their efforts went nowhere.","The Detroit Rebellion of 1967 can be attributed to multiple social injustices against Blacks. It is ultimately believed that people grew tired of unfair practices and rose up to force change. The Black population had grown tired of unfair housing policies such as \"Urban Renewal\" which displaced countless low income African American families in the 1950s so that highways for example could be built. The African American residents were also tired of being harrased by policemen who were predominately White. Although some of the actions taken by many in the Black community can be called into question (i.e. looting and general vandalism) it is believed that the people felt so oppressed by the social systems of the time that they had no other choice. Therefore their actions are viewed by many as a act of rebellion against an oppressive system and not a riot which connotes lawless behavior and is without meaningful purpose.","Despite the lives that were lost and all the property damage that resulted from the 1967 rebellion, twenty years later some things still seemed unchanged or in some instances appeared to be worse.  Blacks in Detroit still faced staggering unemployment numbers and often times nicer housing was not accessible for all Blacks. However, in the aftermath of the rebellion, the city did seem to be more responsive to Blacks in some ways: in the 1970s Detroit had a black mayor (Coleman Young), a black police chief, a black school superintendent, a black majority city council, and a police department that did not seem at war with the city's blacks.

As the designer of the first municipal park in America, he is considered the father of landscape architecture. With his pioneering expertise cultivated through years of follow-up work, Olmstead wrote an explanation for future planning of Belle Isle Park, a “gem” in the midst of the Detroit river, which runs between the United States and Canada. In it, Olmstead claimed that the possibilities for Belle Isle were as great as in his other works, such as Central Park in New York City, Mount Royal Park in Quebec, and the Emerald Necklace in Boston, Massachusetts. His plan for Belle Isle envisioned capitalizing on the island's existing wooded areas as the park's central attraction, and nurturing the trees into a majestic forest. He also saw the island's fields as possibly the best area for a marching band in all the Parks of the United States, and the rivers that ran through the island an attraction for boaters and fishermen. Olmstead also warned that fluctuations in economy would harm a city owned park if not properly addressed from the beginning. He advised that what the city may consider financially rewarding in the short term, such as a new recreation building, lessens the value in the park if not properly funded and maintained. These words would seem prophetic in the early twenty-first century, when city managers are struggling with strategies for maintaining the municipal use of Belle Isle.","Olmstead's plan was an early visualization of how parks and nature are not separate, but can exist symbiotically. The idea of a wilderness is a constructed ideology. A park which includes shelters and buildings for relaxing would not be shattering a pristine wilderness, but instead make the area more attractive for visitors. His vision of the park is also one that looks holistically at Belle Isle, as the park becomes a maintained organism. His vision to utilize the natural rivers as an attraction for boaters, and the trees as an inspiration for the architecture for future buildings, show how human interaction with Belle Isle was shaped by the island's natural resources. His warning of the possible problems with financing shows the tension between park maintenance and park financing has been around from the conception of the island."],"locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1944,"tag":"Frederick Olmstead"},{"id":1902,"tag":"recreation"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"},{"id":1947,"tag":"City parks"}]},{"id":5858,"title":"Diverse Industries in Pre-Automobile Delray","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"5/26/01","end_date":"5/26/01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Delray’s appealing waterfront location in southwest Detroit attracted a diverse group of industries to the area. Businesses were attracted to the accessibility of transport, both riverfront and railway lines, and abundance of human capital. In May of 1901, M. J. Murphy, owner of Murphy Chair Company, purchased 50 acres of land in Delray, stretching from River Street to the channel bank of the Detroit River. Murphy would pay a yearly rent of $3000, which is equivalent to roughly $85,000 in 2012 values, and had the option to buy the property for $75,000 (about $2.2 million in 2012). While the public was not yet sure about the exact use he would make of the property, Murphy was likely to opt for a manufacturing plant, where he would join various other industries in the area. One of his neighbors, F. E. Driggs, a partner in the prominent law firm Driggs & Meddaugh, leased 30 acres of land along the river bank, and planned to use the site for larger manufacturing plants to take advantage of the nearby shipping facilities. The 20 acres of land west of Mr. Drigg’s property was sold to Swift & Co., a meatpacking company.","Murphy, Driggs, and Swift and Co. were just three of many who invested in Delray. Pre-auto industries in the area included pharmaceutical, shipbuilding, stoves, steam radiators and boilers, brass goods, chemicals, tobacco products, and garment. Delray’s industrial history dates back to the early 1830s, and the large influx of eastern and southern Europeans over the course of the nineteenth century provided the manpower for the thriving industries. Detroit’s labor force is intimately connected with the factories, and Delray was at the hub of the city’s industrial movement. Detroit’s present and future prosperity is closely associated with success in the manufacturing industries."," "],"locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"}]},{"id":5859,"title":"All Quiet in Delray?

Consider Delray. Delray, a neighborhood approximately two miles south of the city center has long been a major industrial center for the city. Home to salt mines, steel plants, and later a massive waste water treatment facility, Delray has borne the brunt of heavy industry for Detroit, often at major environmental consequences to its citizens and laborers. Additionally, the majority of the citizens who lived and worked in Delray were working-class immigrants, first from Eastern Europe and later from the American South.","The process of Delray's annexation by the City of Detroit in 1905 demonstrates the tenuous relationship between the two entities. Both groups needed each other, but did not seem to want each other. This is evidenced by both Detroit’s lack of desire to provide basic services such as lighting to the area, as well as Delray commissioners' plan to fight annexation in general. Detroit, being the more powerful entity in the relationship, did end up annexing Delray, and quieting the voices of opposition that resided there. This semi-hostile takeover is an important consideration in the context of urban metabolism, and the important transition from city to metro. Even today, Delray still internalizes the environmental degradation that provides industrial outputs to Detroit.

The Detroit of the mid-18th century would have looked very different from the sprawling metropolis of today. Where the imposing skyscrapers of Detroit's downtown now dominate the riverfront, there would have been a sparsely populated settlement consisting of humble farms built along the river and extending a few miles inland. These narrow, elongated, side-by-side farm plots with riverfront access known as \"ribbon farms\" may seem to be relegated to the historical imaginary as the complexity and denisty of land use in modern Detroit does not seem to betray any remnant of this pastoral history. However, the ordering logic of the ribbon farms can be seen through the modern infrastructure and development that has buried it. Like a palimpsest, the farms of the French settlers can be traced out beneath the streets of the city.","In a 1915 real estate atlas of Detroit, long after the ribbon farms had disappeared beneath an urban, industrialized landscape, the original boundaries of the plots are still marked on the margins of the map.  While this may at first seem counterintuitive given that these plots do not correspond with the land use of 1915 Detroit, a closer look reveals that many of Detroit's streets roughly traced the boundary lines of the French ribbon farms. For instance, Dequindre Street extended from the river in a line that almost perfectly traced the eastern edge of the former Dequindre farm plot. Detroit grew up piecemeal from the ribbon farm plots as they were sold off through the 18th and early 19th centuries and thus, even after Detroit had long forgotten its agricultural beginnings, one could and still can trace the ribbon farms in the design of the urban fabric.","This story of the layering of human land use makes an important point about the study of history, especially in an urban area in which the intense pressure for development leads to a high turnover in land use. Human history, in the absence of iconic landmarks such as pyramids or the like, is often discussed in abstract terms that, while certainly a proper workout for one's imaginative capabilities, do not always resonate with an understanding of ecological or geological history which attest to an immense, temporal depth to natural and man-made events. This abstraction of historical reality becomes especially problematic when it does not take the trained eye of an archaeologist to trace out the patterns of former events and practices, such as in the streets of Detroit. By recognizing how historical land use can still order our present reality we can likewise gain a better perspective on how human interactions with an environment have a profound and lasting impact on said environment."],"locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1948,"tag":"Ribbon Farm"},{"id":769,"tag":"Map"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1965,"tag":"New France"}]},{"id":5867,"title":"Construction of the Ambassador Bridge","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/27","end_date":"12/31/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When construction of the Ambassador Bridge began in 1927, railroads that met ferries connected Windsor, on the Canadian side of the Detroit River, with the city of Detroit. The bridge to Canada created an artery of commerce, and would maintain a position of great importance in trade between the two cities for decades to come. The bridge would go on to connect I-75, I-96, and Hwy 3. Creating this fluid transportation of goods through the city contributed to the need for a freeway system connecting to the bridge. As the suburbs began to grow, expressways into and through the city doubled as trade corridors, at the cost of subdividing and transforming the city below them.","When the company owning the bridge went public in 1979, Detroit native Manuel Moroun, the largest private landowner in the state, acquired the bridge through a large-scale stock buy.

Sinclair was involved in many important Detroit organisations such as the Detroit Artists Workshop Press, which became famous 'hippy' collective Trans Love Energies. The location of the event as a political space is particularly appropriate as the origin of the 1943 race riot, for Sinclair participated in the 1967 riots and was jailed, arguably politically, for 2 years following this.

However, the narrative of economic progress for blacks is not the most important component of this street’s rich history.

Behind them is a heavily wooded shoreline, and what seems to be a bridge.  The photo is taken after Frederick Law Olmsted, then America's premiere landscape architect, had proposed his plan for Belle Isle’s design. He had anticipated that artificial waterways be implemented on the island for water recreation such as boating, but said nothing of fisheries or using the water for industry.","Perhaps Olmsted did not envision fisheries in his initial plan because he did not agree with using natural parks in this way.  He represented a the middle ground between John Muir's preservationist movement and Gifford Pinchot's utilitarian vision of nature.  Utilizing Belle Isle Park’s waterways for fishing is something Pinchot would agree with, as long as it was done conservatively, in a way that would preserve the fish stocks for the future. Olmsted probably envisioned waterways in the park for boating and recreation (and not fishing) because he saw nature as a place for reverence and use.  The artificial waterways he planned are inherently for “use” as the original land would be altered, but the boat users would still be able to enjoy their natural surroundings. Olmsted's vision was also one that matched that of the upper class, who had the time and money to boat and use the water for leisure.  Working class families did not have this luxury; perhaps the men in the photo are fishing to feed their families. The varying plans for use of Belle Isle's waterways can therefore represent a larger struggle of socioeconomic class in how to utilize this shared space."],"locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1958,"tag":"Waterways"},{"id":1957,"tag":"Fisheries"},{"id":1926,"tag":"Frederick Law Olmsted"},{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"}]},{"id":5866,"title":"Rise and Fall of Paradise Valley","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/43","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the late 1930’s and early 1940s, Paradise Valley was one of the few Detroit neighborhoods in which black people were allowed to reside.

The project held two different residental areas: Parkside Homes for white people, and Brewster Homes for black people. Eugene P. Opperman was named Resident Manager of Parkside and George A. Isabell was named Resident Manager of Brewster. Their first duties included overseeineg the applicant process for potential tenants, which was very strict. Caution was taken to ensure that \"the spirit and intent of these low-rent projects\" was upheld. Eligibility requirements included such things as inspection of the potential tenants' current living conditions, their fitness, their moral credit, and their income, as that one member of each family in the projects was required to have a full-time job. Many families who moved into the projects came from \"miserable, damp, unhealthful quarters\" where overcrowding was common and alleyways were considered backyards. To aid in giving these low-income renters a better place to live, the Brewster projects were built near the factory in which many tenants worked, so that they could walk to work and easily get back home. By the end of December of the first year, 539 tenants had moved into the available 775 units of Parkside and 551 tenants had moved into the available 701 units of Brewster. Applications for Parkside currently totaled 5,951 and 6,059 for Brewster respectively. The projects were praised as a way to provide decent, healthy, and safe living conditions in new beautiful neighborhoods that would offer Detroit's poor \"a new lease on life\".","This government-documented account of the initial ideas and creation behind Detroit's low-income public housing projects provide an excellent representation of historical environmental racism in three significant ways. First, this account from the Michigan Housing Commission shows that historically, \"the spatiality of racism is not understood, particularly the relationship between places\" (Pulido). Even accounting for the acceptance of racism at the time (such as segregated housing and creating more units for Whites, despite a higher demand from Blacks) this document still holds underlying environmentally racist issues, with the most prominent being that the housing units for Blacks were located closest to the factories, where air pollution was surely present. These neighborhoods might not have been any safer than the old ones, especially considering the amount of polluted emissions allowed in the 1940's, despite being praised on a national scale as a great step towards a safe and happy city. The placement in Detroit in which these houses were designated was not environmentally equal to those given to Whites, yet allowed to occur on the claim of mass transportation ease. Second, this document illustrates how heavily the government was involved in assessing the morality of tenants moving into the projects by determining their current living conditions as a way to assess their moral character. This coincides with ideas of the time that those who lived in poor and dirty areas were bad people, instead of realizing the political system that may have put them in such conditions. Finally, this document provides rationale behind the first step to Detroit's larger \"slum clearance\" plans to come later in the '60's. The African-Americans who were moved into the projects had been forced to leave the area they already lived in (Blackbottom) to make way for a highway. By marketing the projects as a beautiful new place to live, the government justitied their plans as best for the city and its people. However, we know today that there are many historical accounts of the injustice behind this plan, since Blackbottom was alternatively considered by its community as a vibrant neighborhood with alleyways - that the government called dirty and unsafe - serving as largely communal family spaces for gathering and growing urban gardens. Overall, this document shows that the environmental relationship and Detroit's city planner's allocation of home and neighborhood played a big part of the injust racism in Detroit's old African-American neighborhood of Blackbottom, despite being perceived quite differently at the time."],"locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1993,"tag":"Parkside Homes"},{"id":1992,"tag":"Brewster Homes"},{"id":1969,"tag":"Public housing"},{"id":1968,"tag":"Blackbottom, Detroit"},{"id":1921,"tag":"Housing discrimination"}]},{"id":5871,"title":"Home is a relative term","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"12/31/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Between 1920 and 1970, millions of Blacks migrated from the South in pursuit of job opportunities in the manufacturing industry of the Midwest and Northeast.

The majority were constrained by discriminatory housing policies to only certain neighborhoods, one of which was Black Bottom, located on the southeast side of Detroit.

The Detroit River, the natural barrier between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan, would often freeze up and interrupt shipments between the trading partners. Shipping vessels could only be hopeful for an “open” winter. Even then, ships could take upwards of two hours to cross the river, leaving thousands of cars stuck on both sides with no way to proceed. With 389,239 railroad cars ferried across the Detroit River in 1887, the railroad industry had special interests in a railroad bridge to reduce its dependency on ferries. As bridges and tunnels began to spring up (and down) in other parts of the world in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, such as the Mersey Tunnel in England or the cantilever on the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie, the McMillian Bill outlined plans for an international bridge between Windsor and Detroit.","Along with the idea of the bridge came multiple voices with suggestions on how to satisfy the immediate necessity for more rapid transfer of cars. The options were either a low bridge, high bridge, or tunnel. The option of a low bridge was eliminated as it would obstruct vessel movements along the water. The option of a tunnel depended on the feasibility and cost of such an engineering feat. While the Michigan Central Railway Station supported the construction of a bridge over a tunnel, the company was not in favor of the private company, Lindenthal Co., given the rights to build the bridge. Henry Russell, the attorney for the Central, claimed Lindenthal was an irresponsible company that only wanted to build a monumental, multimillion dollar infrastructure to honor itself. Detroit merchants critized the planned location of the railroad terminal for being too far from the downtown business district and other existing railroad terminals. Vessel companies shared a different angle of opposition, stating that the bridge enhanced railroad interests and impeded those of lake carriers. Vessel owners claimed that the bridge's piers would obstruct navigation and the bridge's height would prevent large vessels from passing through. While the different industries were motivated by separate incentives, Michigan Central and vessel companies rallied together as allies and served as formidable opposition against Senator McMillian’s proposed bridge plan."],"locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1973,"tag":"Detroit Windsor Bridge"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"}]},{"id":5873,"title":"Changing Landscapes in Northeast Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/27","end_date":"12/31/47","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Steve Spilos' neighborhood on the outskirts of Detroit changed drastically over the course of his life.

In 1927, just before the City Airport was constructed, the tank was a well-known landmark by pilots and passengers from all over the country. Spilos left the city for a while and upon his return in 1947 everything was changed. A place that once had a running creek, farm, and woods was now turning into the standard industrial city. With factories like Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, and Briggs moving into the city alongside the huge gas holder, Spilos couldn’t help but notice and document the radical changes he experienced in such a short period of time to a city he once knew so well.  He said, “The first thing one notices is the odor and the sound of dripping splashing tar… At times the tar leaks through and slides down the walls into the reservoir at the base of the tank.”","Changing landscapes can help or hurt a city, and for the Connor Creek neighborhood in Detroit, the latter is more applicable unfortunately.

Beginning work in the coal mines in DuBois, PA, John faced dire circumstances both down in the mines and above ground: whatever wages he earned were owed to the company store for sustenance before he even resurfaced with his pay. Given an opportunity to escape the mines, John moved to Detroit as an auto factory worker, promised a \"magnificent sum of $5 a day.\" Leading up to the Depression, as auto company layoffs and changeovers began, John harbored dreams of staring a grocery store, a dream to which he came one step closer when he began renting a candy shop on Hanson and Cicotte. Shortly after, John was finally able to take up renting a \"grocery-butcher shop with living quarters,\" fulfilling his dream. Working from 6:45 AM to 9:45 PM, John loved every moment and created a \"village meeting place\" equipped with the only telephone in the area. John even began extending credit to local patrons and ended every transaction with \"a little schnapps\" and a candy bar for each of the men's children. John was happy, and \"everyone was happy,\" until rationing and shortages brought on by the Second World War forced him to close the store and return to factory work. Though John never fully regained the losses from the outstanding credit, John remained \"happy and optimistic\" since he had \"achieved his dream, lived a good life, and loved his country with a passion.\"","John's fierce optimism and devotion to his community was characteristic of the time period as Sidney Fine writes in his biography of Frank Murphy. He describes the \"widespread belief in the United States before 1929 that a person who wished to work could find employment,\" a sentiment that is exhibited by John's dreams to leave a steady position and risk opening his own store. Frank Murphy, the mayor of Detroit leading up to and during the Great Depression, believed that citizens of Detroit should expect that their government should aid those in distress due to unemployment, stating that \"no one in this great city of plenty...must be allowed to go hungry, or cold, or unhoused, or unclothed.\" This belief led Murphy to start the Mayor's Unemployment Committee (MUC) to help to address issues of unemployement by sharing the importance of the issue with the whole community and framing the issue in a new light. MUC went on to establish several new programs, once of which was the Detroit thrift-gardens, a program that echoed the work of Hazen Pingree and his \"potato patches.\" In addition to providing much-needed food to the unemployed, Murphy believed that \"the psychological effect of idleness of large groups of our people...[is] dangerous to the safety and morale of the country\" and that the projects could help to cultivate work ethic for the unemployed. Though originally unsuccessful, the project eventually proved to provide work for the unemployed and allowed them to stay mentally and physically fit until they found another job while contributing to the greater community."],"locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"},{"id":21832,"lat":41.000231092,"lng":-78.474128629,"zoom":9,"place":"Clearfield, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1978,"tag":"Unemployment"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"},{"id":1908,"tag":"Garden"}]},{"id":5875,"title":"The Wealth of Michigan Lies in the Soil","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-23","end_date":"1842-02-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1842, <em>The Signal of Liberty</em>, a small newspaper associated with the Liberty Party of Michigan, published an article detailing the current state of agriculture in Michigan and the uncertainty surrounding its future.

Josiah Snow, a prominent Detroit resident, urged every town in Michigan to send petitions to Congress to demonstrate the state's unity on the issues facing what he described as their most important industry. Michigan's grain production exceeded New England's, New York's, and Ohio's making its economy especially vulnerable to restrictive policies.

Competition and high tariffs in eastern states, as well as Michigan's relatively cheap land, drove many small farmers from the east coast to migrate to Detroit and the surrounding areas. Between 1830 and 1840, the population of Detroit increased 309 percent due largely to the agricultural draw.

Pingree wrote an autobiography entitled <em>Facts and Opinions: Or, Dangers That Beset Us.</em> Far from laying out some nostalgic, narrative arc from his boyhood in rural Maine to his career as the populist mayor of a burgeoning industrial city, Pingree writes almost exclusively of his time as a mayor and conveys the gravitas with which he wielded his mayoral power to curtail the increasingly monopolistic influence of corporations.  One chapter, near the end of the book and after an exhaustive description of his struggles with greedy capitalists, highlights the potato patch scheme that gained Pingree significant national acclaim: a vacant-lot gardening program that successfully employed the unemployed in subsistence food production during the economic downturn of 1893.","Rather than relating this story personally, however, Pingree opts to preprint a public address by the aptly named Captain Cornelius Gardener who officially ran the program for its duration .Gardener, being a practical-minded man, does not embellish much in his post-operational breakdown of the successful program as he focuses on economics and logistics and positive press.  He does, however betray some overtly paternalistic and problematic conceptions of those who participated in the program, emphasizing their simplicity and that “they can be managed as easily as children.” This type of demeaning language, coupled with a photo in the chapter that depicts a family of farmers arranged in a stilted manner behind a handwritten sign in their garden that states “The name of the man who originated this system will be handed down to posterity” and a caption that explicitly labels them as Polish immigrants expose a darker side to the much lauded potato patch scheme.  Not only are immigrant communities and the poor being portrayed as simple and ignorant but they are also being used, objectified, as props in a propagandistic manner serving a political end wholly detached from their labor in the soil.","Here we see displayed something that potentially undermines the legacy of Pingree’s potato patch scheme or at least demands our critical examination.  To be honest though, it should come as no surprise that a philanthropic scheme in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century would have to play into prevailing notions of how to conceive of and treat the poor and immigrant populations.  Despite Pingree’s populist stance and posturing as a man of the people we should not fool ourselves into thinking that “people” meant quite the same thing then that it does to us now, and even today many programs developed to combat poverty and benefit immigrant communities come under intense criticism from those who still maintain that these populations must be made to be industrious and useful due to ingrained idleness or ignorance.  This is where urban farming as a means of social welfare must be incredibly careful to empower individuals without being paternalistic and demeaning or using that empowerment as a ploy for good press."],"locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1904,"tag":"Pingree"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"}]},{"id":5879,"title":"The Transformation of Conner Creek","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-01-01","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Conner Creek was a creek that used to run from what is now the City of Warren in Detroit to the Detroit River.  Before the turn of the 20th century, great fires would sometimes rage through the garbage-filled ditches in the area, as a result, property values dropped after each fire and small homes popped up all over; the following spring each year, however, the creek would overflow its 30-foot banks and flood the homes.  This cycle continued until adequate sewers were put in place.  At this point, Conner Creek was beautifully landscaped, flowing through ravines and valleys as it wound its way through Detroit.  However, because of the floods, the land’s only value was in its suitability for crops and the river’s usefulness in powering mills, as opposed to speculation, and the forests lining the river were cut down and replaced by ribbon farms and mills, planted by young men who were willing to work the land for a modest living.","As Detroit’s Indian trails and plank roads were replaced by railroads and paved roads and industry developed in Detroit, the farms and mills gradually turned into factories and plants, which were built over the creek.  Because of these changes, the creek now flows underground to the Jefferson Avenue Conner Creek Pumping Station of the Detroit Water and Sewage Department.  Many of the streets in the area are a testament to the river’s presence and importance to the Eastside, still following the plan established by the ribbon farms that lined Conner Creek.  The Detroit Eastside Community Collaborative is currently planning and constructing a greenway— a network of trails for walking, biking, and running— to commemorate this history and give Detroiters access to trails and other greenways.  The greenway follows the creek’s original path and, when finished, will connect Northeast Detroit’s neighborhoods and residents (only this time by a landscaped path rather than water).  The greenway will serve as the only evidence that a creek once flowed through the area, with bicycle tours and signs marking historical sites, reminding and teaching people of their neighborhood’s history."],"locations":[{"id":6597,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2003,"tag":"Nortown"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1984,"tag":"Conner Creek"},{"id":1988,"tag":"Infrastructure"}]},{"id":5880,"title":"A Nostalgic Account of Detroit at the Turn of the Century","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The lifestyles of Detroit citizens at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, particularly the activities and pastimes of the youth, are illuminated by George W.

Elliot Ave, which was then the city’s easterly boundary.  While the account given is a jubilant recollection of his youth, it also reveals much about the city's history of transportation and infrastructural development.","Among other things, Stark exuberantly recounts the excitement of watching a horse walk on a treadmill in order to power a saw which cut logs into plates that would be used to create roads.  He further describes the joyous times had by children playing with the stacks of these plates left by the sides of roads.  Stark posits that the children saw the logs as their own play things and built “houses, sheds, and most often, castles in the air.”  Interestingly, the phrase <em>castles in the air</em> was coined by transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau in his magnum opus, <em>Walden</em>, to describe an aspiration, desire, or fantasy.  With Stark’s application of the phrase in his revealing account of childhood in an earlier era of Detroit, Stark seems to say that childhood dreams were created in the process of playing with materials that would later form Detroit’s roads.","In a broader sense, the roads—and the auto industry they were created to help actualize—were once Detroit’s own castle in the air.  They encompassed a belief in the power of industrialization to facilitate the city’s progress.  More recently however, some people, such as Rebecca Solnit, have come to see the growth of auto industry and the division of Detroit by highways as a paradoxical problem for the city.  It is important to note that at the turn of the century roads were not being built with a monomaniacal automotive fixation; George Starks describes that, “In the late 1890’s, the bicycle craze was at its peak” (Stark 16).  Perhaps a return to non-motorized transportation, such as the current Connor Creek Greenway Project, will be beneficial to Detroit.  Presently it remains somewhat of a castle in the air, but now we need only to build a greater foundation under it."],"locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1986,"tag":"Mt.

Removing the freeway would be a step towards rebuilding community for the city, as the freeway's construction fifty years earlier destroyed the African-American neighborhood known as Blackbottom.

The 1993 event was a great success and showed a promising future for professional motor racing in the city with the richest auto history in the world. <br />Coming from the recent disappointment of the world renowned Formula 1 race series leaving the city in 1989, as no agreement with the already declining city could be agreed upon to move from the outdated Renaissance Center inner city track to the fresh Belle Isle, the 1992 move breathed a new lease on life into the city's racing industry. While the CART race brought crowds, adrenaline and excitement to Belle Isle each summer it was also abandoned in 2001 as it was deemed insufficient to the races needs. As the city further declined Belle Isle remained a city park with many other recreational uses for the people of Detroit, but was beginning to fall into disrepair. The raceway was again revived in 2007 as part of the Indy circuit, only to be cancelled by 2009 due to the particularly heavy impact of economic crisis on Detroit's auto industry.","Perhaps the island would have remained better off without the extensive changes made to its roads and landscape by accommodating these large auto races and the corporate promotion that accompanies them. Mayor Oscar Marx had firmly rejected the prospect of holding the 1913 Vanderbilt races upon the Isle as he was unwilling to “turn Belle Isle over to promoters who are seeking to make money” purely because it “belongs to the people” and should not be profited from. Marx's assertion that the park and island is property of all of the people of Detroit reflects the divisive, longstanding dominant narrative of ownership of Belle Isle. As the park's administration grappled with acceptable uses of the park and the representation of privately owned property and spaces, the funding for the park has experienced periods of plenty and poverty, culminating in the late 2013 decision by the struggling city of Detroit to lease the island to the State of Michigan to ensure its upkeep and longevity."],"locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1997,"tag":"racing"},{"id":1996,"tag":"Grand Prix"},{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"}]},{"id":5886,"title":"Market Mingling","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"9/10/32","end_date":"9/10/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the 1930s, Detroit’s Western Market was bustling with hundreds of farmers, buyers, and city dwellers.  Trucks were arranged as close as possible and numbers of large baskets containing fresh produce lined the surrounding area.

The placement of the Interstate cut off Fort Streets' local businesses' customer base, leaving the local businesses with little choice but to shut their doors.

While still in the planning stages, there was much debate over who should build, and then subsequently own, the bridge. Popular opinion was, by and large, in favor of the city of Detroit supplying the workers to build the bridge. Additionally, they felt that the city should also own and run the bridge. This would mean providing free access to the island. If a private corporation took over the bridge, they would be doing so for profit and would, therefore, require a fee to enter the island.","The city eventually did take ownership of the bridge which led to greater access for the residents of the Detroit.

The very bridge structure acted as an equalizer among the classes. This is additionally why the state takeover of the park is such a contentious issue among the citizens of Detroit. You have to buy a state park pass in order to cross over the bridge into Belle Isle. While it is a nominal amount, many families do not have any disposable income that can go towards that.

The pamphlet extolled the consolidation itself, the reorganization and expansion projects since then, and described the future Department's future plans. Despite the wartime restrictions and the depression, the Department's first six years introduced a number of significant new programs in Detroit, including city-owned horseback riding, canoe rentals through Belle Isle Park, expansion plans for picnics and playgrounds, the increased productivity of the Belle Isle Greenhouse run by the Horticulture Association, and the consolidated management of six swimming pools throughout the city.","After President Franklin D.

This increase strained the recreational facilities for those who wanted to escape their job in the industrial sector.

Crime was at an all time high, the economy was in decline, and race relations of the city were in shambles. These issues were directly related to the changing demographics of the city. According to a map produced as part of a teacher training project for Detroit public schools, much of the city was geographically divided into distinct ethnic communities. The map shows designated ethnic groups throughout Detroit that compromise 50% or more of the areas' population. Identified ethnic groups included Blacks, Whites, Germans, Polish, Italians, Jewish, Mexicans, Greek, and Middle Eastern, among others. There was a heavy Polish and Italian presence in Northeast Detroit, in comparison to the rest of the city, which was majority African American. There were also quite a few areas that were indicated as having “mixed” ethnic groups, but the actual composition of this status was not indicated. Even with this, the black presence in the core of the city is very clear and well displayed on the map.","The earliest European immigrants came largely from France in the early part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, mainly as fur traders and missionaries. Later, farming replaced fur trading as the state's primary economic activity and more immigrants began to settle. In 1825 the first wave of German immigration to Detroit began; the Irish began in 1830. This growth continued through 1890s with Polish immigrants settling as well. During the great migrations of African Americans from the south happened between 1910 and 1980 when the African American population multiplied over 100 times. Today, the Hispanic population of Detroit is rapidly increasing which started after 1940. All of these changes in waves of migration to Detroit are indicative of major international changes happening to the city in trade industries, during the war era, and during industrialization.","For a half-century beginning in the 1950s, Detroit lost nearly half of its population, almost all whites; so, there is even less diversity in the city today. Detroit has ranked among the 10 most segregated metropolitan areas in the United States since the mid-20th century.

The whitefish fed families, and the men depended upon their jobs to support their family financially. The Belle Isle Aquarium, constructed in 1904, represented a very different socioeconomic class; a class who could afford the time it takes to observe fish, both exotic and native to the Great Lakes. It is interesting to look at the parallels, and to consider that the aquarium opened at the same time that Detroit residents were fighting to keep the Belle Isle fisheries active. Today, Detroit residents are fighting to keep the Belle Isle Aquarium, now described as the “anchor of Belle Isle,” active in the face of the city's financial crisis.

The John C. Lodge Freeway was one of the many attractions gaining Detroit much of its attention. An aerial photograph taken in 1950 shows the city's complex and multifaceted highway system starting to take form. The photo depicts a portion of Detroit’s East Side along with an early M-10 freeway, still under construction. Today, construction of massive freeway systems is widely considered one of the main factors behind Detroit’s decline, and this photo shows how the freeway projects split neighborhoods and sectioned off large portions of the city. The freeway bisected the predominantly African-American Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods, and was part of a larger \"slum clearance\" campaign by the city that wiped out many low-income communities without providing relocation or other services for former residents. Upon closer examination of the photo it is clear that without a car it would take some time to get across this new structure and venture to another portion of the city. In the northwest part of the city, a large area filled with countless blocks of recently constructed houses is visible, just where the freeway ends. The cranes shown at the end of the freeway suggest further expansion of M-10 into the neighboring residential areas, demonstrating the city's commitment to the growing suburbs.","The John C. Lodge freeway was just one of many projects happening across the country that made the inner cities less appealing and added to the appeal of suburbia for those who could afford it - or those who were not excluded by segregationist housing policies. In “Beautiful and Terrible: Aeriality and the Image of Suburbia,” author D.J. Waldie showcases a gallery of aerial photos that show the construction of future cookie-cutter suburbs in Southern California. Waldie notes that the developers of suburbs like these and projects like the Lodge were proud of such grand construction and expansion: aerial photographs of the projects frequently appeared in magazines and received high praise and admiration for the future they would bring. Photographs like these had significant impacts on the way the projects were perceived by the public, and were understood at the time as signs of progress, while today many of us focus more on their more problematic and overlooked aspects.

In 1911, one reporter from the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> visited Delray in the southwest of the city, which had a substantial population of Hungarian immigrants, to investigate accusations that Hungarians were dirty and had low morals.  The Hungarian community in Delray had come under attack after it had criticized and deemed unnecessary the addition of a new Sunday school room offered by the Women’s and Foreign Mission Society and the Women’s Home and Mission Society of the Presbyterian Church. In response to Delray residents' concerns, the Reverend E. H. Pence of the church retorted that the Hungarians “had little idea of how to live in the twentieth century, a badly warped sense of morality and no idea of sanitary laws.” Naturally, this comment incited indigantion from the Hungarian community. To disprove the Reverend and those who agreed with him, Atty A. Weisz, a Hungarian lawyer, and Reverend Stephen Borsos of the Hungarian Reformed church invited a reporter to take a look at the neighborhood for himself.

However, the bureaucratized vision of it was something that was, if not new, at least enhanced in the Detroit Thrift Gardens program.  The vacant lot gardening program of the 1890s was concerned with tracking economic input and estimating output but was never quite so meticulous as the thrift garden program, which, besides its registration forms that mirrored a census data form in the nature of their queries, had an official pledge that each gardener had to sign.  The pledge laid out the ground rules for participation in the program, which included an agreement not to sell any of the produce grown, to design and manage the plot in a specific spatiotemporal manner, and an agreement to statistically track the progress of the garden plot, among other things.  Some of these pledges established a program that was much more strictly controlled than a similar program in the 1890s had been: for instance, the restriction on selling surplus produce which was not only permitted but encouraged in the nineteenth-century vacant lot gardening program.  This increase in bureaucratic management could be read in a variety of ways but something that should be considered is that while both programs were framed as a consumptive alternative for poor urban dwellers who could not afford produce the vacant lot gardens of 1893 were also understood to be a means of naturalizing and potentially ruralizing recently immigrated Eastern European populations.","It is startling what can be gleaned from the most seemingly mundane bureaucratic documents.  Often, the unexpectedly fascinating history of faceless government agencies is obscured behind the veil of boring that seems to pervade bureaucracy.  However, what is being concealed, beyond simply the untold history of the mundane, is the assumptions and social logic that serve as frameworks and operating principles for these institutions.  More importantly, the operation of power and the central role that institutions, even small-scale institutions such as the Detroit Thrift Gardens program, serve in shaping the way people live and interact with the world.  The thrift gardens, for instance, were a highly managed form of urban land-use that, through bureaucratic tools and channels, shaped the appearance of urban agriculture and shaped people’s relations to it."],"locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}]},{"id":5907,"title":"Great Depression Gardens","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/31","end_date":"12/31/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Immediately following the Great Depression, the Mayor’s Unemployment Committee (MUC) established a thrift-garden program in Detroit.  Between 1931 and 1932, the height of the program, the gardens supplied food and benefits for about 20,000 people.  Experienced gardeners would create model gardens for thrift gardeners to follow, who were either welfare clients or those near the verge of dependency.  Experienced gardeners also seemed to mange and oversee the workers and land, sitting outside of sheds on the perimeter of the land.  They were dressed well, considering that it was the time of the depression, wearing white button-down shirts, ties, brimmed hats, and slacks.

So they kept their flowers fresh on slabs of ice sized fifty to one-hundred pounds, delivered daily by the ice man. The flowers that the shop provided were similar to those you could find at the Eastern Market, grown locally by farmers in surrounding rural communities.","This all changed when members of a fleet of famed pilots from the Pacific Theatre of WWII, nicknamed the \"Flying Tigers,\" decided to start an independent business flying perishables from the West Coast and Hawaii to major cities in the Midwest.

As a florist, he was a vehicle for bringing nature into the heart of one of the country’s most industrial cities. His flower shop formed part of a network of production and distribution that linked the rural places where flowers were grown and the people who grew them with the city and its residents. At first, this network was primarily local, and was one example of how Michigan farmers and other producers relied on the city for their survival, and of the way that the city in turn relied on its hinterland. Over time, the network expanded globally, linking bouquets in Detroit to distant and complicated factors like the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands and the cost of airplane fuel.

The privately owned island is off limits to the public and there is little known about what occurs on the island. In contrast to Zug Island’s hazy present, the island had much more transparent days in the past. Located at the opening of the River Rouge, the peninsula was purchased by Samuel Zug as a potential investment. However, the marshy land made the land uninhabitable. Zug allowed the River Rouge Improvement Company turn the peninsula into an island in 1888 as a way to better connect River Rouge to the Detroit River.","In 1891, George Brady and Charles Noble purchased the island from Zug for $300,000 with plans of turning the land into an isolated industrial dumping ground for the booming manufacturing companies in nearby Delray. While searching for gas in the marshy grounds, Noble and Brady struck salt beneath their new property. A geological survey showed that the land beneath the island contained a wealth of limestone and salt. A well 1,620 feet deep was set up on the island to retrieve salt and limestone. Salt was used to create soda ash, used in manufacturing of glass, and other by-products used in manufacturing. The island’s strategic location allowed ease of transportation and made the island a desirable location for industries. in 1895, the exposition building for the International Exposition and Fair of 1889 was torn down in favor of the new Solvay Processing Company, a prominent soda ash producer. The plant was located across the River Rouge from Zug Island and on the Detroit River waterfront, serving useful for importing raw materials and exporting finished goods. The company had wells covering 100 acres of Zug Island where the salt is extracted, and then brought over to be processed into soda ash. Within a decade of the grand exposition, the grand was cleared for salt mining interests. By prioritizing heavy industry opportunities, Delray continues to invite heavy industry into the village.","While Zug Island is no longer a source for salt, petroleum coke and steel are still being produced on the island.

Complete with a cheerful cartoon of a happy, gardening family, the article discusses the success of war gardens and the spreading popularity of Victory Gardens in the aftermath of the war.  The National War Garden Commission of Washington stood behind this message, encouraging continued participation throughout 1919 and even incentivizing readers to donate funds (two cents) to the commission with the promise of a garden book for every 2-cent stamp received.  The National War Garden Commission hoped messages like this one would evoke feelings of nationalism and empower citizens to contribute to the food production effort from their own homes.","Victory Gardens, like the ones mentioned in this article, were a continuation of the war gardens, that began in an effort to help with the food shortage experienced as many young men left their farms to fight in World War 1.  These gardens sprang up in American backyards all over the United States, and the National War Garden Commission was created to monitor the progress of these gardens and encourage participation even after the armistice.  These forms of urban farming differed from many of the grassroots movements that utilized agriculture as a activism, in that victory gardens were backed and publicized by the federal government in a national campaign.  Victory Gardens were portrayed as pathways to US prosperity and rebuilding in the wake of the devastation of the war.  Many cities, like Detroit, converted vacant land to be cultivated by citizens.  In this way, the community and its members came together through pooled resources to participate in a small act of patriotism towards their country.  Within Michigan, Detroit’s victory garden design and campaigns were copied in other areas such as Hyland Park.  Cities like these used this model to begin planting gardens in elementary schools and junior highs in an effort to keep children interested and involved in the war efforts. Victory gardens would appear again during the next World War, and serve a similar purpose in both providing food during wartime shortages and bringing the nation together to achieve a common goal."],"locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1719,"tag":"Victory Gardens"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":2052,"tag":"Urban Farming"}]},{"id":5935,"title":"Zug Island, Then and Now","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-11-21","end_date":"1897-11-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zug Island is a small man-made island cropped off from the Delray neighborhood in Detroit in the early 1900s.

Today, citizens of Windsor, Ontario, Detroit’s neighbor across the border, complain of a resounding humming sound that comes from Zug Island late at night. The hum is so deep it has even been known to make people ill. They are even more frustrated by the fact that regular citizens are not permitted onto the island, so there is no way to determine cause and effect of this painful noise. Negative externalities and unintended byproducts have always been a part of the industrial history of Zug Island, but in an interesting article from 1897, the Detroit Free Press details marsh fires that spewed dust all over the city, and were not the result of industry. This shows that the island might always have been unfit for human habitation.","The fact that the site that became Zug Island was always relatively uninhabitable makes its future industrial use logical. However, the fact that people in Delray are allowed to site their homes just on the other side of the canal, shows that mixing land uses in certain regions, especially heavy industrial ones, can have major environmental impacts on the people in that area.

Despite its short tenure as a facet of the urban environment of Detroit, city plots abounding in vegetables would flourish in the public imagination for years to come. In 1908, during a hard winter for employment, an editorial in the Detroit Free Press calls for the redeployment of a vacant lot gardening scheme. It makes an appeal to the resounding success of the Pingree program and stresses the fact therefore that as a measure for reducing unemployment it would not require any experimentation. The author also points out the existence of vacant lots as a space in which imagined gardens could thrive. Almost a decade later, in a 1917 <em>Detroit Free Press </em>article, Pingree’s potato patches are again referred to as a potential solution for a city-wide food shortage.  The mayor at that time is stated as expressing his belief that a contemporary take on Pingree’s plan would resonate with the poor of the city as it would allow them to help themselves combat the famine.  Again, the success of the potato patch scheme is emphasized and its legacy is further elaborated upon.  It is evident that, far from vanishing after the termination of the program in 1897, Pingree’s potato patches lived on, populating vacant city lots with potential and imagined potatoes.","The cultivation of plants and the way in which we imagine the cultivation of plants is not a process that can merely be reduced to subsistence or economic motivations.  Labor, especially in the down-to-earth sense of agriculture, is embedded within a moral universe that valorizes the labor and the laborers and the product of the labor.  In the case of Pingree’s potato patches, there is a definite way in which the vacant lot gardening program as a historical artifact and the manner in which it was drawn on in times of perceived hardship carried with it notions about how to value the labor of the unemployed and the unemployed in general. In this sense then, the vacant lot gardening program served as something of a vehicle by which paternalistic sensibilities towards welfare and the poor were translated into different contexts and times."," "],"locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"},{"id":1904,"tag":"Pingree"}]},{"id":5943,"title":"Victory Gardens and the Campaign for Frugality","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/42","end_date":"2/28/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1942, in the heat of the Second World War, the United States Department of Agriculture published a 16-page pamphlet to be distributed to homes and families across the United States.  The pamphlet was intended as an informational packet to facilitate the successful implementation of Victory Gardens in American’s backyards.  The pamphlet detailed the nutritional, economical, and national benefits of growing fruits and vegetables at home.  It provided detailed information on what to plant, how a garden should be laid out, and when to harvest.  It gave tips and pointers on raising produce, and stressed (many times) the absolute importance of creating a practical garden that could be grown and harvested without waste and with the intent of long-term, continuous production.","In World War II, Victory Gardens were encouraged to decrease the stress on the low food supply both abroad and at home.  The United States government produced posters, pamphlets, leaflets, cartoons, and other persuasive communication media in hopes that the public would see victory gardens as a way to aid in the war effort, and as a means of uniting with other fellow Americans under a common goal.  With food and resources so scarce, the pamphlets and leaflets were used to encourage frugality, and to convey waste as a symbol of anti-patriotism and an act against United States victory in the war.  Through these communication media on victory gardens, the United States government hoped to redirect the American consumer culture to reflect the direction of the country’s wartime needs.","Many persuasive campaigns by the government have failed due to Americans’ skepticism of government regulation and influence of personal values and behaviors, yet the World War II poster and pamphlet campaign “appears to have been effective in inculcating frugal consumption habits among home front consumers” (70).  It is likely that because of the war, Americans were more inclined to see government intervention into personal behaviors and values as protecting the common good of the nation. The common enemy the war produced allowed the government to campaign for frugality with more success than otherwise. The victory gardens of World War II are a perfect example of a successful poster/pamphlet/paper media frugality campaign.   By the end of the War, nearly 20 million Americans had their own gardens and 40% of the produce supply came from home-grown sources. Pamphlets, like the one produced by the Department of Agriculture, provided Americans with the information they needed to plant and harvest crops, as well as the message of the importance of frugality needed for the nation to win the war.  Urban agricultural campaigns centered around the production of food for security and independence would appear later in American history, especially during the civil right movement of the 1960s.  Though these campaigns differed, the 1940s ideal of food production by the individual to benefit a larger cause would continue to influence urban agriculture and farming movements of the future."],"locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1719,"tag":"Victory Gardens"}]},{"id":5944,"title":"Black Bottom and Detroit's 1943 Riots","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"6/20/43","end_date":"6/22/43","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the aftermath of a riot that started on June 20, 1943 due to racial tension between whites and blacks, residents of Black Bottom and Paradise Valley try to repair their lives and their businesses.

All energetic forms of recreation were centered around the striking Field House designed by Edward A Schilling, constructed in 1898 as a bicycle pavilion, but quickly expanded to administer and facilitate numerous athletic sports. Originally available to Detroiters were baseball, an athletics track complete with hurdles, and football, expanding over time to provide basketball courts, soccer fields, rugby, and most recently hand and racquet ball courts.","A thriving sporting community was established around the park as early as 1910; Belle Isle had self-consciously become the “playground for the people” as it defined itself as a free, recreational space for all people of Detroit.

The citizens of the city of Detroit were upset and did not want to see that historic building disappear from the landscape completely. They proposed moving it to the northern section of the island. Officials, on the other hand, opposed this plan. The actual move would require the cutting down of hundreds of trees in order to transport the casino. More would have to be removed at the new proposed site. Moving it on the frozen river was not an option either, as the citizens wanted, because the current was extremely strong. The entire length of the river never completely freezes. With a lack of options available, it was decided that the old casino would go to the highest bidder, and it would be up to them to find a way to get it off the island. The administration felt that it was right for the island because instead of keeping around an old building, they could put the revenue they obtained from selling it to good use.","The critics of tearing down the old casino were on to something. Almost all of the literature on urban planning supports the idea of preservation. It is often the most cost-effective option, as long as complete demolition is not required.

Mr. Northcross felt the need to service the Black community due to a lack of hospital service for many of the Southern Blacks who migrated to Detroit. When he opened Mercy Hospital he made history by opening the first Black-owned hospital in Michigan. They begin their work by renting three rooms to operate out of until further accommodations were made.

She recalls that she was a \"great walker\" because her home was centrally located to her community, including a \"hop skip and a jump\" to flower shops, family grocers, Barthwell's Ice Cream Parlor, shoe repair shops, and more. She recalls that neighbors kept an eye on each other and their children, including her, creating a strong sense of unity in raising the community.","Teola P. Hunter, who lived on Medbury Ave., recalls not only being born into a wonderful family, but also \"born into a neighborhood\". She notes that her friends and family were people who were \"poor but proud\" and determined to live their lives to the fullest. Often, her \"family\" was not real family at all as almost everyone on the block was lovingly claimed to be one of her cousins. She also accounts how familiies would often hold \"credit account(s)\" with stores and other businesses in the community so they could get items like groceries in between paydays or if they ran out.","George D. Ramsey, Sr., grew up in a flat at 952 E. Warren Ave, between Hastings and Rivard. He recalls his 18 years of childhood there as his \"Street of Dreams\". He fondly remembers childhood mischiefs, such as peeping through the windows of Cole Funeral Home to look at the bodies, sitting of the porch of noted jazz pianist Will Davis, and jumping across rooftops at the \"Booker T.\" apartment complex. He recalls \"death and despair\" always being present though, like visiting the Astoria Bar where police once shot a man and blood stained the street until next rainfall. Still, living next to a Do Wopp group, musical greatness, and a lively community showed George that great things could be realized in his neighborhood, and he always felt satisfied.","The above accounts are just a few of the many stories shared about the communal spirit of growing up in Black Bottom. There is often the saying that \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and that this held true in Detroit's Eastside. Many previous residents will similiarly reminisice on living with \"aunts\" & \"uncles\" that weren't biologically related, neighbors reprimanding other children as if they were their own, and feeling safe walking alone down the street, even for women at night. These residents knew they were poor, but almost all of them recall never feeling poor or middle class. Within the confines of their neighborhood, many as sheltered children recall feeling rich, and as if they had everything they needed in the world (despite the area having poor environmental conditions such as disease, poverty, and poor safety in housing). Moreover, there are a large amount of documented stories and photographs on the thriving economics of Hastings Street, to which so many residental streets turned off of. Theaters, Black-owned businesses, barborshops, and dime stores, were among many of the attractions along the street. Combined with Paradise Valley next door, it has been often said that neighborhoods of Black Detroit, like Black Bottom, were \"a city within a city\", created by the heavy segregation of the time.","Environmental racism predominantly includes creating the inequal distribution and equality of space, which ultimately defines where and how people live. So while it can be polarizing and destructive (such as between Whites and Blacks within Detroit), Black Bottom and the Black community of Detroit also show how hope can be created within such defined space. Finally, they show how injustly forcing people into a certain situation can bring them closer as a united community - an important revelation for almost all areas of history and stories of oppression."],"locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1990,"tag":"Hastings Street, Detroit"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":1954,"tag":"Black Bottom Detroit"},{"id":2072,"tag":"Environmental Racism"}]},{"id":5949,"title":"The Hungarian Footprints in Delray","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/11","end_date":"12/31/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Eastern Europeans found home in industrial southwest Detroit throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. One notable group was the Hungarian community who carved a rich history in Delray. The first wave was in the mid-1800s, just in time for Delray’s industrial boom. Delray’s waterfront access and industrial nature made it an attractive location for businesses to locate. Some immigrated to America to escape punishment by Austrian authorities after defeat in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. At the turn of the century, 1.7 million Hungarians immigrated to America in hopes of chasing the “American Dream.” The waterfront industries, along with the Cadillac Clark Avenue plant, provided jobs for the immigrants and cultivated a Hungarian community in Delray. The Hungarian population was not uniformed in faith, practicing diverse religions such as Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodox Catholicism.","In 1911, Hungarian parishioners the Holy Cross Roman Catholic church celebrated its 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary and announced its plans to expand the church due to the growing need for more space. In 1920, the dense number of Hungarians in the neighborhood provided the resources to complete the Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic church. The momentous structure became the heart of the community, even after the early immigrants began moving to the suburbs. After World War I, a 1000 per year quota was set for Hungarians seeking to migrate to America, reducing the inflow for the next 30 years. After World War II, President Eisenhower set loose immigration laws for Hungarians in light of the Soviet invasion of Hungary. In 1956, the next wave of Hungarian immigrants continued to settle in Delray and kept the Holy Cross church vibrant.","Today, the red brick church still stands high in Delray, holding masses regularly.

flowers with the support of city clubs, showing the prominence of home-gardening.  Not only was gardening a communal and social practice, but it had become a source of education and cultivation among

1992, Jimmy and Grace Lee Boggs, Detroit’s homegrown, radical, activist/philosopher, power couple started Detroit Summer.  This urban gardening program was envisioned as a multi-racial, inter-generational collective with the express purpose of engaging youth in the process of rebuilding Detroit communities and growing themselves through communal, agricultural work.  In a picture of the program contained in Grace Lee Boggs’ autobiography, we see a group of youth attending to a garden plot.  The youth, representing the multi-racial ideal promulgated by the program, all seem absorbed in some task pertaining to a garden plot.  The thick gloves they wear on their hands is either an expression of their inexperience with this kind of labor or the direct effect of a well-thought out program’s intention to make agricultural labor more accessible or both.  Also of note, the plot that they are tending is not set directly in the earth but on a raised bed, reflecting the fact that the garden is probably located on a plot that was formerly occupied by some now vanished structure that still haunts the soil with its least attractive elements.  This picture tells a deeper story when it is compared to a picture from about 100 years earlier found in Hazen Pingree’s autobiography, which depicts a family enrolled in the then mayor’s vacant lot gardening program.  This photo is, unlike the photo of the Detroit Summer youth, not an action shot but is obviously stilted as the family is posing behind a sign glorifying Pingree and his gardening program.  Also, the farm plot the family is posing in seems to be much more on the periphery of the city as it is bounded by an undeveloped horizon and the plants are growing directly in the soil.  Finally, the family members, unlike the youth dressed in leisurely summer attire and sporting gloves, are dressed in what may have been their everyday attire rather than clothing especially chosen for summer weather and working with the soil.  These pictures then speak to us in dialogue with one another, showing us, visually, the manner in which a century has changed the nature of urban agriculture in Detroit.","The values and ideals of Detroit Summer were a massive departure from those that guided urban gardening programs in Detroit in the past, which often relied on appeals to either economic disadvantage to temporarily employ the idle hands of an essentialized stock of the poor or the enlistment of a patriotic public in times of need.  Detroit Summer saw urban agriculture as a means of empowering individuals and communities, and in this way, represents a broader shift in public understanding of urban gardening from a method for feeding and employing and rallying the masses to a method for developing a person who is a unique expression of life experience and identity, not a face in a mass of faces.  Of course, programs like Detroit Summer can still fall victim to the paternalistic, essentializing logic that pervaded such programs as Pingree’s vacant lot gardening program, but it is hard not to appreciate the strides that they have made value-wise."],"locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2084,"tag":"Detroit Summer"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban

The filth and litter that filled the alley ways and cramped cottages were breeding grounds for tuberculosis. Aside from the health risks, the lack of proper leisure space for children, such as parks and playgrounds, created an unsuitable, and even disgraceful, living environment for Delray residents. Dr. Herbert pointed at the Solvay Processing Company’s pollution as the culprit of killing plant life in the area. The doctors argue that the children in Delray are constantly in danger of contracting tuberculosis at school because of their poor living conditions.

Some nights, Duke Ellington would play for whites at a venue too expensive for Blacks to attend, and use the Horse Shoe Bar as his after party.

The surrounding community, established in Black Bottom/Paradise Valley to make the best out of subpar housing conditions and contained siting, was deliberately torn apart.

These industries fueled a large immigrant community, and set the stage for large-scale industrial developments on the river, with a nearby community of workers.","But the 1955 publication of the Detroit Master Plan zoned Delray as heavy industrial, and set in motion a conflict of industry and revenue over the dwindling Delray community. it is difficult to associate the change to any specific cause.

The article printed a photo of the front of the church, showing its elevated entry, tall pointed-arched windows, and the building’s rather extensive length. The church stood on West End Avenue and Thaddeus Street and first opened in 1897.  At that time, it was centered in quickly developing neighborhood of Delray and by 1911 it needed to be enlarged to sufficiently serve the growing community.  However, by 1922, the church was considered to be “in the heart of a foreign settlement” and not within the same proximity of its former visitors. The Episcopalians who previously frequented this church are cited as having mostly moved out of this area of Delray and into neighborhoods north of Fort Street.  Because of the population movement, the church lost most of its followers and could no longer be self-sustaining.

This demographic shift in Delray was summoned by the influx of factories and the availability of jobs for unskilled laborers, but as the immigrants form this phase of movement gained more skills and more income, they too would eventually move out of Delray and make way for a second great demographic shift after World War Two.  As with the closing of the Episcopal Church, Delray would later see far many more businesses close their doors as the demographics and population of Delray would continue to be in flux."],"locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"}]},{"id":5969,"title":"Detroit International Exposition Fair of 1889: Delray Before Its Industries","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-17","end_date":"1889-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","<em>Harpers Weekly</em> devoted a large part of its August 17, 1889 issue to the upcoming Detroit International Exposition Fair, which would open exactly one month later on September 17, 1889.

These grand projects were built just southwest of Fort Wayne in Delray, and according to the engraving would be surrounded by bustling activity around the pavilions as well as significant boat traffic along the river, presumably bringing in hoards of tourists eager to visit the fair. The main building was designed by Louis Kamper in style that recalls great European palaces, and was prominently placed at the center axis of the engraving and at an angle that dramatically accentuated its long, ornamented halls.  The <em>Harpers </em>article points out proudly that it was “the largest building in the world erected exclusively for fair and exposition purposes,” and goes on to boast of the plethora of industries and activities that would be represented, from packaged seeds to stove manufacturers to musicians and a painting gallery with 300 artworks. The fair would be so large that the author said the only person capable of seeing everything in a day would have to be a “professional pedestrian.”","The event jumpstarted major construction projects in Delray. The city transformed the area by draining marshlands, clearing farms, building new roads and railways, and even constructing two additional docks to accommodate the anticipated increase in river-traffic.  The fair happened at a time when Detroit was bursting with economic and industrial activity and this event solidified its reputation as a booming city. The fair did draw a lot of attention, but afterwards, the structures did not remain. Delray also did not maintain this palatial appearance. Within just six years, the Solvey Processing Plant took over the location of the main exposition building and began to dig for salt.  If we were take an aerial shot from the same spot today as where Schell and Hogan did their engraving in 1889, instead of seeing the grand halls by Kamper, we would be peering down onto the black land and factories of Zug Island."],"locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2096,"tag":"International Fair"},{"id":2054,"tag":"Zug Island"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"}]},{"id":5970,"title":"Fisher Freeway (I-75) through Delray","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/61","end_date":"12/31/61","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Recommended location and design has been developed with full consideration given to existing and proposed land use, to urban renewal and industrial redevelopment projects and plans, and to all elements of the official Master Plan of the City of Detroit.\"","As the Wayne County Road Commission points out in its location study for the Fisher Freeway, Detroit's Master Plan had written off Delray, historically a mixed-use area and still home to several thousand working-class residents, as industrial. While it would be easy to say that this is why Delray was parceled off from Detroit as a whole, the location study does not connect any dots, or point any fingers. Instead it offers what has been clear in both the Master Plan of the City of Detroit and the Fisher Freeway Route Location Study: industry trumps all.","In the end, the recommended route from the Wayne County Road Commission would lead to the destruction of 1,954 residencies (including more than 400 multiple-family homes) and 33 industrial sites. The process of determining this route involved a massive effort to balance and divide a city, in order for the necessity of connectivity. Detroit was no longer growing, but the areas around it were. And they had resources to move. In the years prior to the construction of I-75 traffic jams were a major issue and the Ambassador Bridge was locked behind neighborhoods like Delray. The project was an effort to allow for the suburban commuters to enter the city, but also to facilitate the massive flow of resources through and into the inner city.","In the eyes of Detroit, the road was a necessity. But so was their industry, and Delray was front and center in the conflict of the two. What would happen was a balance that largely favored industry and avoided wealthier communities. Alternative proposals presented in the review show that while industry and residential were considered, residential uses were obviously given less weight. Not only this but Delray represented a path of least resistance. What could be defended as a somewhat natural divide, found itself in a relatively defenseless community. The people were largely poor, largely unable to put up a fight, and unable to move.","Industries along the river were largely unaffected by construction, as were the wealthier communities. The suburbs and industry, together the tax base, were aided by the additional connectivity. But the community of Delray suffered. The highway was the first major blow to the Delray community. Delray would face similar subjugation with a remodeled Waste Water Treatment, and to this day faces the challenge of industry over community.

It was said that back when the Island was inhabited by Native Americans, there was a beautiful woman named Bell. Her father, Stick in the Mud, was a leader of the tribe on Belle Isle. One day Bell nearly drowned in the Detroit River but was saved by J. Adolphus, a white man who was fishing on the island. Bell and Adolphus fell in love and asked Stick in the Mud for his blessing in their marriage. Stick in the Mud refused to consent to the marriage, so Bell decided to run away to be with Adolphus. As Bell was escaping from the Island in her canoe, Stick in the Mud followed. As they neared the shore of Detroit, Adolphus saw the chase and took his own boat out to get Bell. As they neared each other, Stick in the Mud drew a gun and began to yell, “Bell, I’ll shoot!” but all he got out was “Bell, I’ll…” before a steam boat came through and crushed all three people, killing them and sending them to the bottom of the river. People on the shore had heard Stick in the Mud yell “Bell I’ll” and named the island “Belle Isle” from then on. This story is strange and ridiculous, however it does offer some insight into the feelings of people about Belle Isle. The desire for a romantic history behind the most natural and pristine place in the city of Detroit, one that includes Indians and excitement shows both the sentiments of the time and the natural inclination of people to assign special meaning and significance to their natural spaces.

In 1915, Detroit Free Press published a wonderful Sunday edition describing how the various foreign groups received news about the war. It detailed the difficulties the men in the boarding houses had gaining access to war news because of the language barrier.

It first started with a brief history of urban renewal in Detroit, classifying urban renewal as the term applied to programs that focused on two areas in regards to blight: conservation and redevelopment. Conservation was defined as implementing public improvements to acceptable neighborhoods and stimulating “home owners to high standards of maintenance and home improvement thus forestalling blight”. Redevelopment stemmed from earlier efforts in the city, like the Master Plan of Redevelopment set in the ‘40s that came with building Detroit’s first public housing. Blighted buildings were defined by: age, poor foundations, lack of modern plumbing and heating, overcrowding, lack of playgrounds, excessive traffic, and mixed zoning/land use. The bulletin then detailed current and future redevelopment programs in Detroit, with an explanation on each individual project, key maps, and timelines, as well as “tabular” information on acres of redevelopment and its cost in Detroit. Overall, the plan was estimated to affect 90,415 dwelling units and redevelop 7,928 acres. One of these, and also the largest housing redevelopment program noted in the bulletin, was the Gratiot Redevelopment Area, today known mainly as Lafayette Park.  The bulletin explains that the area was part of the first sector of Detroit’s rebuilding program that stood just east of the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway (under construction of the time of this publication). The plans for Gratiot Area wanted to increase dramatic intermixture of apartment buildings and continue to carry the redevelopment all the way to Jefferson Avenue. It was estimated that the area would accommodate 1,810 families, 350 in-garden apartments and town houses, and 1,460 in tower structures.","There are several important things to notice from this 1963 account. First, Detroit, like many other cities of the time, was interested in the nationwide trend of urban renewal. Choices made during this time could dramatically affect the city and its future. Similarly, it can be understood from this bulletin that the Commission genuinely thought they were aiding in improving the city by eliminating blighted areas and contributing to beautifying others that could be \"saved\". Where the Commission saw blight, high crime/disease rates, and poor housing, this account proves they did come up with some sort of plan to “fix” this blight, no matter how flawed modern and retrospective opinions of urban renewal are to us now. Today, there are numerous accounts of those who grew up in the above Gratiot Redevelopment Area (aka Black Bottom) that never saw it as blighted or crime laden. Furthermore, the line in the bulletin that announces the new development as being right next to the Chrysler Freeway shows the discrepancy in thinking of both the era and between those affected and those in power. In environmental historical terms, this lack of understanding can be described as “seeing like a state” and dealing in legibility: where those in power create a simplified rationale to centralize control (like with the redeveloping and “slum clearing” of over 200 acres of Black Bottom) without truly understanding the complexities of the area, people, or issues affected. The Commission assumed their solution for Lafayette Park and its expansion took into account all factors, despite most likely not speaking to those who lived there or including them in decisions. As history can then show, assumptions from legibility are often wrong. While Lafayette Park sustains to this day and can sometimes be considered an urban renewal success story just for doing so, it also stands on what is considered the dormant remains of Black Bottom. It replaced a neighborhood that many residents were terribly sad to see go, despite being thought of as an ideal plan of action by city planners."],"locations":[{"id":33546,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1953,"tag":"Urban Renewal"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":2066,"tag":"Building Preservation"},{"id":1550,"tag":"Conservation"},{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"}]},{"id":5978,"title":"Points of Interest in Detroit to a Mid-19th Century Visitor","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-05-14","end_date":"1886-05-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the warmer summer months in the late 1800s, Detroit experienced an influx of visitors and tourists who needed guidance on locating the more interesting city locales and landmarks. As a solution, The Detroit Free Press published this article in May of 1886 to offer assistance to the \"intelligent excursionists to [the] old city\" who wished to see the historic sites that Detroit had to offer. This detailed and thorough guide to the \"first permanent colony in the Northwest\" includes sites like Fort Pontchartrain, <em>Belle Fontaine</em> (or Springwells in the Third Street Depot area), Claude Campau's grist mill on May's Creek, Judge May's house on the corner of Jefferson and Cass, the Fort Lemoult citadel, the First National Bank building, the second St. Anne's Church, multiple historic homesteads and houses (some already having been demolished by the time the article was printed), the \"Pontiac Tree\", and many other places of historic interest. Most of these site listings are accompanied by small anecdotes of their historical significance, including a lengthy paragraph dedicated to Fort Pontchartrain and the involvement of the \"treacherous\" Native Americans during the \"great Indian conspiracy of 1763\".<br /><br /> This article gives us an interesting insight into how Detroit looked during the late 1800’s (which was vastly different than the Detroit we see today). Some of the landmarks that are mentioned in this guide are still visible today, and still attract some tourists. However, tourism has severely declined since the economic boom of the automobile and industrial period of 19<sup>th</sup> century Detroit. Also, many of the places mentioned in the article no longer exist as they did during 1886; for instance, the majority of the homesteads mentioned have been demolished and built over, and the few parts of Fort Pontchartrain that remained in 1886 have since been destroyed (the majority of the Fort was burned down during the great fire of 1805 in Detroit that also wreaked havoc on most of the city). This article makes a mention of the 1805 fire when it lists Judge May’s house (no longer standing), which is said to have included bricks from the chimneys of French houses that were consumed in the city-wide fire. It is interesting and thought-provoking to compare a modern-day guide of Detroit to this 1886 version, because one can see the differences in what was considered historically important in 1886 to today’s historical landmarks in Detroit (mainly through the landmarks that were demolished by the city, built over, or destroyed in some other fashion since this article’s publication). In analyzing a historic guide like this one, it is possible to envision the physical changes that have shaped the city into its current state via its historic landmarks (or lack thereof)."],"locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1512,"tag":"Tourism"},{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1918,"tag":"Detroit Free Press"}]},{"id":5979,"title":"How <em>Not</em> to be an Amateur Archaeologist: Early 20th Century Detroit Edition","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"3/19/21","end_date":"3/19/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ancient artifacts have always been things of curiosity and wonder for those who discover them, including Ex-Lieutenant Lamb of the United States army. In the period preceding 1921, Franklin Lamb uncovered a burial mound that was near Fort Wayne that he thought to be \"peculiar looking\". He had been the quartermaster of the fort when he noticed the mound, and his curiosity could not be sated until he knew what was causing the earthen irregularity. He ordered the mound to be opened, and discovered that buried beneath the dirt were \"perfect specimens of Indian pottery, weapons, and all sorts of utensils\". He then decided to show these artifacts to the United States war department as pieces of prideful discovery, but instead of being rewarded, Lamb was instead found to be in violation of an ancient treaty between the Native American tribes and the United States government. He was ordered to replace the items in their original state in the ground, and to \"restore the mound to its original condition\".<br /><br />To shed some light on this situation, it’s necessary to first ask why the burial mound was located where Lamb encountered it. As a possible answer, we can look to the French past of the city of Detroit and Fort Wayne. In 1710, Antoine Cadillac, the founder of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, invited four Native American tribes to the area of Detroit to aid the French in the fur trade business (a booming economy at this period of the Great Lakes region). The four invited tribes included the Potawatomi tribe, who were given the rights to settle near the fort to be under the protection of the French during their trapping season (this establishment is illustrated in the Bellin map, located in the sources below, which includes a Potawatomi label in the area of the fort as well as “ecores de sable”, or sand bluffs/burial mounds). This invitation also included an inherent treaty between the Potawatomi and the militia which gave the Native Americans protection against destruction of their burials and living encampment. When the British took over the area after 1760, the Potawatomi made the decision to leave their village for a site further along the Detroit River, and left their village and burial ground area to Robert Navarre, a former French official. The remains of the Potawatomi inhabitance in the area are the most reasonable source of the burial mound that was dug up by Ex-Lieutenant Lamb in 1921."],"locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":932,"tag":"Native American"},{"id":2104,"tag":"Burial Mound"}]},{"id":5981,"title":"Laboring for Social Purity","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/13","end_date":"12/31/13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An article in the Detroit Free Press in 1913 presents two prevailing trends in how the general population was conceiving of farms and agricultural labor at that time.  It first discusses a prophesized demographic shift back to the rural from the crowded urban centers expressed in terms of predicted census data from another periodical.  This trend is treated as a hopeful premise because the farm was understood as something wholly separate from and potentially superior to the city, which further imbued it with a restorative power when it came to the ills of life in the city.  These ills are drawn out in the second trend discussed, which is the employment of agricultural labor in the reformation of socially demonized groups such as alcoholics or the mentally ill or developmentally differently-abled.  There is even mention of a proposed program in Illinois by which husbands who had deserted their wives and children would be employed so as to provide their former families with sustenance.  This article presents these two trends in a positive light, only raising doubts about the scale at which these movements could be achieved, but does not pay heed to the manner in which both stem from a commonly-held assumption of an idealized rural wherein labor is pure and can purify those who participate in it therefore.  This positioning of the farm as an arena for social purification is contingent on the separation, in the popular imaginary, of the farm from the city and the perceived social corruption fostered by the urban environment.  It treats agriculture and agricultural labor like a prescription for an improved social and moral universe because, solving a social problem by removing the problematic elements as far from sight as possible, in this case by relocating them to an imagined rural space.","This article is a prime example of how the misguided binary between Nature and the world of humankind can become laden with problematic moral values.  This largely stems from what one could refer to as baggage passed down from the imagined space of the “very beginning,” the biblical idea of an Eden, a space of Nature that is unsullied by human input and is therefore representative of an ultimate form of purity.  Whether it is 1913 and reformatory farms are in vogue in the press or it is 2014 and narratives of urban gardens include a refrain of the restorative and reformative aspects of laboring in Nature – even if this is a Nature reclaimed from a human space – the valorizing that is applied to this false binary results not only in a denial of how humans and the natural world mutually constitute one another but also can result in efforts that are paternalistic and marginalizing."],"locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2107,"tag":"Social Reform"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}]},{"id":5982,"title":"Future of Detroit: From Blight to Bloom","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/99","end_date":"12/31/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Malik Yakini, a Detroit native, was born mid-century during the hight of the city’s production power.  Around 1960, after the “white flight” movement, Yakini and his family experienced frequent hostility when they moved into a predominantly white neighborhood.

He thinks that the most important aspect of public gardens and farming is that it will tie people together for the common good.  He states, “African-Americans in Detroit tend to have a sense of despair and helplessness that is a direct result of oppression.

Norris insisted that railroads were going to be the key to the success of the city of Detroit, specifically in the area of his namesake (the Village of Norris, today a region of northeast Detroit commonly known as Nortown), and so he was a key player in their inception and implementation throughout the bustling city. These railroads were highly beneficial to some at the time, as they allowed passengers to travel quickly from one landlocked place to another, and also ensured the delivery of goods and products form one city to another. However, the railroads have caused more than their fair share of problems in modern-day Detroit, including traffic issues, road blocks, destruction of property/buildings, and high taxes.

Elliott St. in Northeast Detroit depicts somber remnants of a thriving past.  It takes you along a desolate street with few stores; the only buildings are small warehouses, repair shops, junkyards, and a few small parts stores.  Traveling along the corridor, empty lots and abandoned buildings line the streets, remnants of a once-bustling business district.  Many of the buildings— both abandoned and those that are still in use— are covered in graffiti, with weeds growing up around the storefronts and the windows of empty buildings broken or missing and boarded up.  The Grand Trunk Rail Line, established in the area in the 1870s by P.W. Norris, which brings freight to the area, now carries much less freight traffic than it did at the height of the auto industry.","For much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Mt. Elliott corridor was full of thriving industry.  The Grand Trunk brought raw materials to the small businesses along Mt. Elliott and Sherwood, which runs parallel to Mt. Elliott along the tracks.  Most of the businesses were feeder plants that supplied parts and steel to Detroit auto factories like the Packard Plant, River Rouge facility, and the Highland Park Plant.  In the late 1970s, however, the auto industry began to move south to take advantage of the lower labor costs ensured by right-to-work laws in those states, and these feeder plants became less necessary.  Much like the rest of the city, the businesses experienced a general decline that matched that of the car companies.  Many areas were designated as partially contaminated brownfields, and taxes were lowered on the land.  As a response, Mt. Elliott was downzoned from “heavy” to “restricted” industrial, and many of the businesses that could move in were ones that required little startup capital and were not heavily industrialized— the junkyards and repair shops that are there now."],"locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1970,"tag":"zoning"},{"id":1935,"tag":"Nortown, Detroit"},{"id":2109,"tag":"Mt.

Sirovich, New York Representative, introduced a joint resolution “providing for the declaration of a National Slum Clearance Day by the President of the United States” to the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary in Washington D.C. This short bill was designed to empower both the President and the nation to realize the state of affairs currently affecting America, in which a third of the population lived in “baneful slum conditions.” Such conditions were said to have secondary effects such as high infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, high crime, and high disease rates. Protecting, policing, and serving such “blighted areas” was extremely costly to city governments and taxpayers. Furthermore, the educational monies being spent towards these areas were “being dissipated and wasted, largely because the educational benefits bestowed [were] nullified by the unwholesome home and neighborhood environment of the children.”","Private enterprise had failed to remedy such issues, and Mr. Sirovich proposed in his bill that federal action be taken by focusing attention of the American people on the slum conditions in which millions of people lived by creating a National Slum Clearance Day. Coming from New York, Mr. Sirovich first addressed the Committee by describing the conditions found in New York City, such as 200 acres of blighted land, tuberculosis epidemics, and conditions that made young women ashamed to invite friends into their homes. He assured that these sorts of issues were the same prevailing in many other American cities, such as Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis, and that a National Slum Clearance Day would prove the U.S. concern for the matter and empower people and government to care for “the forgotten people” living in slum conditions. European countries including England, Germany, and Austria, he claimed, had already eradicated their slum neighborhoods and America needed to follow suit. After this, Mr. Sirovich brought in witnesses from slums in New York City and Philadelphia to read accounts of their living conditions to the committee.","The meeting was not without touchy debate though. A committee member named Mr. Michener questioned the force of the bill and called it out for being a mere gesture instead of constructive action. Mr. Sirovich countered this accusation by noting that efforts at concrete action had thus far not gotten much traction: a bill for slum clearance proposal was pending before Congress, while in Michigan members of the House had risen on the floor demanding action, proving this issue was getting nowhere, despite being endorsed by the President. A nationally declared holiday, he argued, would move the issue forward by raising public awareness and putting the President publicly on the spot. However, Mr. Michener still denied the importance of the bill, stating, “All it means is that, whereas sin is in the world and we think something should be done about it”. The meeting wrapped up quickly and Mr. Sirovich’s final comments before adjournment were those of thanks and to conclude, “Now I have voted for millions and millions of dollars during my 13 or 14 years in the House for the extermination of corn borers, boll weevils, fruit flys, and so forth, now let us do a little bit for humanity too.”","This transcript from 1937 speaks not only to ideas of slum clearance and the beginnings of urban renewal in American cities, but also the nation at large. Through underlying tones, the transcript tells a lot about how people thought the environmental landscape shaped the lives and morality of the people who lived there. The evidence that the government had “forgotten” slum residents implies that they were looked down upon and considered lesser in society. While not noted explicitly in the transcript, this lower class of people was often defined not only by economic status but also by race.","The transcript also reflects a disconnect between the perception of slum residents themselves and the way they were conceived of in Washington. The idea that educational resources were wasted on such populations, for instance, would be angrily contested by residents, who often note that education was a primary value and means for advancement in their neighborhood.","The transcript also sheds light on the national movement of urban renewal during this time. Clearly, the issue was prevalent in Washington and reflected in cities across the country. This acknowledgement by the President and debate within Congress most likely helped shape the mindset of government officials and leaders nationwide about how cities should look and how the urban environment shapes experiences and perceptions among urban residents and the world in general. Though the American Housing Act of 1949 and President Truman’s Fair Deal would come a decade later, along with the height of urban renewal, this transcript certainly paints a picture of early thoughts of urban renewal and the idea of the need to improve urban life."],"locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":1197,"tag":"poverty"},{"id":1010,"tag":"Housing"},{"id":1312,"tag":"Disease"}]},{"id":5987,"title":"Two New State Prisons Rise in Northeast Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"10/3/88","end_date":"10/3/88","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["African American migrants who came to cities like Detroit with ambitious dreams about prosperity in the North, were sadly disappointed during times of recession in the city when there were not enough jobs available for them. As a consequence of the thousands of jobless, homeless, poorly educated and starving African-Americans in Detroit crime was high and upward mobility was low. Rather than address the underlying issues of racial discrimination, poor housing, and lack of jobs, in 1988 the Michigan Department of Corrections announced plans to build \"two new state prisons for men being built on the northeast side of Detroit.\" This massive project in the heart of Nortown, already struggling with economic decline and flight to the suburbs, was attended by strongly differing views among the community.","The new prisons, and a new police precinct station neighboring the prisons, lay directly south of several residential neighborhoods. Mildred Stallings, chairperson of the citizens' group working with the state on the project, noted that \"the flight (from the neighborhoods) has not occurred\" as had been feared when the project was announced. But critics pointed out that people had few options about where to go if they didn’t want to live next to a state prison, and the ongoing lack of resources available for the struggling community.","In response to these concerns, the state required that 15 percent of the labor involved in building the prisons go to minorities and 5 percent to women. The project was supposed to provide an estimated 350 to 500 construction jobs. Bill Richardson, a partner with the management company on the construction of the project, said the project provided an excellent opportunity for minorities, but he said there aren't enough minorities in the industry to take advantage of the situation. Minorities \"have a hard time getting into the trade unions….Because they are not in the unions, it will be difficult for them to be representative in the work force\" on the project.

As her father developed a relationship with Ray Kowalski, owner of a local Detroit grocery store, their family moved to a forty-acre farm. Wiggins spent her childhood on this farm.  However, in her teen years Wiggins moved back to Detroit.  She went on to attend Wayne State University majoring in nutrition and dietetics.","Wiggins, currently the executive director of the Office of School Nutrition for Detroit Public Schools, declares that \"in its very bones this city is agrarian.\"  The people who came to Detroit came from sharecropping backgrounds. This included not only African Americans, she clarifies, but also Appalachian whites and peasant Europeans.  From her memory, in the mid-twentieth century, everyone had a garden.  Further, she says they all had the same sort of humble backgrounds and that is why she likes Detroit.  While Wiggins’ agrarian roots developed just outside the city limits, her pride of Detroit's agrarian past seeps through her smile and tone as she speaks on her understanding of Detroit’s history.  Wiggins feels a personal connection to Detroit’s agrarian history.  She hopes Detroiters can capitalize on their history moving forward making Detroit a healthier and safer place to live.","Wiggins’ understanding of Detroit’s urban agricultural history fits nicely into the themes scholar Laura Lawson describes in the history of urban agriculture.  Lawson argues while the historical context of a particular moment shapes the face of urban agriculture at a certain time, three recurring themes remain constant: nature, education and self-help.  Using urban gardening as a means to stay in touch with nature and educate people about health is central to Wiggins' understanding of the importance of urban agriculture.  Furthermore, for Wiggins the self-help theme is even more paramount as this is part of her pride for Detroit.  Additionally, the prominence of this theme in Wiggins’ reflection on urban agriculture in Detroit also reinforces a common narrative that brings pride to many Detroiters—the narrative that Detroit is a city of hard-working and determined people."," "," "],"locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"}]},{"id":5989,"title":"Wartime Agricultural Movements and Women","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/19","end_date":"10/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The year 1919 marked the United States’s first year out of war since 1914. World War I had been won with the help of an ambitious and aggressive campaign on the home front to overcome wartime shortages through collective action: namely widespread reducing, re-using, and home-producing (such as home-grown produce and canned goods).  The nation had looked to its women to take a leading role in igniting the nationalism and sense of patriotic obligation these efforts required.  As a 1919 Detroit Free Press article pointed out, women had risen to the occasion impressively.  In agriculture and gardening specifically, women’s efforts drew national recognition.  The “Farmerettes” as they were called, even became a division in the United States employment service, a milestone for women's rights considering society's generally negative attitute towards women in the workforce. The article described gardening as a “healthy and wholesome” outlet for young women, and due to its usefulness and proven success the article predicted that gardening for nationwide produce distribution would likely continue in the future. War gardens and victory gardens had created an occupational opportunity for women, even though the article pointed out, “American minds revolt at the idea of women in the work field.” The maternal nurturing and nourishing ideologies tied to the movement (and women in general) made this occupation seem less threatening than other fields, but it served as a powerful tool for empowering women to think about their capacity to occupy other social spheres.","Wartime agricultural movements such as the war gardens and liberty gardens of the World War I era and Victory Gardens during World War II had an especially important impact on women. These movements created opportunity for women to do what they had not done before…work outside the homestead. War gardens and victory gardens challenged gender norms and started the whisperings of political and social change within a male-dominated society. Though recognized for their contributions, these occupations within gardening and agriculture were still considered by many to be akin to the home-making and family-feeding spheres women had always occupied. Yet for many young women, being a farmerette served as a tool of empowerment. The sense of community and the success of their collective action called them to consider how they might continue to shape their identities through these assimilation into different domains.

Many African Americans hoped to leave their agricultural and rural roots in the South for a more urban lifestyle in the nation's larger and more industrialized cities. Large urban centers such as Detroit strained to accommodate the massive influx of people, both economically and socially, as these cities became meccas for Southern migrants. Lester Granger of the National Urban League feared that this \"undirected\" migration would produce \"unsound social planning\" and produce large industrial centers of African American-dominated populations with little regard to the demands of labor or these newcomers' welfare. Attorney General Frances Biddle stated that there would be no exclusion of African Americans from over-crowded areas, but that conflict like the Detroit race riots suggested that poor living and working conditions and other barriers to the rural-urban transition were likely a leading cause in the uproar and should be avoided if possible.","The Great Migration was one of the \"most significant demographic events to occur in the United States in the twentieth century\" (Tolnay, 210).  Due to the use of slaves in agriculture and farm production, the South always had a higher concentration of African Americans than any other region in the country. Even after emancipation, these people lived on plantations and farms, usually as sharecroppers, and their labor and expertise formed the back-bone of the South's economy. But by 1950, almost 2.5 million Southern-born African Americans had migrated out of the South, taking their culture and agricultural backgrounds with them. They saw Northern cities like Detroit as an opportunity to leave the agricultural pasts that had bound them to the negative after-effects of slavery, and begin anew life in urban and industrial areas.  As more and more African Americans moved North, whites became increasingly uncomfortable with the \"shifting racial balance in their cities\" (Tolnay, 210). These insecurities created racial tensions, and often ended in violent conflict.","The Great Migration marked a radical shift in the nation’s economic focus, but also in its social and cultural distributions.  Even with new jobs in urban factories in increasingly industrialized settings, African Americans had a strong historical background in farming and agriculture that influenced their assimilation to this new urban life.  Successful integration from one place to another typically relies on how well a migrant or immigrant is able to use his or her previous required skills and apply it to a new career.  African Americans were forced to take the lowest-paying, most un-skilled jobs partially due to the fact that they had little previous experience in any industrialized setting. They brought with them, however, a strong work ethic, a focus on conservation and frugality, and a history of stewardship with their environment that would later influence many individuals’ involvement in environmental justice issues and urban farming initiatives.  The Great Migration marked an important transition in the nation’s economy away from reliance on agriculture, but did not entirely destroy the cultural influence from centuries of working the land."],"locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":81,"tag":"Great Migration"},{"id":1922,"tag":"Detroit race riots"}]},{"id":5992,"title":"A Daughter's Memories of Her Father's Urban Renewal Efforts As Mayor Of Lansing","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On November 2, 1943 Ralph W. Crego was elected into office as Mayor of Lansing in Michigan’s capital city. He would serve the City of Lansing for almost two decades until he was finally defeated in the election of 1961. During the long span of his eighteen years serving the city, Mayor Crego led Lansing through the 1940s and 50s - a period of urban renewal in the United States. Crego’s daughter, Jo (Crego) Hacker, was in ninth grade when her father became Mayor. She remembers having dinner with her family every night and hearing about the activities going on in the city and feeling very proud to have such “first hand” knowledge. On Sundays, her family would take drives around the city so her father could check up on things he was responsible for. She remembers going out to the east side of Lansing along the Grand River and seeing a new bridge and dam being put in to help with flooding in the area. She also remembers the feeling of being the Mayor’s daughter and having to act upright at all times. While Jo was too young to be aware and interested in the urban renewal ideas of the times or those enacted by her father, she recalls those around her being very receptive to the positive changes going on in the capital city. This included people in her neighborhood on Logan Street, where she lived next to other government officials, the editor of the Lansing State Journal, a doctor, a lawyer, and an engineer from the Lansing Oldsmobile plant. During the war, all extra funds went to the war effort, so after it was over, there was a desire to put money into improvements for the quality of life in the city.  She remembers improvements to city parks and when Michigan State University “either created or donated” Fenner arboretum where people could walk from the park to the river. Unlike her family, not all families could afford a car so she remembers walking being very important for mobility around the city center. In 1955, when her father replaced the Prudeen Auditorium with the building of the new Lansing Civic Center, Jo recalls the excitement among Lansing residents at having a venue in downtown that could bring plays, music shows, and even the circus. There was balcony seating all the way around the center and she remembers sitting in the balcony on the opening day and thinking it was the biggest auditorium she'd ever imagined!  Jo and her twin brother used to walk at night down to the center with their friends for events. Old concert records show that Duke Ellington, Gene Autry, and the Beach Boys all played at the Civic Center. Later, when Jo’s own daughter Lori was a teenager in the 1970’s, Lori attended the circus, a band concert, and a big wedding of over 1,000 people at the same location. Though Jo doesn’t remember exact reasons why it was torn down, the Civic Center - representing the height of her father’s urban renewal initiatives - was demolished in 1999 to make room for new State of Michigan office space. She assumes the trend was moving away from big activities in urban downtowns, but reflected that downtown lost a lot of vibrancy in the evenings when the Civic Center was gone.","These memories of mid-century Lansing offer both contrasts and parallels to the history of Detroit, the state's other major metropolis. While Lansing, as the capital city, sought to develop itself as a beautiful and important city for the State of Michigan, Detroit's emphasis on industry and economy seem to have contributed to more significant environmental and social complications. But both cities faced some similar issues of industrial pollution and decline. For example, in 1922, a city plan by St. Louis expert Harland Bartholomew advised the city to restrict automobile manufacturers from building on the Grand River. As we can still see today, the plan wasn’t followed and the river became a dumping ground for industry waste and excess. Just as in Detroit, Lansing automobile companies brought people into the city in large waves for employment, until eventually falling out in 1990s. Again, like Detroit, areas of Lansing today hold the remains of partially closed or abandoned industrial plants. Still, accounts from those who lived and worked during the era demonstrate that city planners were not seeking to intentionally damage the environment or scheme against certain races – an important point to remember when <em>generalizing</em> urban renewal.","Lansing and Detroit are different cities. So while one may feel inclined to think that Detroit was deliberate in where and whom it negatively affected, it also is important to understand external factors such as the racial and socio-economic thoughts of the time period in the U.S., objective data on issues like disease or poverty, and that urban renewal could mean more seemingly positive things too, like building libraries, fire stations, or city parks, instead of just dams and freeways. It is always easier to identify issues and look at events retrospectively, and urban renewal in general is no exception.","The overall conclusion that can be taken from this personal account of a mayor’s daughter is threefold. First, it offers a perspective often lost in modern day appraisals of urban renewal. Second, it shows that there were groups of people (still, likely to be those in power and in good community standing) that felt urban renewal plans were ideal for cities in the 1940’s and 50’s. Finally, it reminds us that no matter what the outcome of urban renewal plans are in cities across America today or the fact that urban renewal is often considered \"a bust\", it cannot be denied that these plans re-defined and changed our landscapes. Urban renewal both affected people during its implementation, and continues to have lasting historical affects for us today.","The dormant Detroit neighborhood of Black Bottom lends as an example of these affects."],"locations":[{"id":28155,"lat":42.5970895978,"lng":-84.3735932032,"zoom":9,"place":"Ingham, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1953,"tag":"Urban Renewal"},{"id":2116,"tag":"City of Lansing"},{"id":2117,"tag":"Lansing Civic Center"}]},{"id":5993,"title":"Pet Coke Piles, Pollution \"Sinks\", and Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/90","end_date":"12/31/90","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Coal-fired power plants have long been one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases. There are various kinds of inputs that a power plant can use in the process of creating electricity, and one of these is petroleum coke. An important factor that makes pet coke desirable is the fact that it can produce fuel efficiencies in integrated steel mills. The company that first discovered this fact in the 1900s was none other than U.S. Steel, located on Zug Island in the city of Detroit, in the state’s most polluted zip code. In a wild coincidence, almost 100 years later in 2013, large piles of petroleum coke produced in the Alberta tar sands were left on the bank of the Detroit River in Southwest Detroit, only a few miles from U.S. Steel’s main facility. These forty-foot piles of black pet coke, owned by the controversial Koch Carbon under the company Detroit Bulk Storage, shed sticky, toxic dust into people’s homes, cars, and lungs, causing many more problems than just greenhouse gas emissions. The citizens of nearby neighborhoods, such as Delray, were extremely frustrated that the company was allowed to store the pet coke so near to homes and the river, and cause detriment to their health and well-being in the process. Recently, local protests succeeded in getting one of the piles removed to an unspecified location, most likely in southern Chicago. A proposal is now pending to relocate the remaining pet coke piles only a few miles down the Detroit River. The potential new neighbors of the pile are already raising the alarm at the ineffectiveness of this solution, since it essentially moves the environmental injustice downriver instead of eliminating the problem completely.","Urban environmental historian Joel A. Tarr discusses pet coke in the context of pollution “sinks”, illustrating the national tendency to, because of economic and technological factors, “shift our pollution burdens from one media and one sink to another rather than adopting a more holistic approach to the environment”. The voice of the neighborhood groups in opposition to the piles, as well as action by the city, confirm Tarr’s assertions that society today is beginning to confront the issues of simply unloading pollution burdens onto some other party instead of changing practices to reflect the fact that no community should be subject to these environmental and health dangers."],"locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2092,"tag":"Environmental Justice"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":908,"tag":"Pollution"}]},{"id":5995,"title":"1955 Research on Community Socioeconomic Standings in Metropolitan Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/55","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1955, a publication on the “social rating of community areas in Metropolitan Detroit” was prepared in response to an apparent number of requests for such information from member agencies of the United Community Services. The information was intended to summarize and explain the standing/social position of all communities in Metro Detroit based on their economic relation to each other and “the incidence of community problems.” Statistical measures were used to determine aspects of each neighborhood: economic levels (value of homes, monthly rent, number of laborers and service workers, etc.), unemployment levels (old age assistance, dependent children, unemployed persons, etc.), and morality and housing conditions (Tuberculosis/death rate, overcrowded homes, etc.). The definitions of such criteria were largely defined and sourced from the 1950 U.S. Census of Population. The document shows that areas of East Detroit that would be considered Black Bottom neighborhood, such as Mack Ave, were below average” in economic levels, “above average” in laborers and service workers, and “below average” in “managerial and professional workers” relative to the rest of the Detroit Metro area. Information for any neighborhood or area (divided by 1950 Census classification tracks of the city) can be found in this document, including places like River Rouge, Belle Isle, Indian Village, Brightmoor, Pingree, Delray, Cass, and more.","The publication of such documents like this likely gave the general public, and Detroit city officials, tangible numbers to confirm the beliefs that many of them already held. The research proved with numbers that certain areas of the city were blighted with disease and death rates, surrounded by poor housing and factory workers, and were made up of those dependent on the government and poverty assistance.  Despite the fact that these numbers are most likely legitimate and were carefully calculated, they do not give the full story. Statistics, without proper explanation or context, can be very powerful. Records and accounts like these allowed certain areas and peoples to be defined as slums, to be used for city projects, and to be broken up when space was needed. This was certainly the case in Black Bottom, Detroit. For example, accounts from Blacks in the area commonly attest that they couldn’t get “managerial or professional jobs” despite having the skills, due to overt discrimination in hiring practices of the time. They were forced to work at low-skilled jobs in the factory, for lower wages than their white coworkers, which was their best option for providing for themselves and their family. The statistical record from the United Community Services ignored these factors, and allowed policymakers to write the area of Black Bottom off as “low-class.” Finally, the fact that the introduction of this document states that it was prepared in response to “requests for information from member agencies” instills a sense of suspicion. Was this research performed just to give insight onto the makeup of Detroit? Was it to figure out where help was needed and then aid those areas?

There were no showers or bathtubs, no furnace or central heating, and the only source of heat was a stove in the kitchen. Betty remembers family members putting pails outside their back door “to catch snow before it hit the ground and turn it into ice cream”. As a single child with two working parents, Betty was able to afford luxuries other families couldn’t, such as a piano and modern appliances. She often felt that family friends were all parents to her and knew everyone in her neighborhood and around Hastings Street. She felt safe, and recalls “seldom” locking their doors and staying up on porches to chat with friends and feel evening breezes. She recalls that her world “was small, but it seemed to have everything [she] needed”. As an adult, she was surprised to read articles and books that called Black Bottom a “slum”. She admits it was worn out and weary, but she alternatively doesn’t remember it being “crime riddled” and that it was full of personality and fun. That might be why, despite her living conditions, Betty thought her family was rich. Once she broke her piggy bank and gave out money to children on the street she considered less fortunate. When her mother walked home and saw every kid on the street with an ice cream, Betty was soon to be in trouble. By the time Betty was in high school, her family moved out of Black Bottom. Still, she recalls that while never hearing anyone call the area “Black Bottom” until she was an adult, the area and people there taught her the true meaning of being rich. <em>“Feeling rich has nothing to do with how many dollars you have in a bank or in your pocket. It’s about having a sense of security. It’s about feeling cared for. It’s about growing up wrapped in love.” – Betty DeRamus</em>","Betty’s essay account of Black Bottom in its heyday is similar to many other rosy and nostalgic accounts of the area from residents who lived there at the time. Many past residents also recall feeling safe in their neighborhood, feeling like they had everything they needed at their fingertips, and feeling a sense of community that seldom exists today, especially in the modern world that we live in. Her account also tells a bit about the mindset of the landscape though, and what it may have been like to grow up in Black Bottom, Detroit. One theme that runs current is Betty’s sheltered knowledge from the outside world. In her full essay, she writes that she didn’t truly interact or speak with a White person until she was in high school. She also didn’t feel the need to explore outside of her world, she felt rich and satisfied in the lifestyle her parents could afford her, and she didn’t realize until later in life that there was a completely different outsider’s view on the land and area. She may have known it was worn down, but she still didn’t consider it a slum or blighted. There was a large discrepancy between those in who lived in Black Bottom and those who didn’t, and some may argue, it was primarily separated between race and class. This discrepancy, and a lack to successfully merge both sides and opinions, undoubtedly contributed to the forces that eventually took over Black Bottom and Paradise Valley and perhaps is a small part of why it no longer exists today."],"locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2118,"tag":"Detroit's Eastside"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"}]},{"id":5996,"title":"Delray Property Owners Welcome the International Fair of 1889","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-05-08","end_date":"1889-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Detroit International Exposition and Fair Project of 1889 was an exciting year for all of Delray. Pre-automobile industry times allowed room for diverse businesses, a glowing point well showcased in the Exposition. The fair was a healthy combination of agricultural and industrial. Displays of livestock, musicians, art galleries, and new technology surrounded the exposition’s main building, the biggest infrastructure at its time. Among the excited were Delray property owners. Extending Delray’s boundaries and incorporation of the village has already been on the village’s property owners’ agenda. The owners believed that the Exposition will bring considerable property value increases and help their plan along. Expansion of Delray’s boundary would include all the territory north of Fort Street, the east of the city, south by the Detroit River, and west by the River Rouge. Street improvements and a town hall are also part of the plan. With several hundred thousand people projected to walk the streets of Delray during the 10 day exposition in September of 1889, Delray property owners are confident about the execution of such plans for the village. However, the proponents are met with formidable opposition by those concerned about tax increases and poor return on investment. With or without the expansion and incorporation of Delray, the International Fair marked Detroit's industrial growth and growing economic prosperity in an appropriately grandiose fashion.

This housing project was created during the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, which is significant because of his New Deal Policy which allocated money to go towards housing. However money was not always evenly distributed in Black communities.  First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a key proponent of declaring the importance of equal funds going to all communities. She was even present for the ground breaking ceremonies of the Brewster Project.","Completed in 1938, the Brewster Project consisted of 701 units in a low-rise apartment style. Although those units occupied many separate buildings, the Brewster Project was designed to foster a sense of community. It included various green spaces, which served as places for people to socialize and for children to play. The project's landscape was pretty plain -- a few trees and cut grass. Some buildings had small shrubbery in front. The sidewalks connected each building with the surrounding buildings, so there was easy access to other neighbors. Overall the area seemed to been taken care of well by residents. It was definitely not the most lavish of living arrangements, but neither was it a deplorable living arrangement, and many former residents remember it as far better than the run-down, overcrowded, underserviced neighborhoods they had moved from.","In 1941, the city began work on the Frederick Douglass Apartments immediately to the south of the Projects, consisting 941 new units in a combination of six-story and fourteen-story high rise buildings. Together, the housing development is commonly referred to as the Brewster-Douglass projects.","Housing projects in Detroit have a storied past as do the projects across the country. Many appeared to be beacons of success for a long period of time and others did not survive as long. But today, the Brewster-Douglass projects have been in serious decline for decades. The Brewster Projects have already been removed and new condos have been placed there. Demolition on the last of the vacant Frederick Douglass towers, which have become hotbeds for crime and misconduct, began in 2013.","These demolitions are painful for the people and families who lived in these places: the structures are more than just vacant eye sores to them. These structures hold special memories because it was once home. Many wish the structures did not have to be torn down and that they buildings would have been rehabilitated instead.

She lived on Hendrie Street with her parents, brothers and sisters. Her home was just four houses from Hastings (a major thoroughfare in Detroit’s Black community surrounded with small businesses). She said that “she views her years growing up in the old neighborhood as some of the best years of her life”. She explained that it was an area where people knew their neighbors and spoke to them by name. Her neighbors were also very concerned about each other and were always willing to share what they had with each other (e.g. a cup of sugar, or a dime for the street car). The community actively “looked out” for one another. She also talked about the numbers game which could be compared to today’s lottery, although the numbers game was not legal. Therefore the community would shield the numbers man from police because they felt he was a part of their community.","During the period that Ms. Lawson speaks of the proverb “It takes a village to raise a child” was personified in the Near Eastside of Detroit. It was the village and within that village/community were many neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were linked by common bonds of race and religion. It also believed that these neighborhoods were linked by a larger desire by parents that their children would live in a larger world than they had known. Many parents inspired their children to learn about the larger society, the larger world that had evaded them (the parents), and then encouraged them to go out and find or maker their place in it. Family was a paramount fixture in strong communities, it was one of the strongest supports against the injustices of inequality and racism that were present in larger society.","Furthermore community was more than an extension of their families. It was their bridge to the outside world. It was where they lived, worked, and played. Neighbors knew they needed each other in order to give their families the strength and determination to go out into the world and make a difference. This sense of true community has escaped us in many ways in today’s society and it leads to unstable neighborhoods full of residents and no neighbors.

Bill of Rights (or just the G.I. Bill), to provide aid for returning veterans of World War II (and prevent another economic crisis like the Great Depression, which the country had just recovered from).  The bill’s main provisions were to guarantee that veterans would receive several things that had previously been unattainable for many Americans, let alone veterans who often did not attend college: education and job training; loans for homes, farms, or businesses; and unemployment pay.  The home loan guarantee proved very popular to millions of veterans: in the six years after the bill’s passage in 1944 until 1952, the Veterans Administration ensured that 2.4 million home loans were given out to World War II veterans.  In Nortown and other areas of Detroit, as well as many other American cities, this contributed to the building boom of the late 1940s, as many new low-cost, well-designed homes were built for all low- to medium-income groups, including beneficiaries of the G.I. Bill.","In many cities, including Detroit, in practice, this well-intentioned government action actually helped perpetuate much of the racism that was already present across America.  Rather than guarantee direct loans from the VA, the act simply provided for loans that could be acquired through the normal methods.  This meant that black veterans struggled to secure loans from banks just as much as they would have without assistance from the VA— the VA could provide up to $2000, but not the loan itself.  Thus, as it had in the past, all the new homes that were being built simply went to white veterans, and the housing that was available to returning black G.I.s was the same substandard housing that was available before the bill was passed."],"locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2125,"tag":"housing segregation"},{"id":1509,"tag":"G.I.

Over these five years, the landscape of Black Bottom changed drastically. In 1956, the image of Black Bottom shows how it was designed in an organized way: the roads run parallel to one another, there is a clear divide between residential and commercial districts (which also speaks to intentional zoning in Detroit), and homes were built to be similar in size. The organized layout of Black Bottom in 1956 speaks to the homogenous way that Detroit wanted the neighborhoods in this predominately Black community to look. The snapshot of Black Bottom in 1961 shows that areas once filled with homes in 1956 became desolate shells of their former selves. The makings of a freeway are clear through the center of this once-lively community. Only a portion of this area of Detroit is demolished: the area that contained the majority of blacks.

The report begins with how important water recreation and usage is to Michigan, describing the popularity of Belle Isle, a “Water Oriented Park”, with 1,400,000 visitors in 1960.  Pollution made it unswimmable, due to possible ingestion of sewage-contaminated water. This problem had been ongoing for several decades: a 1913 water quality report was conducted because of the high incidence of typhoid fever and other gastroenteric diseases during that time.

A 1956 study conducted by the Detroit City Plans Commission presents a crucial comprehensive collection of facts and statistics about the current state of industry and its projected growth. In the section entitled “Community and Corridor Data,” city planners offer their definition of a community and clarify the distinctions between a “community corridor” and an “industrial corridor.” In their definitions they contend with the City’s Master Plan which states that no heavy industry can be in close proximity to community corridors. While the report is objective in most of its findings it presents the disadvantages to the City Master Plan in a much more enumerated and in-depth manner than the advantages of separating industry from residential. The study concludes in this area that it will be difficult for industry to exist outside of industry corridors.

The usual appeal of an island is absent as this industry-heavy land mass spews pollution into the air and water. In 1897, Zug Island was already beginning to cause trouble for the surrounding residents, and an article in the <em>Detroit Free Press </em>raised the first of many environmental concerns about the activities there. The reporter describes a large fire on Zug Island with ash debris that was carried throughout the city. Down the River Rouge, the “air was full of dust.”","We might assume that in our more environmentally-conscious era a mishap on this scale would go far beyond a 100-word news article in the paper. However that assumption would be incorrect: in 2011 the same newspaper reported that a bone-shaking hum, affecting not only Delray residents but also Canadians on the other side of the river, was the result of unknown actions taking place on Zug Island.","The comparison of these two events reflects the ongoing lack of oversight of the activities on Zug Island. Moreover it begins to shed light on an issue far greater than the fire itself. With problems like this continuing into the our times it becomes almost explicitly how facilities like Zug Island were placed by neighborhoods with low populations with little pull or leverage over large companies that owned Zug. These large companies saw the environment around Zug as the perfect place for running their factories without consequences.","While at times it may seem like a conspiratorial stretch it would appear that these two instances would fit nicely into concepts of environmental racism. Industrial pollution is routinely concentrated in areas where poorer and browner populations are the worst exposed.

The report's purpose was to inform potential investors about site development opportunities for a new food distribution facility. One of the main draws of this area, according to the report, wasthe neighborhood.

In fact, it would go beyond helping the local community and help the city as a whole, since the distribution center would be providing the majority of food for the city.","The irony of this proposal lies in the fact that urban renewal projects like this often helped to further degrade the city for residents, displacing them from their homes and transforming neighborhoods. Moreover, by the late twentieth century Detroit was often referred to as “food desert” for its lack of grocery stores and fresh food, and the failures of redevelopment and urban renewal plans like this one exacerbated Detroit’s problems. Studies have repeatedly found that more than half of all Detroit residents lack access to healthy food options. Plans like the 1963 report looked to address the issue of food availability in the city while bringing back jobs, but ultimately were unsuccessful.

While streets and expressways may be apolitical on their own, their placement by city planners has had a great effect on the city. In 1946, urban planners began to work on Detroit’s local transportation plan to tackle the city's growing problem of limited capacity for \"through traffic.\" \"Through traffic,\" defined as long distance traffic consisting mostly commercial vehicles, streetcars, and buses, was growing as a result of outmigration from the city to the suburbs, a trend that was increasing all over the country. Detroit planners dismissed past methods of widening streets as ineffective, but also found that adding more through streets increased “blight and decay within cities” by increasing noisy traffic in residential areas and causing people to leave. Instead, Detroit planners decided that expressways were a suitable answer to their problem. They would decrease noisiness and through traffic presence by making the highways depressed, running below street level. These new limited-access roads, the planners believed, would bring great benefits to the city.","In practice, the outcome of the expressways was not what the planners had intended. To make room for the new roads, the city exercised eminent domain to seize the land where thousands of people, primarily African-Americans, lived and worked. All of those people were left without resources for relocation, and their displacement was a serious blow to the finances of the city. As urban researcher June Manning Thomas has noted, through \"expressway construction and other clearance projects...the city proceeded to clear out its own economic base.\" Judging by the 1963 plan, it seems clear that urban planners were looking to fix a city and make it better, and never intended the expressways to have this outcome. It is unfortunate that plans like this and others were the linchpins for the destruction of one of America’s once great cities."],"locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2148,"tag":"Expressways"},{"id":1953,"tag":"Urban Renewal"}]},{"id":6015,"title":"Self-Proclaimed Flourishing Village of Norris","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Philetus W.

There is no place in the world more healthy than the city of Detroit,\" he adds, specifically mentioning the lack of \"consumption\" (tuberculosis) in the area, a disease that was ravaging several eastern urban centers.","Evans' report stands in stark contrast to the current state of affairs. As it stands today, it can be argued that Detroit is one of the least-healthy areas in the United States, both from a medical and environmental point of view. Evans mentions the lack of prosperous agriculture in Detroit, which is a concern that is still voiced to this day. The soil in the city has been so greatly polluted by lead paint, leaded gasoline, and industrial effluents that it is difficult to grow crops without first cleaning the ground, an arduous and expensive task left to city-dwellers with enough passion and drive to do it.","In addition to the poor agricultural health of the city, the health of the environment of Detroit is also considered to be problematic. The environment in the city is often thought of as unclean and unsafe due to its industrial history, which has included a massive bulidup of air pollution, soil pollution, water pollution, landfill accruement, vacant lots, burned buildings, and a generally desolate atmosphere as seen by many. Due to these (and many other) factors, many of Detroit's citizens suffer from diseases, poor nutrition, and unhealthy lifestyles that are difficult to cure without major city-wide changes. Despite the desolate outlook, there are many programs available to the people of Detroit that may take them back to being the healthiest people in America, as once touted by Evans. These programs include small-scale greenhouses, health and wellness centers (as available through programs like the Department of Health and Wellness Promotion), and the Fair Food Network, which provides Detroit inhabitants with access to healthy food and education on nutrition and healthy habits.

Among his detailed descriptions, McKenney mentions the presence in the city of Detroit of some strange earthen mounds that have been weather-worn and eroded by cattle, revealing multiple strata of bones and other artifacts.","Native Americans at the time of European arrival in North America had inhabited the land in the Michigan area for hundreds (if not thousands) of years, and had often buried their dead with mounds of dirt piled on top, which resulted in the earthen mounds found in the Detroit area. These mounds were curiosities to the European settlers: McKenny was especially excited at being promised a large human skull by General Cass, a local military leader, which had been found previously. The federal government would eventually form a treaty with many of the local tribes in the area around Fort Detroit that granted them land and protection and prevented anyone from disturbing these mounds, in exchange for Native American assistance with the fur-trapping business. Those tribes then began to bury their dead in the land given to them, but the mounds where previous generations had laid their dead to rest still existed outside of their alloted property. The mounds discovered by McKenney and Cass were probably already more than centuries old, and were surely once very important to the original inhabitants of the land.","The large skull never reached McKenney's hands. It turned out that Cass could not actually come up with the skull that he claimed to have found, which he claimed was much larger than any \"normal\" human being's, suggesting that a tribe of giant natives once inhabited the Detroit area). However, the discovery of the three mounds (mostly weathered at this point) provided valuable proof of the Native American habitation of the area in the centuries before European settlement, and also suggested information about Native American customs with regards to burying their dead in multiple layers in the earth. McKenney described the significance of the bones being uncovered, and how they were worth much more by being uncovered and studied than remaining buried, an opinion that remains a major point of contention between scientists and Native people today."],"locations":[{"id":6592,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2164,"tag":"Hull"},{"id":2163,"tag":"Cass"},{"id":2162,"tag":"McKenney"},{"id":440,"tag":"Treaty"},{"id":2104,"tag":"Burial Mound"},{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}]},{"id":6030,"title":"Cannibalism for a Nose and an Arm: Odawa Retaliation","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1790-09-14","end_date":"1790-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Thomas Gist, the son of an Indian agent in the Ohio Valley, was captured by Huron Native Americans in 1758 and lived with them for a year before being \"released\" and heading west.

He describes running into the Native people, and also their relations with the local fort and British military: the Native people would bring the scalps of American men, women, and children in exchange for ammunition and weapons. The British obviously sanctioned and encouraged this dirty work, as they paid the Native people for the scalps and even gave them alcohol in an effort to stir them to fiercer action, but at the same time they used it as evidence that the Native people were less \"civilized.\" One day, his \"melancholy\" feelings stirred by watching an exchange like this, Bunn inadvertently lost focus and forgot to watch for familiar faces among the Indians in the streets (for fear of being captured). At that moment, two Indians saw him and grabbed him, brandishing tomahawks and furious at his having escaped, with intent to scalp him right then and there. Bunn claimed he was able to calm them down enough to beg for an exchange: his life for a large sum of money. Bunn was able to procure the sum, thanks to a friend of his named Thomas Smith, who had helped Bunn escape to Detroit earlier.","Matthew Bunn's account of the vicious encounter with Native Americans in the streets of Detroit gives us a fascinating insight into life in the city in the late 18th century.

The Native American tribes in the region would prove to be key players in the battles for the land, including an attack by the notorious Pontiac on Fort Detroit in 1763. Different tribes allied themselves with either the Americans or the British, depending on their tendencies, which created tension between the tribes themselves. The British and the Americans used this strife to their advantage, including to kick tribes off of their land and using them for dangerous battles against each other. Bunn is not, perhaps, the most reliable narrator, and his depictions of Native Americans as \"thirsting for American blood\" may owe more to Bunn's own interest in crafting an exciting narrative than a true reflection of Native ideas and actions. Their involvement in scalping, for instance, derived from the fact that these Native Americans were forced to seek provisions and protection from the British and Americans after trade routes and networks with other tribes were highly disturbed by the influx of immigrants. Nonetheless, Bunn's narrative offers a valuable perspective on how Native Americans were percieved by the general public in Detroit, and their prevalence in the city."],"locations":[{"id":15297,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"[all counties], Northwest Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"},{"id":2137,"tag":"Michigan"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":2174,"tag":"British Conflict"}]},{"id":6032,"title":"WWI Success in Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"4/6/17","end_date":"4/6/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On April 6 1917, the United States entered World War I (WWI) and declared war on Germany.

Millions of people worldwide died in 1918 from the Spanish flu, and cholera and typhoid were frequent threats in the cities. At this time, the medical community encouraged people to wash their walls to help avoid disease. Painted walls were preferred over those with wallpaper because the texture of wallpaper would trap bacteria. The smooth surface of paint allowed it to be readily washed with either water and soap or a disinfectant, while wallpaper, especially given the paste available at the time, could not stand up to repeated washing. This also was an era when homeowners often did not paint their own homes. Homeowners instead relied on the expertise of master painters, who were respected for their skills and knowledge of paints. Ironically, the medical benefits of painting one's walls brought with them new risks, as these master painters often preferred paints with lead pigments.","The early twentieth century saw a large increase in the demand for lead paint. In Detroit, the national leader for lead paint production, Acme White Lead and Color Works expanded its factory in 1908, and it was soon joined by competitors such as Borydell White Lead and Color Works, Detroit Graphite Company, Ditzler Color Company, and many others. With the expansion of business came a need for workers, who were primarily found in the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Those workers, in addition to living in homes with lead paint on the walls, were also exposed to high levels of lead through direct contact during the manufacturing process. Across the country, labor unions and public health officials expressed concerns with worker exposure to “clouds of dust\" laced with lead in factories. After multiple law suits against companies about deaths from lead poisoning, industries worked with labor unions and public health officials to minimize worker exposure to lead dust.  These actions reduced occupational lead poisoning without ending the use of lead paint, which would continue to contaminate homes and soil for decades."],"locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1889,"tag":"occupational health"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}]},{"id":6050,"title":"The Delray Tuberculosis Clinic","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The booming Detroit industries of the early twentieth century brought enormous demand for more workers as more and more industries pushed their way into neighborhoods such as Delray. Low real estate prices and rents attracted poor immigrants from around the world. Around 1910 Romanians, Serbs, Turks, Armenians, Austrians, Hungarians, and others flooded into the area. But the low cost of living translated into low standards of living, as well: bereft of even the most basic sanitation and infrastructure, many of the new residents were living in unspeakable conditions. Overcrowding of large numbers of people in these extremely small apartments and houses caused overflowing cesspools. The wells that the neighbors had dug for drinking water were sunk only a few feet into the sand, in close proximity to the cesspools, making the water unfit even for washing purposes. Lacking an alternative source, people in Delray used the well water anyway, even for cooking and drinking. The area was constantly in danger of outbreaks of tuberculosis, typhoid, and other diseases common in poor urban living conditions.","The Delray community, while powerless to address the underlying infrastructural issues, came together to create the Delray Tuberculosis Clinic in order to fight the disease in Delray. The clinic opened in May 1911 to educate the people of Delray about the disease and how it spread. Shortly thereafter, when word of the poor sanitary conditions in Delray reached authorities, the city of Detroit put together a full clean-up process led by health officer J.W. Inches. The first thing that Inches did was to condemn the wells as un-usable and begin to mainline the water in to Delray from other sources. The Board of Health also acquired the Tuberculosis Clinic to carry on its work."," "],"locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1319,"tag":"tuberculosis"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}]},{"id":6051,"title":"City of Detroit Blamed for Neglect in Tuberculosis Epidemic","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"5/26/09","end_date":"5/26/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, doctors had discovered that large numbers of deaths in industrial cities were the result of tuberculosis, a respiratory disease closely linked to poverty, overcrowding, and malnutrition. Middle-class fears that tuberculosis could spread resulted in significant expenditures in Detroit, but that money largely ignored the problems of vulnerable populations in the working-class neighborhoods and poor industrial districts such as Delray, to the southwest of the city. In 1909, Dr. Leo H. Herbert and Dr. Emil Amberg scolded the City of Detroit for its lack of funding for the city's most vulnerable residents at the Anti-Tuberculosis society. They claimed that the conditions of the working class in the city were disgraceful and dangerous to the health of Delray residents. The city's allocation of resources was also inefficient: doctors were attempting to fight the disease, but the preventative measures of urban clean-up and improved living conditions that they had suggested were not being implemented. Along with the obscene amount of litter in the streets, for instance, Dr. Herbert pointed to the overpopulated housing situations as the disease's principal cause. When ten to twenty people were forced to live in a small cottage, that house immediately became a breeding ground for tuberculosis. It only took one house with small children, he warned, to spread the disease. Since children attend school they are more likely to catch and spread the disease since they are constantly in contact with their class mates."],"locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1319,"tag":"tuberculosis"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}]},{"id":6052,"title":"The Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/52","end_date":"1/1/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In response to the lack of housing in Detroit, the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects were created. Each of the six tower in this housing project was built in a similar fashion as a means of expediting its creation, as an aerial image makes clear. Located on St. Antoine Street and near Hastings Street, border streets of the traditionally African American neighborhood of Black Bottom, thousands of families called this place home. The nearby Paradise Valley commercial district provided residents with entertainment and a sustainable nightlife. The Brewster-Douglass Housing Project was the first federal housing project built for African-Americans. The siting of these projects was intentional, as it helped to ensure that African-Americans would remain in segregated neighborhoods, away from whites. Through the destruction of Black Bottom in the 1960s to make way for a freeway, these projects would continue to serve as one of the few housing options for low-income Detroiters until they were eventually abandoned in the early 21st century.","Even though the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects were not demolished along with Black Bottom, their character changed dramatically with the construction of the freeway. Those who called the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects home lost the Paradise Valley commercial district and the sense of community with Black Bottom, and many who could afford it moved to more convenient locations along with their former neighbors. Interstate-75 brought with it a shift in the utilization of the area, without much concern for what would occur to these housing projects, and caused the families to be transported out of the area to promote the mobility of whites into the city."],"locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2123,"tag":"Detroit Brewster-Douglass"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1914,"tag":"Black Bottom"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}]},{"id":6053,"title":"\"World War II Was The Greatest Setback To Negro Relations\"","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Black Bottom has been known from many residents who resided there to be a tight-knit functional black community. They didn’t have the resources that white people had in Detroit, and in their community they created the resources they needed to survive. A former resident of Black Bottom, Sidney Barthwell Jr., recalled “Funeral homes, doctors — there were a dozen different black-owned hospitals,” Barthwell said. “The Detroit black community in its heyday was absolutely fantastic. It was better than Harlem.” Barthwell’s father, Sidney Barthwell Sr. owned and operated many chains of pharmacies and soft serve ice cream shops in Black Bottom. In an interview, his father states that, “I think that World War II was the greatest setback to Negro relations in general. I think that one of the mistakes that black people made was when they thought they had integration, they gave up their own institutions. I think every ethnic group needs a place where they can get together and discuss things that are peculiar to their problems.”","During World War II (WWII) and after, Detroit was on the verge of creating an “urban utopia” laid out by Mayor Jeffries and his Detroit Housing Committee. To keep Detroit segregated, Mayor Jeffries planned to keep black people in the center of the city away from the white people. “Slum” areas such as Black Bottom were eventually razed and destroyed for the construction of I-375 like many other public housing buildings. Displaced residents of public housing were left to fight on their own. City planners promised urban housing for low and middle income families to compensate with over populated Detroit."],"locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1994,"tag":"I-375 Freeway"},{"id":242,"tag":"WWII"},{"id":937,"tag":"integration/segregation"},{"id":1914,"tag":"Black Bottom"}]}]}
