In the early 1960s, throughout towns and cities in America, Jackie created a frenzy in the media with her impeccable style. Newspapers all over the country showcased her style as “The Jackie Kennedy Look.”  On October 17<sup>th</sup> 1960, <em>The Washington Post </em>documented Jackie’s new hairstyle as the “Modified Bouffant” which was a short voluminous hairstyle that many admired. Within days, other women copied Jackie’s new hairstyle as their own. Women and girls were recreating every little aspect of Jackie’s style, forming a complete “Jackie Look” throughout America. Jackie had her style featured in numerous newspapers such as the <em>Los Angeles Times, </em>which made reference to Jackie’s style as “glamorous” and “confident.” She was an icon to all women who perceived her as flawless and beautiful. She wore items such as her pillbox hat, pearls, monochromatic palettes and trench coats, which the media documented. This signature look that she created helped individuals follow her style more closely. Her designer Oleg Cassini wrote a book dedicated to the outfits she wore at major events during her husband’s presidency. Cassini captured the influence Jackie reflected onto women through her fashion. He even stated, “… the public adulation had built up to such an extent that in the eyes of most Americans, everything she did was perfect.” Her influence was so strong on the American people that it shaped many styles and revolutionized the fashion culture of the 1960s.","Besides Jackie Kennedys fashion, her aura was looked at in a positive manner. The word “icon” coined Jackie Kennedy as an individual. Icons came from high society, which the media created from their fascination with these individuals. Jackie became an icon through press coverage and media attention of which she became surrounded by. She turned the 1960’s fashion into being “youth led” and many younger girls aspired to be like the first lady. Fashion expert Valerie Steele even stated, “Everyone wants to look like Kate Moss. It's the way women felt about Jackie Kennedy in the early '60s.'' Overall, this fascination Americans had with her was truly remarkable. She was able to turn America around as not only a style icon, but as a graceful First Lady who revolutionized the world. "],"locations":[{"id":52797,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington D.C"}],"tags":[{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":2847,"tag":"Jacqueline Kennedy"},{"id":2848,"tag":"First Lady"},{"id":2849,"tag":"icon"}]},{"id":6459,"title":"Jacqueline Kennedy's Equestrian Therapy","course_id":150,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"11/22/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jackie Kennedy sat down with historian, and friend, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., less than for months after his death, to discuss her life with JFK.  The recordings of these conversations cover of the politics and the people she encountered during her marriage, as well as JFK as a person.  While discussing the early years of her marriage to John, she states that “Daddy told him, keep her riding and she’ll always be in a good mood.”  In other words, her father told Jack to keep Jackie riding horses and she’d always be happy.  Since riding was so important to Jackie.  ","It was surprising that she married a man who could not be around the animal she was most passionate about. Jackie first rode a horse when she was one year old.  Her mother, Janet Norton Lee was a \"skillful and daring horsewoman, who won many prizes throughout the East…”  Janet instilled her passion for horses to Jackie and she would pass it on to her daughter, Caroline.  Jackie retreated to her stable at Glen-Ora, in Upperville, Virginia, whenever she was feeling overwhelmed.  As a child, Jacqueline rode and competed to cope with the bad blood between her parents after their divorce.  Vicky Moon states in her book that one of Jackie’s family member recalled that, “I did not realize it at the time, but I now believe her obsession with horses stemmed from her desperately unhappy home life.”  Unfortunately her life did not improve greatly once she met Jack Kennedy.  She joked with her family about being with a man who was allergic to horses.  In later years, she would ride to cope the loss of three of her children.  She mainly went riding to get away from the responsibilities that awaited her at the White House.  Fred Glueckstein explained that “Her love of horses and riding became a refuge from the tensions and stress of the White House.”  Whenever she felt depressed, she relied on horseback riding to provide the peace and privacy."],"locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":0,"place":"Washington, D.C."},{"id":52856,"lat":38.9929383,"lng":-77.8863787,"zoom":0,"place":"Upperville, VA"}],"tags":[{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":2850,"tag":"Equestrian"}]},{"id":6461,"title":"President Kennedy's Relationship with Reporters","course_id":150,"status":"P","start_date":"1/27/62","end_date":"3/16/65","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President John F. Kennedy accounted for the success of his press conferences to his friendly relationship with the press. His communication with them was different from any previous president and he gained admiration from many journalists throughout his career. His perspective on reporters was a give and take relationship. Coming from a reporter background, having worked for Hearst’s <em>Chicago Herald </em>in 1945, he understood the importance of a cordial relationship with the press. In an Interview with Jill Cowan and Priscilla Wear, women of the President’s staff, they pointed to Kennedy’s strong dislike of a certain woman reporter, Sarah McClendon. When asked by the interviewer if there were any personalities of the press corps from whom Kennedy didn’t welcome questions, Cowan answered, “Yes, Sarah McClendon he always hated”.  Cowan preceded by saying, “He was always very careful about answering as many questions from the right hand side of the room as the left because people kept very close figures on how he would answer them. You know, which side did he favor. And so he really had to act.... Even those he wanted to avoid, he couldn’t help it.”","A trailblazer for her time, McClendon transcended the patient reporter’s approach to Kennedy’s conferences. She went by the saying; reporters should speak the public’s mind. The voice of Sarah McClendon was not easy to ignore, and difficult to dismiss.  Her multiple attempts to catch the President’s eye were persistent and determined in getting information not only she wanted, but Americans too. During President John F. Kennedy’s January, 1962 press conference held in Washington DC, McClendon questioned the loyalty of two officials who had been tasked to reorganize the Office of Security in the State Department. She saw them as security risks, but had no substantial foundation of evidence to properly criticize the two officials. Writing for the Washington Post, the author of this article sided with Kennedy, believing the President should be forewarned of unwarranted questions, like McClendon’s, to prevent damaging the President’s reputation. Beyond the President, even fellow reporters were apparently irritated by McClendon .","Sarah McClendon could not stand to be overlooked. there were definitely some press Kennedy preffered over McClendon which was seen through his rude responses to her, but in order to appease to all sides he could not neglect her questions. He would often take calls froma all sections of the room however, when he heard McClendon's voice he reluctantly let her pose a question. Kennedy understood his image was on the line  and often times rebuked her unrefined inquiries. Kennedy used th epress to his advantage, and did not want someone like McClendon ruining his reputation. ","Kennedy had a special relationship with some members of the press and relied on them before and during his Presidency. However, Kennedy used his political stature as a way to manipulate the media. He remained in continuous contact with the press in order to promote and maintain a trustworthy image. His familiarity with the media ultimately helped in overcoming the Republican controlled press. Reporters like McClendon posed a threat to Kennedy by her aggressive questions, which Kennedy had no interest in, but that did not stop McClendon."," "," "," "],"locations":[{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":2852,"tag":"Sarah McClendon"},{"id":2853,"tag":"Reporters"}]},{"id":6477,"title":"Letters of Eleanor Roosevelt and John F.

Kennedy a Democratic Presidential candidate composed a personal letter to Eleanor Roosevelt. He wrote, “I note from the press that on last Sunday afternoon, December 7, on the ABC television program College News Conference, you stated…that Senator Kennedy’s ‘father has been spending oodles of money all over the country and probably paid representatives in every state by now.’” Kennedy wrote this letter to Roosevelt hoping she would retract her statement. On December 18, 1958 Roosevelt’s response to Kennedy included the pointed remark that, “building an organization is permissable [sic] but giving too lavishly may seem to indicate a desire to influence through money.” Roosevelt additionally responded to Kennedy’s letter that if the information turned out to be false, she would gladly state so but, “was told that your father said openly he would spend any money to make his son the first Catholic President of this country.” Kennedy, enraged that Roosevelt believed such a fabrication, wrote her a pointed response. According to Allida M. Black, “Kennedy knew that he needed as much party unity as he could muster to win a very close election…Eleanor Roosevelt’s support was crucial.” Kennedy wrote in more of a lecture style on December 29, that Roosevelt should not believe the allegation made against him. “I am aware…that there are good many people who fabricate rumors and engage in slander about any person in public life. But I have made it a point never to accept or repeat such a statements unless I have some concrete evidence of their truth.” In Kennedy’s letter to Roosevelt on January 22, 1959 he stated, “I do hope that we a have a chance to get together sometime in the future to discuss other matters.”  These matters included his Catholicism, and attitude towards McCarthyism.","After the convention in July 1960, when Kennedy won the nomination, Roosevelt gave her halfhearted endorsement to Kennedy. Gary Donaldson disclosed, “Stevenson, Truman, and Eleanor Roosevelt might have thrown their support to just about anyone to keep Nixon out of the White House…Without their support…Kennedy would have a difficult time winning in November.” The importance of Roosevelt publically supporting the Democratic presidential nominee was symbolic because she was arguable as the “Mother” of the Democrat Party in the White House.Roosevelt and Kennedy’s relationship started off argumentative, but progressed into a friendly association. Roosevelt aimed to ensure that her husband’s New Deal legacy continued the Democratic party. She did not trust Kennedy. She remained suspicious of his Catholicism, his lack of criticism of Senator Joseph McCarthy, and she disliked his father, Joseph Kennedy’s, financial meddling in the campaign.  At the time that Kennedy wrote the letter to Roosevelt, she supported the two-time presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as the leading Democratic figure. Roosevelt liked the main points that Kennedy made in his inauguration speech about challenging the nation. Roosevelt felt passionate about the Peace Corps, but scolded Kennedy for his impulsive actions. She did not appreciate how Kennedy dodged civil rights because it coexisted as “the domestic matter closest to her heart” and “angered her the most.” Roosevelt, “strongly supported Stevenson’s appointment to the ambassadorship of the United Nations.” Finally, according to Black, Kennedy asked, “her to chair his Presidential Commission on the Status of Women.” Roosevelt attempted to influence Kennedy opinion in a variety of ways, and stayed pro-active in many organizations throughout her last 20 months alive."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2469,"tag":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

Kennedy signed Executive Order 10924 which stated the United States Peace Corps held a mission “to promote a better understanding of Americans and to foster a better understanding of other cultures among Americans at home.”   The Kennedy Administration created the Peace Corps as an agency in the State Department with the goal of training American men and women to serve in economic aid programs in countries around the world.  Through the signing of Executive Order 10924, President Kennedy simultaneously tried to spread good feelings of western democracy to amenable third world nations and increase the global experiences of young Americans through service.","In October 1960, Kennedy introduced the idea of a Peace Corps in an overnight trip to the University of Michigan less than a month before the 1960 election.  He proposed the idea of students spending their post-college years in suffering countries to recognize that there was a greater purpose in life than gaining an economic advantage at home.  While thousands of Americans joined the Corps, mixed reactions from countries around the world arose.  Despite the variety of responses to the establishment of the Peace Corps from the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, President Kennedy gave the United States an opportunity to market itself as a leader in global public service. ","Journalist Michael Hall of the <em>Journal of Third World Studies</em> viewed the U.S. Peace Corps as “an instrument of Cold War policy,” and thought it helped improve the international view of America and its relationships and intents in third world countries.  Hall, who examined the long-term impact of the American agency forty-six years after its establishment, also called the Peace Corps a “powerful symbol of American values.”  Hundreds of thousands of Americans changed their lives through their service in the Peace Corps.  Troy Moon of the <em>Pensacola News Journal </em>found evidence of life-changing service among Peace Corps veterans in Florida.  They felt that they answered the call to serve from Kennedy.  Janet McIndewar, a former volunteer, stated that “the real goal [of the Peace Corps] is to bring back what you learn and share it with people [in the U.S.].”  Those volunteers developed an appreciation for their work and even found that it transformed their lives when they returned to the states.  McIndewar’s son even joined the Peace Corps after being inspired by his mother’s work.  According to Hall, sixteen months after the signing, 2,816 volunteers were serving in twenty-eight host countries across four continents.   "],"locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"}]}]}
