In an article titled The ‘Woman’ Playwright Issue Gayle Austin, 80s playwright and journalist, expressed that many of the female characters portrayed in the shows of this time were flat or two-dimensional, leaving the female audience in this male dominated world wanting more than the typical “hooker with a heart of gold” trope that satisfied the male gaze. Plays like Da, an Irish comedy that focused on a man’s relationship with his father, or the musicals like Pippin, a story of a boy turning into a man while finding his way in the world, captivated audiences while not having a single multidimensional female character in the entire script. When women playwrights attempted to combat this lack of representation with their own creations, they were met with ridicule from male critics that considered their work “juvenile and substandard” to the male playwrights. Female playwrights like Wendy Wasserstein and Caryl Churchill faced an issue in their medium as many of them were barred from publishing and producing their work due to the constant harsh criticism.","It wasn’t until the early 1980s that a wave of feminist playwrights began releasing their work and women began to gain real representation on the live stage. Smaller production companies such as The Monstrous Regiment began producing the plays to showcase these feminist playwrights and express to the oppressive male critiques that these shows were relevant to audiences. Across the country, audiences began to show support for this new female role as women were being expressed as someone with emotion and ability, rather than the previous types of roles produced by male writers. Wendy Wasserstein, author of Uncommon Women and Others, as well as Caryl Churchill, author of world renowned play Top Girls, made waves in the world of theatre, leading a new feminist era of theatre itself.","The main goal of these female writers was to change the theatrical climate for the better; to see women actresses get to become women directors, playwrights, and producers. Austin expresses a common myth thought about female writers that came out of the theatre community, stating “Women can’t direct. It’s not part of our childhood training. Directors must be able to command, declaim, dictate, shock, humiliate, create, destroy, and resurrect.” This common thought originally barred the female world from directing as their will is thought to not be strong enough for the job. ","What was once the question of, (Austin 1983)“is this female character really a person?” evolved into the astounding creation of characters such as Muffet De Nicola, a woman who is just finishing college and questioning whether or not it was worth it and what life will be after it all in Wasserstein’s Uncommon Women and Others, or the savvy business woman Marlene, who began to adopt toxic male traits to climb the business ladder in Churchill’s Top Girls. These women now have interests beyond men or devilish schemes, or even implied lives beyond the show’s plot. This was a rarity before the Feminist Theatrical Movement. Thanks to the efforts of the few female playwrights, it is now and forever common in many shows across America."," "],"locations":[{"id":52989,"lat":40.672670386386,"lng":-73.961707701296,"zoom":11,"place":"New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3679,"tag":"Feminist Theater"},{"id":619,"tag":"Second Wave Feminism"},{"id":2471,"tag":"20th Century"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"},{"id":627,"tag":"Theater"},{"id":955,"tag":"Theatre"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"}]},{"id":6875,"title":"Josephine Baker: Civil Rights Hero or a Threat to American Democracy?","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"2/3/52","end_date":"2/3/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" “Ladies and gentlemen believe me when I say that it makes me profoundly happy...it makes my heart swell with pride to see in this beautiful audience tonight, salt and pepper...I mean by that colored and white brothers mingling.”1  Josephine Baker, famed exotic dancer, gave a powerful homecoming speech to St. Louis, on February 3, 1952, stating how proud she was to see a mixed audience of “salt and pepper.” This was a landmark moment, a mixing of races in complete defiance to the Jim Crow laws. She had been invited by many civil rights groups as well as John F. Kennedy to return to join in the effort to fight discrimination and racism that was seen a normal part of American life during this time. Josephine Baker loudly voiced dreams of equality and acted against discrimination throughout her carrier, and because of this she was viewed as a radical by those opposed and “the FBI regarded Baker as a threat and a danger to America and America’s international image and reputation.” 2 Josephine was not conventional entertainer, with her opposing views to Jim Crow laws, the government saw her as a threat. The FBI was concerned with the promoting democracy and Josephine did not fit into this idea. She was accused on multiple occasions by the press of being a communist. Josephine met resistance in general public majority due to being an eccentric highly vocal black woman, but she was a hugely important figure in the fight against discrimination. "," Baker’s return to St. Louis was a powerful moment, she was returning to her hometown from which she ran away from “because of the terror of discrimination.”1 She had vowed that she “would not appear in any city where her people could not come see her.”1  Baker was met with mixed reactions from the American public. Some felt she was a hero fighting for civil rights, while others believed she was a radical trying to promote equality between races because at this time segregation was view as part of normal. Her refusal to perform in segregated venues won her support from the NAACP. Both the American Press and the African American Press, “regarded [Baker] as eccentric and risqué and as a troublemaker who often articulated threatening political views.” 3 During the 1950s, she became more politicized, speaking out against discriminatory practices and “became labeled a threat to American democracy.”2 The FBI compiled extensive files, “constructing of Baker, they sexualized, racialized and politicized her, using the media sources which had participated in deconstructing of the star by rendering a polemical profile of Baker.” 2 "," Baker, theatrical and eloquent, voiced a warning to her St. Louis audience, “try to love one another before it is too late. Don’t let the same thing happen to America through hate and misunderstanding that happened to Germany.” 1 Baker never backed down and voiced against what she knew was wrong. She lived an unapologetic life, she stated, “I have been very proud of my start, because it has made me remain human.” 1 Josephine Baker died April 1975 leaving behind a legacy of triumph and challenged the American ideals of African American women. "],"locations":[{"id":53204,"lat":38.604731164363,"lng":-90.257197935671,"zoom":11,"place":"St. Louis, Missouri, United States."}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":225,"tag":"Jim Crow"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":3450,"tag":"josephine baker"},{"id":2860,"tag":"Equality"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":3680,"tag":"radical woman"},{"id":3681,"tag":"shero"},{"id":3682,"tag":"salt and pepper"},{"id":3683,"tag":"not nazi"}]},{"id":6883,"title":"Women Go Unrecognized in the Brown Berets","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"2/25/70","end_date":"2/25/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Aron Mangancilla, the Minister of Education of the Brown Berets, received a letter in February 1970 that expressed women’s discontent of their treatment within the Brown Berets. The Brown Berets are a paramilitary group that advocated for Chicano rights during the Chicano Movement in the 1960s and 1970s- a time of political unrest throughout the United States due to the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. Despite many Chicana members filling crucial roles within the Brown Berets, they went largely unrecognized for the support they provided to the organization because of their gender.","The letter clearly conveys the women’s frustration. The offenses include, “a great exclusion on behalf of the male segment,” and that they had “been treated as nothings.”[1] This sentiment was not exclusive to one age group, area, or level within the organization. Women in the Brown Berets fulfilled positions at every level of the organization, but they were often expected to fulfil subordinate roles like making food or having sex with members in the male-centric organization. They filled more common roles like “fundraising, answering phone calls, writing letters, pasting up and writing for the newspaper, and running the Free Clinic,”[2] which were essential to the organization. Even Gloria Arellanes, the Minister of Finance and Correspondence of the Brown Berets, a person within the top level of leadership, experienced this sexism.","Additionally, (and perhaps the strongest statement from the letter) they felt that within the Brown Beret organization, “men have oppressed [them] more than the pig system has,”[3] and that this atmosphere within the organization was not going to change. From outside the organization, “women were also harassed and arrested for their participation.”[4] Regardless of their contributions to the organization and risk, they weren’t acknowledged for their efforts because of their gender because of the machismo attitude within the organization. As a result, the letter was the official resignation of not only Gloria Arellanes but also all Brown Beret women. They had left to form their own organization.","The Brown Berets became a large group throughout the American Southwest and had many members, both male and female. Without the contribution of women at all levels, the Brown Berets would not have been able to function as effectively as they did for the brief period they were active during the mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century. Because of their efforts as an organization, they helped students receive better education in Los Angeles through a series of walkouts, protested police brutality against Mexican Americans, and provided health care to underserved communities, a feat that would not have been possible without their support network. Because of their gender, they did not receive the same credit as their male counterparts for the work, which is still largely unrecognized today."],"locations":[{"id":53209,"lat":37.429903695878,"lng":-122.18019688942,"zoom":10,"place":"Palo Alto, California"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3689,"tag":"Chicano/a"},{"id":3690,"tag":"Brown Berets"}]},{"id":6884,"title":"The Legend and Lesbian Visibility Movement created by Dyke TV","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/93","end_date":"1/31/03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Now is the perfect time to join Dyke TV’s membership roster and join hundreds of lesbians around the country who are making Dyke TV happen”.2 The original Dyke TV subscription letter from 1994 was sent out by the station’s creators: Ana Maria Simo, Linda Chapman and Mary Patierno. These three women fought against the mass media in order to portray real-life lesbians on television, instead of the stereotyped version of lumberjack women who lusted after white married women. Through Dyke TV, they were able to do segments on various aspects of lesbian life, such as: Lesbian Health, Workplace, Street Squad’s “Dyke on the Street”, and I Was a Lesbian Child, where adult women would narrate their childhood photos to the audience. As these segments made their way into the homes of thousands of Americans across the country, they played a massive role in opening the virgin eyes of some to the idea that it was acceptable to be a lesbian. Dyke TV reminded some that they had the right to not only be tolerated, but to be accepted, respected and loved, no matter their sexuality.  ","Dyke TV played an integral part in the lesbian visibility movement. “The political moment of identity politics is over. Now it is time for people to come together”.1 The main purpose of creating Dyke TV was not to create an institution, but a single political movement that lesbians and other individuals could get behind who had been previously left out of alternative movements. Though the lesbians remained in their positions fighting for the rights of others, they also demanded their own political liberation, sexual liberation and liberation in all forms for themselves.  ","While Dyke TV ended airing its shows in 2003, it had lived up to its goal and motto, “to incite, provoke and organize”.2 Dyke TV assisted in the organization and operation of multiple protest marches about the lack of lesbian rights in America. They marched in New York City, Washington D.C., London, Germany, San Francisco, and Seattle. Because of Dyke TV, many lesbians who felt that they did not belong to or in a movement finally had a voice that was heard by the public and gained support by other movements, eventually leading the way to the creation of the LGBTQ+ political movement and group that lives today.  "],"locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"}],"tags":[{"id":3287,"tag":"Lesbian"},{"id":3691,"tag":"Dyke TV"},{"id":3692,"tag":"LGBTQ+"},{"id":3693,"tag":"Lesbian Visibility"},{"id":3694,"tag":"Lesbian Movement"},{"id":3695,"tag":"New York Marches"}]},{"id":6890,"title":"Women and the 21st Amendment","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"12/18/17","end_date":"12/5/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Women and Prohibition","It is not a new discovery that women have played a significant role in changing the face of America. For example, women pushed desperately to pass the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment (1933) repealing the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment (1919); prohibition. While previous women desperately fought to create the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, none of them truly sought through the possible consequences its implementation could entail. Hence, a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was sought not long after.","            The initial plan women created, the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, was in attempt to “take back the home”. What I mean by this is that women believed that alcohol was the cause for their husbands being drawn away from the home all day, only to come home late and do very awful things to her.[1] In addition to this, women who were suffering from drunken husbands teamed up with the groups of religious people such as the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and males who could vote.[2] With strong effort they were able to successfully pass the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Over the years following, some women continued to celebrate while others began to see a change in light.","            The reason for this is as follows. While alcohol became illegal to sell, it did not prevent people from getting their hands on it and consuming it anyways. Another thing women noticed after the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment was that bars were no longer regulated. This meant they could stay open however late they please and let whom ever they want in. This allowed for the creation of “speak easies” which were basically the old bars but were now being used primarily for illegal actions such as selling black market alcohol. Some other things came from this as well.[3] These included an increase of prostitution, increase in youth drinking, increase in political/government corruption, increase in death, and also did not put an end to most husband’s violent actions.","            Because of these consequences, it was time for action, and action came in the form of a group of strong-willed women. For example, The WONPR, Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, was a women’s organization in support of the soon to be 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Importantly to note, this organization did not want to segregate political parties or previous movement organizations. Due to this, WONPR claimed over 1.2 million members at the beginning of 1933. One thing this organization campaigned on was “the repeal of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment is not defeat”.[4] This was in attempt to show 18<sup>th</sup> amendment prohibition supporters that their actions were in good means, and that it is not a loss but rather a creation for a better, safer way.","Another organization of powerful women who played a role in the creation of the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was the Women’s Organization for Prohibition Reform. For example, Ione Nicoll, secretary of WOPR, saw the destruction of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment and began to look for ways to repeal it. Nicoll frequently brought up that instead of eradicating the evils people faced, prohibition made it worse.[5] To further show her reasonings for why women “should vote wet”, Nicoll explained a study done in 1925 by the Women’s National Republican Club. This study concluded that out of the vast variety of women they surveyed, ninety percent voted to get rid of or make changes to the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Not only did she use facts to back up her reasonings for a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment, she also tried to get female Prohibitionists on her side like the WONPR did.","Though some of the Prohibition supporters were scarred by experiences, others began to see a new light that shined on the creation of a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Overtime these groups of women were able to gain mass support and became successful at repealing prohibition. With one of the campaign tactics being creating alliances, women in the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment were able to get the government, as well as others, on their side. Once this occurred, rapid changes began and the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was created."," "," ","Reference List:","Nicoll, Ione. \"Should Women Vote Wet?\" <em>The North American Review</em> 229, no. 5 (1930): 561-65. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.\">http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.</a>","Rose, Kenneth D. 1996.

She was put on the stand by the prosecution because she and her husband, Julius, were charged with espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union. The trial lasted a month. The Rosenbergs refused an offer of life imprisonment if they pled guilty. As a result, they were executed by electric chair in 1953. It was during the height of McCarthyism that the guilt of Ethel and her husband would come into question as they had been widely believed to have been framed.[2] It is understandable that the guilt of a couple like the Rosenburgs, an all-American family with two children and acted like a regular American family by all accounts, would have been called into question during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s because no one in America would want to think that during a time of intense fear and paranoia like the Cold War that an all-around all American couple would go against the nation they were citizens of in order to support the Soviet Union and follow the beliefs of the, at the time, communist Russia because all that did was make everyone extra paranoid about secret communists being everywhere secretly watching what the American people.","According to the FBI’s Vault on Ethel Rosenburg, during the trial, her attorney would ask the jurors in his opening statement, “to not condemn her merely because David Greenglass was a confessed conspirator. He stated that she had protested her innocence from the beginning and that she was dragged into the case by the machinations of the Greenglasses, who wished to lighten their burdens.”[3] Mr. Greenglass, in his testimony against Ethel and Julius, would state, “Ethel told Ruth [wife of David Greenglass] that David was working on the atom bomb project at Los Alamos, and they wanted him to give information concerning the bomb. Ruth told the Rosenbergs that she didn’t think it was a good idea and declined to convey their requests to David. Ethel and Julius then told Ruth that she should at least tell David about it and see if he would help. Julius pointed out that Russia was an ally and deserved the information, and that Russia was not getting all the information that was due her.”[3] Whether or not Ethel Rosenburg was actively participating in acts of espionage for the Soviet Union concerning the atom bomb is difficult to prove as she was not at all cooperative with the FBI during the investigation or the courts during trial."],"locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":2,"place":"New York City"},{"id":53217,"lat":35.8800364,"lng":-106.3031138,"zoom":2,"place":"Los Alamos New Mexico"}],"tags":[{"id":3705,"tag":"The Cold War"},{"id":3704,"tag":"Ethel Rosenberg"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":3703,"tag":"Cold War America"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"}]}]}
