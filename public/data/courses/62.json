In 1834, the Boston Evening Transcript reported an act of arson that broke the line between civil unrest - in the form of protest - and violence, when the Charlestown Convent was burned to the ground. Near eleven o’clock on 11 August, arsonists gave warning to the inhabitants of the convent, allowing them time to escape. Throughout the compound, the assailants had placed tar-barrels that were set ablaze to bring the Convent and it’s secondary buildings to the ground – destroying all that was contained inside.","<br /> The arsonists represented the growing contingent of Americans who considered themselves “Natives,” the rightful Americans tasked with resisting a foreign invasion. These Nativists, compromised of a protestant majority, looked towards the new Catholic Irish immigrants as targets for their oppression. Throughout the nineteenth-century, the US economy was greatly affected by the influx of these Irish immigrants. This new labor force that was willing to work for cheaper wages marginalized the workforce already present. The native group of workers sought retribution as the new Irish immigrants were taking their jobs away, targeting the predominantly Catholic culture and attempting to pressure its institutions into acquiescence.","<br /> The events at the Charlestown Convent represent the acts of violence and intolerance that spread throughout the remainder of the nineteenth-century.

On October 19, 1932, Second Lieutenant Ralph Hurst wrote to his commanding officer Brigadier General J.C. Parsons about the “Communist Agitation” in Birmingham. The International Labor Defense had recently moved its Southern headquarters to Birmingham and there had been trouble ever since. According to Hurst, the police had originally arrested communist agents and disbanded their meetings. During one of their raids, they found correspondence that indicating that the communists in Birmingham had been “instructed to concentrate on Negroes in the South.” The communist agents had held two meetings that Blacks and Whites attended.  According to Hurst, Communists advocated social and political equality between the races and adopted resolutions calling for “abolition of poll taxes, enfranchisement of every resident without respect to color or other qualifications” and urged both black and white families to go out and take what they needed. Communists also took aim at capitalists who “exploited whites against blacks and vice versa.” The infamous Ku Klux Klan broke up the second of these meetings with “malodorous bombs” and announced that “The Klan Rides Again” and would “stamp out” communism. Hurst concluded his letter by telling Parsons that the communists were “playing a shrewd game of capitalizing on unemployment and adverse conditions” to gain supporters. He warned that unless relief facilities are sent “there is a likelihood of some disorders and attendant violence.”","Hurst proved to be correct. Anti-communist violence began to increase around this period and lasted until the end of the decade. Historian Robin Kelley attributes the rise in violence to the fact that communists promoted equality between the races. According to Kelley, anti-communists used racism to fight against and hinder the communist cause. White-supremacy groups, like the Ku Klux Klan and White Legion, and racist politicians played on the Southern fears of racial equality to ostracize communists. Another historian, Robert Ingalls takes a different perspective on the issue. Ingalls believes that the most important factor in anti-communist violence was the big businesses that economically dominated Birmingham. Ingalls focuses on the Tennessee Iron, Coal and Railroad Company (TCI). By the end of the 1930s, the La Follette Senate Committee found enough evidence to show that TCI had been sponsoring violence against communists. For Ingalls, the real cause of the violence was “establishment attitudes towards labor” that kept the elite in power. From Hurst’s letter, it seems that both factors, racism and big business capitalism, were at work to limit the communists’ acceptance in Birmingham."," "],"locations":[{"id":24062,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}]},{"id":5217,"title":"James Nelson Makes Plea to the City","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/80","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["He called it a \"rape of history.\" <em>Birmingham News</em> art critic James Nelson made this charge as part of his plea to the citizens of Birmingham to save the historic Fox building. The Fox once housed one of the city’s many theatres; however, that was not the reason Nelson wanted to save it. The building was an architectural marvel and a structure he believed was Birmingham’s equivalent to Chicago’s Old Water Tower, the only standing structure after the Great Chicago Fire. The building was built in the Italian Renaissance palaccio style. With three floors, each separated by a cornice rib that could be seen from the street. Built by an early mayor of Birmingham, the building had architectural, social, religious and political significance; however, its close proximity to the Central Business District and lack of interest in revitalizing downtown, made the building a prime target to be torn down.","Throughout the late summer and early fall, <em>The Birmingham News </em>ran stories on the back-and-forth court battle that was taking place. Finally, the newspaper reported United States District Judge U. W. Clemon ruled that the building could be demolished after a long and excruciating grassroots effort to save the building failed. The judge’s ruling stated that the preservationists had waited too long to file a suit to save the building. Even though there was an effort to save the building, the Judge said that there was a severe lack of interest in restoring the building. Instead, he said, the Fox building had been an unoccupied eyesore in the city for years. In its place was to stand a branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.","According to John Poole, author of “The Federal Theatre Project in Georgia and Alabama,” Birmingham’s explosive growth at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century led to its citizens caring more about economics than history. Poole’s theory has proven true with the demolition many historic buildings in Birmingham to make way for new buildings and parking lots that will be more practical to the city. Because of this, Birmingham lost many pieces of its history. Future generations will not have as many architectural marvels as past generations had to rejoice over.

Among the nearly 200,000 men preparing to engage in battle, just under two thousand were Irish Americans. These men, new to the land, had been conscripted into service almost as soon as setting dry-foot upon US soil. Despite the Irish immingrants' recent arrival, they were more than ready to fight. Thomas Galley described the Irish Brigade on the eve of battle coming “out from the city in glorious file, their green sunbursts waving…\" In his account every man had \"a sprig of green in his cap and a half-laughing, half murderous look in their eyes.” Galley's chronicle demonstrates how the men of this Irish unit instilled fear into anyone who would dare form ranks against them.","<br />In December of 1862, the US Civil War was in full swing. Throughout the ranks of Union forces, Irish immigrants were segregated into their own units. These soldiers were a unique breed of individual. An atmosphere of myth lay centered around the Irish soldiers of the Civil War. For the Americans who were fighting, they understood the causes of war. However, many of the Irish, having no knowledge of American politics, neither understood the war nor the reasons for which they were fighting and dying. Because of this, the American-born soldiers admired the willingness of the Irish immgrants to fight and die for a cause that was not their own. Galley describes the Irish rank's death-march as they attacked an entrenched enemy position and became the target of Confederate volleys: “they passed just to our left, poor fellows, poor, glorious fellows, shaking goodbye to us with their hats! They reach a point within a stone’s throw of the stone wall. No further.“","<br />This image is representative of Irish units throughout the Civil War. Galley’s account illustrates the iconic nature of these Irish soldiers. While marching full force into what they knew would be their last engagement, the men were smiling and laughing, with a look of passion and murder in their eye; from the perspective of American soldiers, this kind of bravery bordered on insanity.","<br />Because of the actions and attitudes like that of these Irish soldiers in battle at Fredericksburg, the opinion and attitude towards Irish immigrants changed for some Americans. While the Irish would have a long road towards equality, for those Americans who served in battle with the Irish, progress was made towards integration with those that, “try to go beyond, but are slaughtered.”<br /><br />"],"locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":958,"tag":"Irish Immigration"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}]},{"id":5219,"title":"United Textile Workers Ready to Strike","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"9/1/34","end_date":"9/1/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The textile workers had had enough. On September 1, 1934 at 11:30 p.m. they went on strike. Francis J. Gorman, Chairman of the National Special Strike Committee of the United Textile Workers of America, sent a telegraph to Alabama Governor Benjamin Miller to make him aware of the strike and the reasons behind it. Gorman reasoned that the workers themselves provided the authority for the strike and that it is a “result of abuses no longer bearable.” He listed several grievances of the textile workers and asked Governor Miller for the “protection which you are required to give all citizens.” Gorman sought protection from the “forces of employers” and, interestingly, “the insidious and disruptive forces of communism.” Gorman assured Miller that the strike will be “an orderly lawful and democratic procedure.” He concludes the telegram by requesting that the Governor ensure that they be treated fairly during the strike.","Historian Robert Ingalls discusses the plight of union workers and communist agitators in Birmingham during the 1930s. He asserts that the communists worked to provide equality between the classes and the races but were victims of the status quo. Big businesses, the employers Gorman feared, covertly promoted violence against communists in order to keep themselves in power. Ingalls writes that the communists wanted to improve workers’ rights and promote unions. Yet, in this telegram, Gorman spurned the communists. This is a unique perspective that historians have not fully studied. Ingalls acknowledges how the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People rejected any association with the communists, even as they attempted to help end racism and discrimination. However he doesn’t mention any tensions with unions. According to Ingalls, by 1934 Birmingham was “in the throes of strike fever.” He notes as labor unrest grew, so did anti-communist violence.  In fact, the crackdown caused some union spokesmen to argue that communists were being used as scapegoats to distract the public from the real cause of the strikes. Ingalls provides evidence that the communists and unions were on the same side yet this document opposes that belief. Perhaps pro-union men like Gorman simply did not like being associated with such an unfavorable group as the communists, even if they did share some beliefs. What is clear is that conditions for United Textile Workers were deplorable and they were ready to act."],"locations":[{"id":24062,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}]},{"id":5221,"title":"<strong>Soldier Resists Segregation on Birmingham Streetcar</strong>","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"6/6/23","end_date":"6/6/46","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During World War II , whites and blacks had sacrificed for their country; yet, only the whites who returned found themselves recipients of respect. Around 9:40pm on June 6, 1943 a “negro” soldier boarded a streetcar in Birmingham, Alabama on the North Birmingham Line. Instead of moving to the back of the car, he chose to stand in the white section. White passengers began to complain and the conductor told him to move back to the negro section. After some “questionable language”, the soldier refused, stating he was going to the station where his troop train was waiting.  With some coaxing, the soldier finally moved back, but not entirely out of the white section. At the next stop, a few more negroes boarded the train. The soldier threw himself across the seats stopping these men from moving to the back of the train. The conductor opened the doors and told him to get off. After a small altercation, the soldier hit the conductor and fled.","According to leading historians, this was a common experience for black soldiers returning home to Birmingham and other cities during and after the war. Although they had earned the respect of their commanders while fighting for their country, at home they were still viewed as second class citizens. Forced to face humiliation at the hands of white streetcar conductors and passengers, they resisted. Sometimes their resistance came in the form of calling others to stand with them in defiance. More often than not their calls were in vain. For too long black citizens had attempted to resist racial segregation on streetcars and failed. With time however, their demands for equality coalesced into an unstoppable force.","From the emergence of streetcar lines, the races had been at odds over sharing transportation. When attempts to provide separate cars failed, it was decided that cars would have to be shared albeit divided. On May 3, 1923, Birmingham Railway, Light, and Power Co. requisitioned its first set of racial partitions for 184 of its streetcars. In a formal gesture they were stating that there would “now” be segregated transportation. This was the case all across the country. Cities were formally segregating their streetcars in an attempt to quell violence between the races while maintaining their transportation systems. However, this system of racial separation would not fulfill its goal. Twenty years later, soldiers like this one and black civilians alike were still resisting racial segregation of streetcars."],"locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"}]},{"id":5222,"title":"Spanish Influenza Aspirin Scare","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/18","end_date":"10/31/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1918 the American Bayer aspirin manufacturer ran an advertisement in the October 18, 1918 edition of the<em> Birmingham News</em>, assuring readers that “the manufacture of Bayer-Tablets and Capsules of Aspirin is completely under American control.” They wanted to assure readers that they were “being operated as a 100% American concern” and that the overseers of that operation were all “native American.” Bayer clearly wanted readers to know their product was none other than American-made, which translated into “safe.” But what was going on that warranted this effort to convince people aspirin was safe? In the fall of 1918 a story was spreading from coast to coast: Germans, the story went, were dispensing aspirin with an insidious secret ingredient: Spanish influenza.","The aspirin story was not all that was spreading from coast to coast in 1918. Between 1918-1920, the pandemic “Spanish” flu killed around 675,000 Americans and infected millions. It was swift and severe and, at first, no one saw it coming because everyone's attention was turned to Europe and the raging war. Soon fear began to spread as well. Germans were already vilified by Americans so it made sense to them that the “Huns” might utilize biological warfare in this way. Historian Alfred Crosby relates how the head of the Health and Sanitation Section of the Emergency Fleet Corporation accused Germany of having “started epidemics in Europe” and that he saw “no reason why they should be particularly gentle with America.” Crosby reminds us “[t]he people of the United States were stark raving patriotic in summer 1918.” One way Americans showed support for the war was by virtue of boycotting all things German. The “Germanness” of beer and ale was questioned, Crosby writes, so that American breweries also felt it necessary to take out ads in newspapers defending their loyalty. A suggestion was made that Bach and Beethoven—both German composers and both dead for some time—should be banned from all concerts. Americans trusted nothing other than products made for and by Americans.","And so it was that Bayer found itself in the position of defending its formerly German-patented product. No, influenza was not spread through aspirin tablets. The illness spread far too quickly to be caused by pills. Fear, however, spread more quickly than illness, and so in October 1918 Bayer found itself trying to calm that fear. “They may be used with full confidence” the advertisement declared, during a time when confidence was in short supply."],"locations":[{"id":18257,"lat":33.553801834,"lng":-86.8960886107,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":763,"tag":"epidemic"},{"id":762,"tag":"influenza"}]},{"id":5223,"title":"Suspected Mollies Murder in Broad Daylight","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-10-17","end_date":"1877-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alexander Rea was murdered on a Saturday morning on October 23, 1868 while on his way to the coal mine where he worked. He was shot six times at close range and $500 dollars was stolen from his body. The corpse was hidden in the bushes and was not discovered until the next day. Eleven years later three suspects were arrested and tried for the crime. Patrick Hester, Peter McHugh, and Patrick Tully,   were assumed to be members of the notorious Molly Maguires, the secretive and violent Irish labor union. It was assumed that Rea, as a mine authority, had somehow crossed the Molly Maguires. Rumors spread of mine officials being targeted by the Mollies during this period. The trial brought both local and national attention.","Throughout the 1860s and 1870s there were numerous reports of mine authorities being murdered by the Molly Maguires. Historians debate the reasons behind the Molly Maguires’   violent acts.  Historian Kevin Kenny believes that the Mollies “were fighting in their own way for justice” against the indignities that Irish immigrants had to endure during this period. These indignities included Irishmen being denied work; “No Irish Need Apply” signs were common in store windows. Irishmen were also often given the most undesirable assignments within the coal mines. Although the Mollies may have started as Irishmen fighting injustices, historian Arthur Lewis believes they quickly became a violent gang who terrorized the coal mines of Pennsylvania.  In his opinion, “the Mollies degenerated into gangs of murderous thugs, they were opposed by most decent Irishmen.”","The jury at the trial, it seems, came down on Lewis’s side of the debate. The court ruling in this particular trial definitely seemed more appropriate for violent gang members than men fighting injustices. . All three men were convicted, sentenced to death, and hanged. This was the first ruling of first degree murder for that particular court. At the time the sentence brought the total of suspected Mollies on death row to fifteen men.

The conductor, claiming there was standing room in the “negro” section, told some “negro” passengers who were standing near the entrance to move back and make room for the oncoming white passengers.  In a voice of opposition, one of the black men told the conductor to tell the white men crowding the “negro” section to move up in the car. With the tensions rising, one of the white passengers took offense to the black man's comments and set about to start a fight. The conductor moved in between them, and the black man supposedly began to hit the conductor. The conductor then told the man “if you hit me [again] I will kill you.” In a surprising turn of events, the conductor seemingly calmed the enraged man, refunded his fare, and told him to get off to “avoid further trouble.”","This was only one report among hundreds written by street car conductors about “incidents” on their cars. Acts of resistance like this one were commonplace in Birmingham during the 1940s. Conductors and white passengers alike reported these incidents sometimes at the rate of 14 a month. They could be as simple as blacks refusing when asked to move out of the white section. However, occasionally they resulted in the deaths of blacks who “violently” resisted this form of racial humiliation. Occurrences of resistance continued to rise as blacks slowly began to organize their resistance to this form of racial segregation. Despite their efforts, resistance to streetcar segregation did not immediately bring about the broad civil rights changes they hoped for.","Nevertheless, historians such as Catherine Barnes have argued that these early forms of resistance to racial segregation provided the catalyst for later modes of protest against segregation. These instances of blacks refusing to move or make way for white passengers were the breeding ground for some of the biggest names in the later civil rights movement.

Communists urged miners and steel workers to fight for higher wages. The communists proclaimed to be “giving leadership to the workers and raising real demands for them.” They urged white and black workers to band together and claimed that the unity of the two races on this issue had \"been a stirring example of how workers must fight to win their demands.” The communists included on the flier a list of demands that fighting workers should endorse. They demanded that workers stay on strike until they received better pay, developed rank and file leadership by elections and insisted on equal pay between the races. At the bottom of the flier, there was an invitation to join the Communist Party, which was leading the “revolutionary struggle to build a Soviet America.”","During the 1930s, the American Civil Liberties Union listed Birmingham as one of 11 \"centers of repression,\" and anti-communist violence peaked during this period. Communists advocated for whites, blacks, the poor and even women. These were truly revolutionary ideas for the time. The communists’ drive for equality went against the status quo and elicited  considerable backlash. Historian Robert Ingalls attributes this hostile response to establishment attitudes about labor. Communist ideas ran contrary to “business as usual” and big businesses, such as the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, felt threatened by their presence. These big corporations, which essentially dominated Birmingham economically, publically condemned communists and surreptitiously helped finance violence against them. ","Robin Kelley takes a different approach to studying the effects of the Communist Party in Birmingham. According to Kelley, anti-communists played on Southern fears of racial equality to attack the communist cause. The communists did not hide their messages of equality.  It is stated clearly on their fliers. They led protests in attempts to create equal conditions for blacks and whites. In Birmingham at this time, racial equality was not a popular sentiment. Membership in the infamous Ku Klux Klan went up for the first time in over a decade. To promote equality was to be a communist and the Klan could not allow such ideals to take hold. Unfortunately, racist politicians promoted the same sentiments. Kelley argues that much of the backlash against the Communist Party was a result of their egalitarian principles. From the flier, it is clear that both conditions--establishment condemnation of radicals and racism--were at work to hold back the rise of the Communist Party. The 1930s were a bleak time in Birmingham’s history but the workers struggled and fought when they could.  This spirit is embodied by the flier that read “Now is the time to fight!”"],"locations":[{"id":24536,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}]},{"id":5227,"title":"The Irish Riot on Saint Patrick’s Day","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-17","end_date":"1867-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Four leaf clovers adorned the street corners of New York City, soft bagpipes in the background-accompanied fiddles, and the whiskey flowed forth with a seemingly endless supply.

This was what Eugene “Bull” Connor, Birmingham’s Commissioner of Public Safety during the 1940s, saw as the only option to ensure public peace. This separation of the races included the segregation of Birmingham’s streetcars. In a letter dated June 29, 1944 to Mr. C. L. Harris of Birmingham’s Merchant Association, Connor assures him of the city’s efforts to quell the rising black “violence” on Birmingham’s streetcars. He informs Mr. Harris that he had already taken the action two or three years ago to install segregation boards on street cars operating in the city. Though, he conceded that his actions had been in vain in some parts of the city.","The racial violence Connor was referring to was the rising tide of resistance to segregation on streetcars in Birmingham. On many occasions, before “his” segregation boards had gone up, blacks had fought with conductors over having to give up their seats or move to the back of cars. The Merchant Association was concerned that these acts of resistance or “violence” might cause people to shy away from the rail lines altogether. In an effort to calm the movement, Connor had signs clearly marking the racial separation put on all Birmingham streetcars. This did little to assure blacks of their right to an “equal” experience on streetcars as more often than not the signs would be moved to make room for more white passengers as the expense of black riders. Because of this and other forms of blatant inequity, blacks continued to resist segregation, sometimes violently, until Birmingham’s streetcars were shut down in 1946.","These instances of resistance to racial segregation had little impact of the contemporary attitudes about racial segregation as a whole, but nevertheless that they occurred at all was a miracle. According to historian August Meier although the failure of any racial equality movement during the 1940s was inevitable, the resistance instilled in African American communities a sense of unity that carried over to the bus boycotts that helped end segregation altogether. Despite repeated attempts, like those of Connor, to quell black resistance to the humiliation of segregation it was clear then, as it is was in the 1950s, that blacks were never going to accept a system of separate but equal that was inherently biased towards whites."],"locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}]},{"id":5230,"title":"African Americans and Southern Labor Unions","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/67","end_date":"12/31/67","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“The union wasn’t right by us,” was how James Manley summed up his experiences as an African American union member during an interview conducted by the Sloss Furnace Association. In 1984 Manley sat down in an interview with the goal of recording his thoughts on his career at Sloss Furnaces, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. Manley spoke of being laid off in 1967 for no stated reason but he surmised it was because the company was replacing older African Americans with younger whites. According to Manley the union did nothing about the layoffs. He contended this was because the unions were controlled by whites who were not interested in helping African Americans with grievances. In fact union officials often simply ripped up the grievances filed by African Americans. Manley directly experienced this practice; a union official by name of Carl Waddell ripped up one of Manley’s grievances right in front of a friend of Manley’s, who then told Manley.","These experiences were common for African Americans during the decades Manley worked for Sloss. Unions often had no interest in the concerns of African Americans. For example, according to historian Michael Honey, unions under the auspices of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) often organized African Americans into separate “Federal Units,” or excluded them from unions altogether. While the AFL’s rival, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), was officially more welcoming to African Americans, its white members often discriminated against them. Timothy Minchin contends the reason unions failed to support African Americans was because of local union autonomy. Local unions essentially ran themselves without interference from national organizations to which they belonged, which according to Minchin “ensured that there was often a gap between national unions’ nondiscrimination policies and actual racial practice in the south.” Local union autonomy meant that whites, who often had majority control, could do what they wanted with little opposition. Minchin contends that these local unions were allowed to pursue racist policies and actions because the national unions’ feared that if they pushed the race issue that whites would “quit their unions en masse.”","National unions’ fear of losing local influence by losing white support resulted in many sorts of discrimination of African Americans. Commonly this resulted in the union failing to do anything about how African Americans were overlooked for positions in favor of whites, mainly because these positions were seen as “White.” This is what happened to Manley; he bid on jobs and was overlooked in favor of whites. According to Manley, “The highest job a black could get before the Civil Rights Movement was when you got to be a helper or a fireman or a keeper on the furnace.” Manley’s testimony is an example of a union system that espoused racial equality but was crippled by national leaders who feared the loss of influence and local leaders with no incentive to challenge the system that assured their workplace privilege."],"locations":[{"id":31662,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}]},{"id":5231,"title":"Fun Times During the 1918 Spanish Flu Epidemic","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"10/21/18","end_date":"10/21/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 21,1918, <em>Birmingham News</em> staff writer Henry Vance told his readers “[i]t is much better to be interned than interred.” The Spanish influenza had reached Birmingham, and officials had advised citizens to stay inside to avoid infection. Each day Vance featured a new game idea suitable for families to play while they remained indoors. In number six of a series called “Indoor Sports For the Interned During the Influenza Epidemic” he asked his readers a question: “Ever play logomachy? There's a game for you.” Then, as with other suggestions in the series, such as parcheesi and various card games, he proceeded to explain the game and how to play it. Logomachy (pronounced: lo-ga'-ma-key), as it turns out, was a card version of what we would call Scrabble. “The main idea in Logomachy,” he explained, “is to take a deck of cards with letters on them, shuffle and deal.” He then spelled out the main idea of Logomachy: “You play your cards to the board. If your card helps spell a word it counts in your favor.” One can imagine families eagerly taking to these ideas, as there was little else for them to do in late October of 1918.","The pandemic flu had come to town, and it was quickly claiming victims. The paper was reporting deaths daily and health officials realized they must act. During that month the city of Birmingham began closing schools and canceling public gatherings. Theaters and department stores were all but abandoned. In fact, Boards of Health across the nation were canceling events. Author John Barry relates how cities were rescheduling outdoor activities such as parades and war rallies. In Philadelphia officials canceled the draft call. People were told to avoid crowds, stay inside and keep warm. This was reasonable advice. The Spanish Influenza ultimately infected one-third of the world population and killed 675,000 Americans. The only hope people had was to try and lock it out of their homes.","With businesses closed, people had little else to do to pass the time. We could presume that boredom set in quickly for families as days, and then weeks, went by without being able to go to town. However, as Vance pointed out, it was much better to be locked in than to risk dying. He advised that “all should take their enforced confinement good-naturedly during the influenza epidemic.” Deadly flu was striking every city in the nation, and Henry Vance responded with an effort to keep everyone's spirits up. “It's a great game,” he wrote, “and if I can buy a deck of cards I'm going to beat somebody yet, while this epidemic is on.”"],"locations":[{"id":18257,"lat":33.553801834,"lng":-86.8960886107,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":762,"tag":"influenza"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}]},{"id":5232,"title":"Captain O’Brien Gives Birth to Theatre in Birmingham","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The citizens of Birmingham lived without art. That was until Captain Frank O’Brien, Birmingham, Alabama’s fourteenth mayor, leased the upper floor of a small brick building in the city’s Southside in 1872. It was named Sublett’s Hall in honor of a Confederate Major from Mississippi and was the first theatre in Birmingham. Captain O’Brien is best remembered for his other contribution to the city: O’Brien’s Opera House. Like Sublett’s Hall, O’Brien’s Opera House opened in the upper floors of a brick building. However, the Opera House was built ten years later in the city’s Northside. The theatre’s opening night was a sell-out. On that night, the theatre showed <em>The Black Cook. </em>The Parisian musical had been controversial when it played in New York. Sermons were even preached against it. Opening night was eventful for another reason. The lights would not turn on. Captain O’Brien borrowed headlights from locomotives from the nearby train yard.","In 1899, a New York company, Klaw and Erlanger, leased the theatre for five years for $4000. The story attracted attention because New Yorkers were taking interest in Birmingham’s new theatre life and <em>The New York Times </em>even reported on it. O’Brien’s Opera House attracted large crowds from all parts of the young city until 1900 when the larger and more beautiful Jefferson Theatre opened a few blocks away. The Opera House would reopen in 1906 under different ownership as The Gaiety, a burlesque house. The Gaiety closed in 1912 and was demolished in 1915, but theatre was just beginning to flourish in Birmingham.","According to Don Haarbauer, theatre in Birmingham is unique in the South because the city was founded after the Civil War and therefore has few ties to the society of the “Old South.” The city never had an aristocracy devoted to the arts. Instead, artistic interests were left to the middle class. Haarbauer says that this allowed theatre to thrive in downtown for many years.

Typical influenza went after only the weakest, the young and the very old. It had even come to be known as the “old man's friend” Barry explains, for the way it took the elderly in a somewhat peaceful manner. “There was no such grace about influenza in 1918” he explains.

Parsons served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War as a private in the Washington Artillery of New Orleans. During his time of service in the war, Parsons wrote around twelve letters that he sent to his family in Talladega, Alabama. Parsons tried to write a letter every chance he had some free time to himself. He specifically states in a May 28 letter “I write whenever I get a chance.” Parsons would write a letter every time he came in from the battle field. He also told his family “you don’t know how it relieves my mind to have a letter on the way home.” This one letter that he writes certainly shows how homesick he had become. He says “you all may miss me a great deal but not as much as I miss you.” This specific letter that Parsons writes gives a good description of how much he missed his family, and this could be said for many other soldiers of the Civil War. Many other soldiers felt the same way that Parsons did about missing his family, and these letters were taken very serious by everyone involved.","Writing to family members was very important to the soldiers of the Civil War. These men probably would not have been able to stay sane for very long if it was not for the letters that they got to write to their family members and also the letters that the families sent back to the soldiers. James Pate gives a historical account of some brothers in the Civil War that also wrote letters back and forth to their family. Pate comments on how the brothers “directed most of their letters to family members.” This family took these letters very seriously, and they made every effort to keep the letters going to each other during the war. It was so important to them that “each family member became a wartime correspondent.” The letters of this family and the importance of writing to each other show that Lewis Parsons was not alone when it came to writing to family members and being homesick.","The letters of soldiers during the war also became very important to the communities as well. The Parsons letters could have been read by the citizens of the town that he was from and not just his family members. Some solders’ letters got sent around to everyone in the town so that the people could know how the war was going or how their friend was doing. In his book, <em>Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama,</em> Walter Fleming says that “letters from the army gave news of the men of the settlement who were in the writer’s company or regiment, and when received were read to the neighbors or sent around the community.” Parsons’ letters might not have been read by the community or the neighbors, but he definitely sent them to his family.

The heroes of the piece were wealthy mine owner Frankilin B. Gowen and Pinkerton detective James McCparland both according to Mclure were instrumental in toppling the Molly Maguires . The Mollies in contrast were depicted by McClures as villains who “killed men and women with whom they had no dealings, against whom they had no personal grievances, and from whose death they had nothing to gain, except, perhaps, the price of a few rounds of whiskey”.","According Moffet, in 1873 Franklin B. Gowen, President of the Reading Railroad, was fed up with the Molly Maguires. The Molly Maguires had been terrorizing the coal mines owned by Gowen and killing many officials who ran the mines. To finally rid himself of the Mollies Gowen enlisted the help of the Pinkerton detectives. Allen Pinkerton, head of the detectives, assigned James McParland to Mollie case. Pinkerton ordered McParland “to remain in the field until every cut-throat has paid with his life for the lives taken”.  A few weeks later McParland assumed the cover name McKenna and entered bar frequented by Mollies. In the bar McParland was accused of cheating in a card game and as a result found himself in a fight with a large Mollie named Frazier. McParland knocked out the much larger Frazier and became an instant sensation among Mollies, making it much easier for him to infiltrate the group. Soon McParland was inducted as a full fledged member of the Mollies and even became a secretary of the Shenandoah division. Afterwards McParland began traveling throughout the divisions of secret labor union, all the while gathering evidence Maguires against the Mollies.","Moffett’s sensationalized story on  Gowen and McPardland’s victory over the evil Molly Maguires is an interesting look into public opinion of the Mollies during that time; however many modern historians believe the situation was more complicated.  Historian Wayne Broehl, for example, asserts that Gowen conjured up the specter of the Molly in Pennsylvania to demonize labor unions. Broehl claims that Gowen was having problems with the labor union within his mines and after being unable to subdue the union “decided to break the struggling labor organization by painting it with the brush of Molly Maguireism.” Broehl’s argument does not seem implausible, but it does not explain the murdered mine officials. In any case Gowen’s idea of sending a man inside the Molly Maguires was successful.","McParland spent two and a half years under cover before there was sufficient evidence to bring down the Mollies.

In 1984 Gaines sat down in an interview with the Sloss Furnace Association with the goal of recording his thoughts on his career at Sloss Furnaces, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. In the course of his interview he recounted his own personal experiences with this workplace segregation. According to Gaines while he was employed at the concrete plant he had been instructed to operate a machine called the compressor when it usual operator, a man by the name of McDonald, was off work. Eventually the position of compressor operator became open and interested workers began applying for the position, or as they called it, biding on the job. Gaines too applied as he had already been operating the compressor for some time but when he approached the superintendent, a man by the name of Lawson, he was summarily denied the position in favor a white applicant. Superintendent Lawson informed Gaines frankly, “You can run it just as good as McCan, but you ain't gonna get it.\"","The “Color Line” that Gaines had encountered served as a barrier to African American workplace advancement in the south for decades. The south had developed strict delineations between what were considered “white” and “black” positions. According to historian William A. Sundstrom the color line segregated African Americans and whites, “along lines of skill levels, supervisory responsibilities, and manual versus white-collar tasks,” in many industries. It was implicitly understood and, as Gaines testimony shows, sometime explicitly stated that an African American worker would not have a supervisory position over a white worker. This is exactly what happened to Gaines when he applied for the compressor operator position; despite having the necessary skills to operate the machine he was told upfront that he would never get the position. That position was considered a “white job” and Gaines was denied the opportunity simply because of an ingrained prejudice that placed some positions at a higher social status that would then denied to those who were considered lower in social rank, even inspite of their proven capacity to perform the work required of that position."],"locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}]},{"id":5236,"title":"Turncoat at the Mollie Trials","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-09-03","end_date":"1876-03-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1876 the New York Times published an article describing the murder trial of John P. Jones , a mine boss of the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company. It was widely believed that Jones murderers were members of the secretive and violent Irish labor union called the Molly Maguires. During this time stories of the Mollies murdering mine bosses that crossed the group were very common.","A very interesting point the article made is that the prosecution actually had a witness that was close to the Mollies. James Kerrigan, a former member of the Mollies, was the prosecution’s star witness in the case. This was an anomaly because the Molly Maguires were such a secretive group, even its supposed own members did not acknowledge that the labor union existed. So the prosecution finding someone who was associated with the Mollies that was willing to testify against them was extremely powerful evidence. Kerrigan’s testimony implicated three alleged Mollies in the murders of Jones and a policeman named Yost.","Throughout the 1860s and 1870s Molly Maguires dominated the coal mines of Pennsylvania. It was difficult for authorities to stop the organization because there was very little evidence of the Mollies crimes or that they even existed. Kerrigan, an admitted member of the Mollies, testifying against other members was largely damaging to the organization. Historian Arthur Lewis describes Kerrigan as unremorseful while he testified against his former brethren. According to Lewis Kerrigan “ answered all questions cheerfully… and after seven hours on the stand, retired to his seat with the modest air of a good man who has just performed a citizen’s duty for which he expects no reward.”","According to the article Kerrigan’s testimony was hugely important.

Because he said something was safe didn’t mean it was safe.” This is how Ulysses S. Anderson described the safety conditions at Sloss Furnace, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. While being interviewed by the Sloss Furnace Association Anderson spent a great amount of time describing the safety conditions he encountered during his employment at Sloss. As the previous quote demonstrates, the safety standards at Sloss were not always up to par. Anderson describes several incidents wherein he was almost injured or killed. Two of these incidents stand out as examples of the safety conditions at Sloss and the dangers that workers in steel mills routinely faced. In the first incident Anderson accidently stepped into a hole and as he pulled his foot out hole it was badly burned by the hot iron. He described the injury saying that his foot had been burned, “from the arch all the way down.” Anderson had to have skin removed from his leg so that it could be grafted to his foot. In the second incident Anderson was almost killed by poisonous gases escaping from the furnace. According to his testimony he was working on cleaning the coal from the furnace when he suddenly became aware of a severe pain in his head and it was then that he noticed two men lying unconscious on the floor. When a co-worker by the name of Mr. Seabury noticed Anderson and the two unconscious men he immediately set off the alarm and got the three men out of the area. Luckily Anderson and the two other men managed to survive the incident. According to Anderson no one had ever bothered to warn him about the potential hazard of gases escaping from the furnace.","Unfortunately hazards like those faced by Anderson were all too common in the furnaces and mills of the era. According to historian John A. Fitch, “every workingman in an iron or steel mill is in danger because he is working with forces which are, seemingly, always watching for a chance to get beyond human control.” The number of deaths from accidents in furnaces and mills could be simply astounding. According to Fitch’s study of steel mills in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania there were 195 deaths in single year from workplace accidents in iron and steel mills. These sorts of accidents were often caused by lack of safety provisions built into the machines and equipment utilized in the furnace or mill. Fitch provides an account that serves to illustrate this point. In one mill he visited there was heavy machinery with exposed gearing that was, “absolutely unguarded, although it was common knowledge that workmen had been caught in just such places and badly injured.”","Despite the fact that simple safety precautions and common sense could have lessened the danger workers faced, they were placed in extremely dangerous situations could that result in dire consequences. If an accident did occur it was likely that those involved would die horrible and painful deaths, and even if they survived they were often permanently scarred and kept from working. This is exactly what happened to Anderson when his foot was badly burned; he was forced to endure a skin graft and then spend six to eight weeks off the job while he recuperated."],"locations":[{"id":28563,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":964,"tag":"Industrial Safety Conditi"}]},{"id":5238,"title":"The South's Exciting First Victory","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-17","end_date":"1861-04-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The newspaper article \"Glory Enough for One Day\" was written on April 17, 1861.

It also says that \"there was no longer a foot of territory in the state of South Carolina in possession of a government foreign to her soil and its interests.\"","            The article has a very arrogant sound to it at the start of the next paragraph when the author mentions that there would be other victories \"equally as decisive, until the government of the North shall be compelled to recognize our independence.\" There should be a feeling like this from southern people because the South did not lose one man in the battle, which took \"over thirty hours.\" The article also gives this impression when it explains that the Confederate States \"have given the Abolition power an earnest of what it may expect in the future. As is the beginning, so will be the end.\" This ending to the article definitely gives a feeling that the South thought they would win the war with ease.","            The battle at Fort Sumter was the start of the Civil War. The shots fired by the Confederates at the fort were the first shots fired in the war. History was completely changed on the day that Anderson surrendered Fort Sumter to the Confederates. Bruce Catton writes in his book <em>The Civil War</em> that \"the bombardment of Fort Sumter was the visible symbol that the war had begun.\" Catton notes that \"Lincoln and Davis had already made up their minds to fight rather than to yield.\" Jefferson Davis did not feel like waiting any longer for the Union to attack first. He was tired of the “peace” and the people of the South were also tired of waiting. David Detzer comments in his book, <em>Allegiance: Fort Sumter, Charleston, and the Beginning of the Civil War,</em> that “peace is always conditional.” Davis was tired of depending on the North to fire shots first. Detzer also states that “wars begin when people consider that the state of peace that exists is no longer acceptable, that war would relieve their problems.” This fatigue of the peaceful status quo could be why the newspaper article sounded so excited about the first battle of the war taking place, and the fact that the fort was surrendered to the Confederacy.  "],"locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"}]},{"id":5239,"title":"A Soldier Gets Sick","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-17","end_date":"1864-05-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lewis E. Parsons wrote many letters during the Civil War to his family in Talladega, Alabama. Parsons talks about many different things in his letters to home. He mainly asks questions about the home front, and he also talks a great deal about how war is an awful thing. He describes many different situations that he and his fellow men have to go through during the time of war. One of the situations or problems that these soldiers had to face was being sick or getting a disease. Sickness was a very serious problem that many soldiers had to deal with while they were off at war. Parsons does not talk very much about sickness or disease, but he does make one reference to sickness in a letter that he wrote on May 17. He says “I am still having chills and am very weak.” Many soldiers had these same symptoms or feelings that Parsons had. These chills that Parsons takes note of could probably be the symptoms of typhoid fever. The men in the camps started calling the sickness “camp fever”. Many soldiers got sick during the war because of the camps that they had to stay in all the time.","            The camps were very unsanitary, and disease was all around the men because of these unsanitary conditions. Historian Thomas Cutrer wrote about some letters from a Confederate soldier to his wife. The soldier’s name was William Moxley, and he served in the Eighteenth Alabama Infantry during the war. Cutrer tells of how Moxley wrote a lot about the sickness of the soldiers and diseases that they had. The soldiers “never acquired the immunities necessary to fight off even the most common of childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and scarlet fever.” So when the soldiers had to leave their homes to go live in these unsanitary camps they contracted many different diseases. Cutrer also says that a “great interest and value in the Moxley letters is their wealth of commentary concerning the epidemics of disease that shattered both Southern armies and Southern home communities.” These diseases wiped out a huge percentage of both armies during the war. The main disease that was “especially deadly was typhoid.” There were many other diseases and infections that went through these soldiers, but typhoid fever killed the most number of men.","            Another historian by the name of James Pate writes about the letters of the Francis brothers who were soldiers in the Civil War. Pate says that “health issues were a major subject, and outbreaks of measles, mumps, and typhoid fever were routinely reported.” So, Lewis Parsons was not the only soldier sitting in his camp with chills and a feeling of weakness. Every other soldier in that same camp with Parsons probably had some type of sickness or disease. Parsons probably had one of the diseases mentioned above. He did not say in his letter how bad he was feeling, but the sentence he writes does let the reader know that Parsons was sick or on the verge of getting sick. It could have been one of the deadly diseases that were rampaging through both armies."],"locations":[{"id":13598,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}]}]}
