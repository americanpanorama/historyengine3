The majority of these slaves identified as Gullah and Geechee people. As Southerners left the islands to escape the occupation, slaves had the opportunity to buy land from their former owners. The Gullah and Geechee people who bought this land kept their African heritage alive. "," ","Gullah and Geechee refers to two different groups of African Americans; Geechee refers to those who are from the Georgia sea islands and Gullah refers to those who are from the South Carolina sea islands. The Gullah and Geechee people were and still are isolated from mainland culture. The Gullah and Geechee people live collectively on the same property. Since they like to have minimal ties to the outside world, they grow their own crops and cook traditional meals. Furthermore, they honor their ancestors that worked on the very plantations where they currently live, by speaking in their unique dialect and practicing rituals that date back hundreds of years."," ","The result of the newly freed slaves created an extraordinary culture that is unique to the sea islands of the Lowcountry and has withstood nearly six generations. Although the people are still  present on the islands today, their property is under legal fire. The turn of the 20th century brought about discomfort for the Gullah and Geechee. Resort towns began to pop up around the islands of Cumberland, Jeckyll, Ossabaw, Sapelo, and St. Simons became reservations and popular tourist destinations. Today, resort towns, like Hilton Head Island, are quickly developing near Gullah property. Even more troubling, the Gullah people have heirs property, meaning property was passed down through verbal will without legal documentation. Because of this, real-estate moguls are finding loop holes to obtain the coveted property. "," ","The Gullah and Geechee people have seen trials throughout their entire existence. From being enslaved to being newly freed, they had to confront the adversity of mainland culture and are currently in legal and communal battles over their heirs property on the sea islands of Georgia and South Carolina. "," "," "],"locations":[{"id":52942,"lat":32.3790843,"lng":-80.6926069,"zoom":5,"place":"port royal, sc"},{"id":52943,"lat":32.216316,"lng":-80.752608,"zoom":4,"place":"hilton head island"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2978,"tag":"Confederate"},{"id":1609,"tag":"georgia"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":3065,"tag":"gullah"},{"id":3066,"tag":"geechee"},{"id":3067,"tag":"port royal experiment"},{"id":3068,"tag":"sea islands"}]},{"id":6556,"title":"Widows and Daughters of the South","course_id":160,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-12","end_date":"1865-05-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["While their husbands were away at war, the women of the South had to leave behind their lives of comfort to assume roles to benefit the Confederate war effort. Many wives whose husbands and sons went to battle were left without a breadwinner and funds. Although Jefferson Davis’s wife, Varina, was not a widow at the time of his imprisonment, she faced similar challenges of widows. "," ","Women and daughters of the South whose husbands and fathers were off at battle were faced with the challenge of helping the war effort from the comfort of their homes. The women of Savannah helped the Confederacy by holding local fairs where they sold their valuable jewelry and china to collect funds to buy supplies for the soldiers and hospitals. They also donated their expensive piano covers to aid as blankets for the soldiers. In addition, the women created “The Ladies’ Gunboat Association” to collect donations to fund a warship to protect Coastal Georgia. They also created wayside homes which provided food and shelter for soldiers who were in need. "," ","Varina Davis played a significant role in her family as well. While her husband Jefferson Davis was imprisoned, she had to assume the position of head of the household. Despite the fact that her husband was alive, she faced similar troubles that widows of Confederacy had also. Although many widows depended on their inheritance to survive, Varina had nothing. She had to find a place and means to live, find a way to educate her six children, and figure out what her new life would entail. When Jefferson was freed, he was offered a job as a university president, but that offered little money to support the family. Jefferson and Varina spent years traveling from Canada to Cuba in search of a new life, since the Reconstruction of the South proved unwelcoming. They eventually made their way to Europe, where Varina essentially was the head of the house sense Jefferson was trying to find a job with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the United States. Jefferson obtained the job and left for Memphis, Tennessee, leaving Varina and his children in England. "," "," ","Although women on the home front were not in battle, they were metaphorical soldiers. Women had to overcome the battles of finding means to live for their family, which was difficult sense they never were the source of income for their household. Women also had to make personal sacrifices for soldiers and the Confederacy. "],"locations":[{"id":52944,"lat":32.0895435,"lng":-81.1230514,"zoom":6,"place":"Savannah, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":132,"tag":"Jefferson Davis"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":3062,"tag":"Varina Davis"},{"id":3063,"tag":"Widow"},{"id":3064,"tag":"Savannah"}]}]}
