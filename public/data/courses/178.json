As Bleier carried the last dead body out of the area, a machine gun opened fire and every soldier dropped and held their position until the firing ceased. The companies set up camp there overnight and when Company D arrived to help with the remaining bodies the next day, the enemy machine gun again opened fire upon the soldiers. Bleier’s responsibility was to provide cover fire on the machine gun so his troops could continue to move. “When I rolled over to get a grenade,” he recalled, “I heard the medic behind me hollering ‘Rock! Rock!’ As I turned around, I felt a punch in my leg and it started spurting blood.” Bleier and the medic relocated their company and got into position. By that time, the enemy had gotten close enough to drop grenades on them one of which exploded on Bleier’s right foot. A nearby soldier carried Rocky Bleier to safety and he was sent to the field hospital, ending his combat career.","            Rocky Bleier played college football at Notre Dame University from 1964 until 1968, and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers as a running back in the sixteenth round in 1968. Bleier knew that there was a chance that he could not only be drafted to professional football, but into the military too. Professional teams usually made that possibility very small. The Steelers managers, however, failed to protect Bleier from the draft and he became one of the hundreds of America’s professional athletes to participate in the Vietnam War. Bleier’s military career turned out to be quite short as he joined in December 1968 and was wounded in August 1969. His heroic services won him the Purple Heart, the bronze star, and many other campaign ribbons.","            Rocky Bleier’s football career after the war looked very much in doubt. The doctors in Tokyo told him that he would never again play professional football. After spending two seasons training and trying to make it back to the starting roster, Bleier completed the seemingly impossible returning to the Steelers lineup. Bleier and the Pittsburgh Steelers went on to win four Super Bowls between 1971 and 1980 when he finally retired. Bleier earned induction to the Professional Football Hall of Fame in 2015. His toughness and determination allowed him to overcome adversity in war and in athletics."],"locations":[{"id":53106,"lat":15.5638825,"lng":108.4786313,"zoom":8,"place":"Tam Ky, Vietnam"}],"tags":[{"id":264,"tag":"football"},{"id":3480,"tag":"Heroism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}]},{"id":6774,"title":"Supreme Court Orders the Desegregation of Prince Edward County Schools","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"1/6/64","end_date":"1/6/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 6, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that public schools in Prince Edward County, Virginia must integrate.  This decision came in the case <em>Griffin V. School Board of Prince Edward County</em> where Reverend L. Francis Griffin sued the school board for closing all public schools in the area so they would not have to integrate.  Instead, white students attended private school or school in another county while black students did not get to go to school at all from 1959 until 1964 effecting approximately 3,300 students. ","Most southern county governments opposed integration, but none like Prince Edward County.  When the <em>Brown V. Board of Education </em>(1954) decision was handed down, Virginia state and local officials declared a “massive resistance” to the law. Prince Edward County decided to defund public schools, causing them to close in order to forestay integration.  In 1961 plaintiffs challenged this closing in <em>Allen v. County School Board of Prince Edward </em>where it was argued that the closing of Prince Edward County public schools was a form of racial discrimination.  The court ruled in favor of Allen citing it is a form of discrimination and the county was expected to reopen schools to all pupils regardless of race.  However, Prince Edward County kept the schools closed for two more years in spite of this ruling leaving many black students without any formal education.  In the publication “<em>Their Voices, Our History: Stories of Prince Edward County Virginia</em>”; Everett Berryman, Jr. who was twelve at the time public schools closed, explained that he attended a grassroots training center run by his mother instead of public school.  He did not know that he was missing out on anything until his cousin from Baltimore proved much more proficient in reading and math than Everett.  To get a good education, Everett was forced to move in with a family friend so that he could attend school in nearby Appomattox County. ","In 1963, the NAACP and other civil rights groups created privately- funded free schools open to all students on an integrated basis.  In March of 1964, lawyers argued <em>Griffin v. School Board of Prince Edward County </em>in the Supreme Court.  The court ruled in favor of Griffin in a six-to-two decision.  The majority opinion, written by Justice Hugo Black, asserted that the School Board of Prince Edward Counted had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying equal protection or opportunity. They also held the school board in contempt of the <em>Brown v. Board of Education </em>(1955), which ordered it was “ necessary and proper to admit (complainants) to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed.” The court also asserted that even though local government control led public education, they could not close public schools because citizens have a right to free accessible education.","In 1964, an estimated 1,500 students returned to public schools in Prince Edward County. This event marked the end of massive resistance in Virginia. "],"locations":[{"id":53117,"lat":37.1982888,"lng":-78.4297187,"zoom":8,"place":"Prince Edward County, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1795,"tag":"integration"},{"id":1071,"tag":"Civil Rights Movement"}]},{"id":6776,"title":"Americans Shocked by Television Movie The Day After.","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"11/20/83","end_date":"11/20/83","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Day After,</em> a made-for-television movie directed by Nicholas Meyer and written by Edward Hume, aired November 20, 1983, on the ABC Television Network. The film dramatized the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The movie took place in Kansas City, Missouri and included cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. <em>The Day After</em> explored the effects of nuclear war from the perspective of ordinary Americans. The story focuses on several sets of characters: most notably Russell Oakes (played by Jason Robards), a doctor and professor at the University of Kansas, the Dahlbergs, a farming family from Harrisonville, Missouri and Billy McCoy (played by William Allen Young), an Air Force reservist stationed at Whiteman Air Base. The film became infamous at the time for scenes of violence and the graphic portrayal of characters perishing from radiation sickness. The movie ends with the ominous warning that “the catastrophic events you have just witnessed, are in all likelihood less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States…” <em>The Day After</em> attracted 100 million viewers, and remains the highest rated television movie in U.S. history.","The controversy surrounding the movie’s release caused an uproar among the American population. Americans criticized U.S. nuclear policy because of what they had seen in the film. ABC and the White House received hundreds of calls from anxious viewers, many of whom supported the movie’s message. Anti-nuclear activists rallied behind movements such as “Let Lawrence Live” and 800-NUCLEAR. Those in favor of nuclear deterrence, however, worried that the emotional fall-out of the movie and controversy surrounding it would negate any critical analysis of nuclear weapons. Director Nicholas Meyer stood firmly on the side of the anti-nuclear activists, denouncing ABC’s attempts to tone down the movie’s political nature. According to historian Deron Overpeck, Meyer wanted to “clobber sixty-million people over the head” with his criticisms of nuclear weapons.","The role <em>The Day After</em> played in changing U.S. nuclear policy is debatable. When the movie premiered in 1983, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were at their worst levels in twenty years. President Ronald Reagan viewed it days before its premier on ABC. While the movie left Reagan shaken and disheartened, he continued to defend nuclear deterrence as a means to pressure the Soviet Union to the negotiating table. Despite this, <em>The Day After</em> spurred public conversation about nuclear war to reach levels unseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis twenty-one years earlier. The movie’s greatest impact was not changing the minds of policy makers, but its effect on how ordinary Americans debated nuclear policy."],"locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.7804872,"lng":-73.9679741,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1041,"tag":"Film"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"},{"id":3507,"tag":"ABC"},{"id":3508,"tag":"Anti-Nuclear Activism"},{"id":3509,"tag":"Movie"},{"id":3510,"tag":"Nuclear War"}]},{"id":6777,"title":"Music Entrepreneurs Organize the Woodstock Festival","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"8/15/69","end_date":"8/18/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Four businessmen: Artie Kornfield, Michael Lang, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman, were determined to produce a flourishing enterprise focused on music in New York State. The four attempted to rent land close to the town of Woodstock in hopes of establishing a location for their concert. ","However, to many local citizens the musical scene of the late 1960s was controversial in the wake of anti-war protests, the emergence of the counter-culture and the involvement of drugs in the lives of performers and listeners. The council of Woodstock feared a large festival and its attendees would bring unnecessary harm to their lives and community through drugs and degradation of culture. In turn, the council passed a number of health and safety laws that prevented the four men from starting their show. The organizer’s troubles persisted as they traveled to different locations in New York looking for some place that would be open to holding their concert. ","Bethel, New York became a reluctant host to the Woodstock Festival after controversy with the town board arose in July 1969 when uncertainty arose regarding the approval of the businessmen’s’ contracts for land rent. Further opposition by citizens followed in August when some locals demanded the concert be cancelled, fearing for the health and safety of their community. These protests proved futile as the Woodstock Festival officially began on August 15, and a crowd totaling 750,000 people attended over the course of three days. Numerous musical artists representing many of the most highly regarded acts of the times, such as Santana, Janis Joplin and Creedence Clearwater Revival, traveled to the village to perform.","Without enough rooms to sufficiently house visitors, the attendees camped in public spaces, used cattle ponds for bathing, and spread litter through the community. They carried out their uninhibited lifestyle, described by social scientist Paul E. Willis as “a certain mystique, an inner logic that did not lend itself to the casual observer, or enthusiastic imitation.” Residents of Bethel began to provide the attendees with resources such as food and blankets as their guests repaid them by helping out in the community. ","The community board of Bethel, once opposed to the Woodstock Festival, were now enjoying the economic boom brought to their town, though they did not appreciate the large amount of drug use that surrounded their locale. Some community leaders believed that the youths gathering together was a blow to social morality with their public nudity and drug use.  Though the concert ended with three deaths and 5,000 reported cases of injuries and sickness, there were no reports of violence or fighting over the three days of festivities. In response to the outcome of he and his partners’ financial excursion, Michael Lang stated, “Today is a time to think about what happened here… The peace they were screaming about is what they really want – they’re living it.”"," "],"locations":[{"id":53118,"lat":41.6837659,"lng":-74.8719284,"zoom":8,"place":"Bethel, New York, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":471,"tag":"music"},{"id":2199,"tag":"Drugs"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"}]},{"id":6778,"title":"MASH Doctor Performs Emergency Medicine From the Book","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"6/25/50","end_date":"7/27/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Hermes Grillo had just arrived on his first assignment to a MASH unit during his tour in Korea.  He served in a medical unit with the 1st Marine Division and the Fleet Marine Force. Once the doctor had to operate by the book, which means directly from a book.  He recalled, “I had taken one medical book to Korea with me…I remember opening it to whatever page it was, which showed the hilum of the lung, and I propped it up on an ammunition case.” Dr. Grillo described the circumstances further, “…of course, the first thing I encountered was a massive outpouring of blood from the hilum of the lung.” He then proceeded to simultaneously read from the book and perform the operation. The Interviewer then asked “So you, in essence, were operating by the book.” “By the book,” Responded Dr. Grillo.","During the Korean Conflict (1950-1953) the United States fought alongside South Korean and United Nations troops seeking to oust communist North Korean and Chinese forces.  As an innovation based on lessons from World War II, the U.S. instituted MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hosptial) units that moved medical personnel as close to the front lines as possible, and also brought women closer to the front lines than ever before.  The goal was to help improve the survival rate of casualties.  If a soldier got to the surgeon quickly enough he had a quite good chance of survival. According to medical surgeon Dr. Grillo “… very few of them died… the worst wounds never make it; they’re dead. And then a lot of others die in transport.”  Still, to be able to save almost all your patients is an impressive feat. During 1951, MASH 8076 treated 21,143 patients and of those patients only 188 succumbed to injuries or illness. This means that only 0.889% of their patients died in 1951.","MASH units played the role of unsung hero of the war at least until the feature film and highly successful television show made Americans much more aware of their history. In World War II there were no MASH units and each soldier had a 1 in 56 chance that he was going to die. When you look towards the Korean War the soldier had a 1 in 171 chance of dying. That is a dramatic difference and a huge number of young men who did not need to die."," ","The doctors of the Korean War did everything they could to keep the soldiers that came into their care alive. Thanks to them and the system that was set up they were able to keep more people alive than in any previous war.

The strategically titled article “Life-Saving Aerial Spray Missions in Vietnam” appeared in the March 1969 issue and provided the audience with broad understanding of how defoliation missions took place. More than that, the tone, title and content of the piece explained and endorsed the necessity of such missions. In favor of herbicide and defoliant use, the article relied upon education to inform those reading the article of how vital the use of defoliants can be to American lives as “Their task: aerial defoliation at various strategic areas to help save the lives of their fighting compatriots.”","            Misunderstood and misjudged at the time, the use of defoliants in the Vietnam war, through Operation Ranch Hand, unleashed unintended environmental and health effects on those in targeted areas. Ultimately, the U.S. used eleven million gallons of defoliants leading to unimaginable destruction. The defoliants remained hidden in the soils, water systems, and fats of humans and animals following exposure and as a result, defoliants affected areas such as rice fields and rubber plantations that had not been intended targets. With dioxin levels at estimated concentrations of 1000 mg/kg in highly exposed areas, some zones in Vietnam are still considered harmful to humans. One study, published in 1998, that surveyed areas adjacent to the former A So airbase in Central Vietnam suggested that fish still contained concentrations of dioxins that would be harmful to humans if consumed. This further raises the question of whether defoliant use was necessary.","The monthly magazine held a distinguished position as the foremost provider of valuable herbicidal and agricultural information covering developments in farming techniques. With such a title came the responsibility of producing pertinent and informative articles each month. Through their report on the use of defoliants in Vietnam, <em>Weeds Trees and Turf</em> suggested to their audience of dealers and manufacturers of herbicides, along with farmers and landscapers that the topics they cover are cutting-edge and significant at that time throughout the world.","As with many new technologies, the use of defoliants in Vietnam came with an initial lack of knowledge and understanding of its long-term consequences. This use led to the significant destruction of native Vietnamese vegetation, along with severely affecting human health through cancer and birth defects, prompting an international questioning of its use and accusations of violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol. However, the article provides an example of defoliants viewed as an asset because it was critical to saving the lives of American soldiers."],"locations":[{"id":53121,"lat":41.49932,"lng":-81.6943605,"zoom":8,"place":"Cleveland, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":292,"tag":"Vietnam"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":3512,"tag":"Defoliants"},{"id":3513,"tag":"Agent Orange"},{"id":3514,"tag":"Operation Ranch Hand"}]}]}
