Carrigan and Clive Webb, reiterated “the most systematic abuse of legal authority was by the Texas Rangers.” ","Since their inception during the Texas Revolution, the Rangers protected the border region in South Texas as sole watchmen.  The philosophy in Anglo superiority justified the Rangers’ cruelty upon a race of human beings they believed to be subordinate to their own.  As the journalist following the Texas Rangers in Cuevitas, Texas, conveyed, the Texas Rangers and the Anglo population of South Texas, believed “only by the exercise of extreme measure that the ignorant and easily aroused lower class of Mexicans be brought under subjection and peace restore.”  This idea of justice “became so far beyond the bounds of civilized warfare” that General Frederick Funston, Commander of the U.S. military maneuvers along the border, had to intervene."],"display_date":"September 1915","search_date":"1915-09-15","locations":[{"id":17325,"lat":26.5829196245,"lng":-98.1225261344,"zoom":8,"place":"Hidalgo, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1042,"tag":"Mexican-American"},{"id":1045,"tag":"Texas Rangers"},{"id":1046,"tag":"Treaty Guadalupe Hidalgo"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"},{"id":1047,"tag":"Protocol of Queretaro"},{"id":1048,"tag":"Borderlands"},{"id":1050,"tag":"General Frederick Funston"},{"id":1052,"tag":"Texas-Mexico border"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5297,"title":"Neither Black nor White","course_id":73,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-05-01","end_date":"1897-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In May of 1896, Ricardo Rodriguez entered a federal court in San Antonio, Texas, and initiated his application for citizenship of the United States thereby requesting the right to vote.  Since Texas declared its independence from Mexico and was annexed into the United States, Tejanos did not qualify for American citizenship because due to “an 1872 federal statute that ruled that only Caucasians and Africans could become U.S. Citizens,” Texas did not consider Tejanos part of either race.  Yet, this statute “did not specifically deny Mexicans that right” either.  This case brought naturalization of Mexican Tejanos and their right to vote to the forefront of Texas politics.","According to the Texas State Historical Association, in the year that followed, legal maneuvers by politicians to “disenfranchise all Texas Mexicans” were at an all-time high.    San Antonio politicians, T.J. McMinn and Jack Evans, joined forces to oppose the naturalization process of Ricardo Rodriguez claiming he was “’not capable of becoming an American citizen’” due to his race.  These tactics were proclaimed throughout Texas in order to garner support for their opposition to Tejanos’ eligibility of citizenship and to discourage other Tejanos from applying.","After a year of legal maneuvers, on May 3, 1897, Judge Thomas S. Maxey ruled in favor of Ricardo Rodriguez, bestowing the right of citizenship and “thereby legally affirming the civil rights of Texas Mexicans to vote.”  In his ruling, he pointed directly at three distinct documents: The Constitution of the Republic of Texas, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.","Under the Constitution of the Republic of Texas Maxey recognized the granting of citizenship upon Mexicans living within Texas on Independence Day.  To further this reasoning Maxey directed his findings to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, specifically to Article VIII, that states Mexicans who “prefer to remain the said territories may either retain the title and rights of Mexican citizens, or acquire those of citizens o f the United States” under the agreement that the decision must be made within “one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications of this treaty.”  The treaty goes as far as stating that those who do not make their decisions voluntarily after the deadline “shall be considered to have elected to become citizens of the United States.”  Ultimately, Maxey revealed that it was the Fourteenth Amendment that “granted citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the United States, regardless of color or race.”","Through this landmark civil rights case, Judge Thomas Maxey’s confirmed that neither race nor special levels of education could be used to deny U.S. citizenship to anyone.  The argument that Mexican Tejanos were not eligible to vote because they are not white or black could no longer be used to alienate them from becoming citizens.  According to Zaragosa Vargas, a Mexican American historian, in essence, the decision confirmed the “legal right of Mexicans as ‘white,’ further cementing their right to vote."],"display_date":"May 1, 1896 - May 3, 1897","search_date":"1896-10-31","locations":[{"id":12547,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"BEXAR, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1042,"tag":"Mexican-American"},{"id":1046,"tag":"Treaty Guadalupe Hidalgo"},{"id":1052,"tag":"Texas-Mexico border"},{"id":1048,"tag":"Borderlands"},{"id":1059,"tag":"Tejanos"},{"id":1060,"tag":"Texas Independance"},{"id":1061,"tag":"Judge Thomas S.

Roosevelt instituted the New Deal for Americans.  Unfortunately, it was allocated inconsistently by local officials and resulted in the underrepresentation of Mexican-Americans.  Zaragosa Vargas, a Mexican-American historian, notes that since they held no political influence, like African-Americans, they received less benefits than whites under programs such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act,  the National Recovery Administration, the Workers Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps.","According to Vargas, San Antonio’s Westside held almost two-thirds of the Mexican-American’s total population estimated to be one hundred thousand.  The Westside slum was a breeding ground for tuberculosis, diphtheria and other communicable diseases.  It became a place of “considerable human suffering” with no alleviation in sight.","Yet, in 1932, living amidst the terrible suffering in San Antonio’s slums, Emma Tenayuca became actively involved in bringing an end to disenfranchisement, poverty and the oppression of the Mexican-American people.  In 1933, she participated and was arrested in the strike against the Finck Cigar Company.  Undaunted, she assisted and organized the garment worker’s strike against the Dorothy Frock’s Company a year later.  Her unrelenting determination led her to take important positions as leader of the Unemployed Council in 1935.  More notably, Tenyauca was recognized in 1937, when “she was elected to the National executive Committee of the Worker’s Alliance of America” as the first Mexican-American woman to ever hold that office in any national organization.","Determined, Emma Tenayuca continued to organize the Mexican-American people, hold “street meetings, [organize] mass demonstrations, [picket] relief offices, and [petition] relief offices to raise WPA work relief pay of Tejanos equal to that of Anglos.”  Vargas believed that “her fiery eloquence attracted large crowds to the open-air meetings” and made her the most successful public speaker of the time.  Due primarily to her efforts, San Antonio’s River Walk provided work under the WPA for Mexican-American workers, as they created the pedestrian walkway and diverted the San Antonio River through the middle of the city.","Although only a young woman, Emma Tenayuca was very aware of the living conditions, misery and poverty of San Antonio’s Mexican-American people.  Fearing more the effects of oppression and discrimination, she battled and spoke out against city leaders and police.  Her legacy lives among a people who’s future was transforming in front of their very eyes.  The Great Depression was a trying time for Americans.  Yet, it also produced leaders, like Tenayuca, who dedicated their lives to holding America and the American people accountable in “Order to form a more perfect union.”"],"display_date":"1932 - 1947","search_date":"1939-12-31","locations":[{"id":23160,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"Bexar, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1042,"tag":"Mexican-American"},{"id":1080,"tag":"Emma Tenayuca"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1082,"tag":"San Antonio, Texas"},{"id":1083,"tag":"San Antonio River Walk"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":1085,"tag":"WPA"},{"id":1086,"tag":"CCC"},{"id":1087,"tag":"AAA"},{"id":1088,"tag":"Worker's Alliance"},{"id":1089,"tag":"Unemployed Council"},{"id":1090,"tag":"strikes"},{"id":1091,"tag":"Dorothy Frock's Company"},{"id":1092,"tag":"Finck Cigar Company"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}}]}
