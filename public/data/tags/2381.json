This is a word found in much of the literature, both old and new, surrounding the Viola Neighborhood in Greenville, South Carolina. But what kind of transition is this historic neighborhood headed for? The City of Greenville’s master plan reflects an interesting change headed for the surrounding area of Viola. While examining the plans of this revitalization of the area around Stone Avenue, Viola Street shows up on every map. The plans for Stone avenue are vast. They include bringing in more commercial spaces and redesigning the aesthetics of some spaces already there. However, it is not part of the highlighted area that will see renovations or improvements. This report by the City of Greenville explains that there are 71 acres part of the Viola Street Neighborhood. The later part of the twentieth century saw the neighborhood faced with high levels or poverty and crime. As a result, the City of Greenville began the Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy. This plan was highly controversial and is viewed by historians to be a reflection of the racial history of Greenville. The Viola Neighborhood area is predominately black, non-family homes. This is a point made in the Greenville Community Development’s Viola Master Plan.","The result of looking at these maps and plans is understanding that the Viola neighborhood faced many struggles. These struggles were centered on high levels of poverty and crime. This observations leads one to the inevitable question of asking why certain neighborhoods become areas of crime and others stay safe. Also, what role does planned urban development play in this. Authors such as Jane Jacobs would argue that the formulating and forced “revitalization” of a certain area makes the area disingenuous. In the specific instance of the Viola neighborhood, revitalization emphasizes bringing in more families. However, actions such as these are a threat to the current climate of the area.","It must be considered if there is the threat of quasi0gentrification during these efforts to “revitalize” and “regenerate” the neighborhood."],"display_date":1990,"search_date":"1990-07-02","locations":[{"id":42482,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"Greenville, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2381,"tag":"Viola"},{"id":2380,"tag":"City Plan"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban U.S. (2014)","school":"Furman University","course_id":135,"school_id":4}},{"id":6197,"title":"Still Segregated?","course_id":135,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/45","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Through looking at the June 1921 Greenville County Economic and Social Directory it becomes clear that there has always been inequality even in small areas within Greenville. The Economic and Social directory, compiled by Guy A. Gullick we see that Greenville County represented many different socio-economic areas. In one section entitled “Facts About the Folks” there is a clear picture painting that represents the guarded interaction between those of different races and socio economic groups.","The 1921 view states, “In Greenville County, as in all the counties there are two systems of schools, one maintained for the whites, the other for the Negroes. It is clearly evident that the system for the whites is superior to the one for the Negroes, and naturally so. Although the whites deserve a better system, at the same time the negroes should not be disregarded, but should be give what is due them” (Gullick 65). This viewpoint represents why Greenville County specifically had so much trouble desegregating.","This struggle is explained by W.E. Solomon in a 1955 article. Solomon explains that there had been no effort by public officials to desegregate schools, despite the Supreme Court ruling in 1954 that public school segregation was unconstitutional. In 1960 Bob Jones, Sr. delivered a sermon entitled “Is Segregation Scriptural.” This sermon was centered on promoting the idea that advocating integration was challenging the natural order of God. Though this seems preposterous now that Greenville County has integrated, why is the Viola neighborhood still socio-economically segregated.","Today there is still a socio-economic disparity. When looking at the site Zillow almost all of the houses that come up are foreclosures. Additionally, zoning of schools for these homes represents a school system that is not as good as other predominately white and upper socio-economic schools. It is astonishing how despite almost a century elapsing since 1921, Viola still represents a distinctly separated and segregated area of Greenville."],"display_date":"1945 - 1970","search_date":"1957-12-31","locations":[{"id":27734,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"Greenville, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":2381,"tag":"Viola"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":2408,"tag":"Schools"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban U.S. (2014)","school":"Furman University","course_id":135,"school_id":4}}]}
