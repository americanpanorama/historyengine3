It was November 1823 when Osborne and Seely packed the <em>Mary and Hannah </em>with goods from the West including eight hundred bushels of wheat, tons of butter, and barrels of beans. After the boat was packed, the crew took off for New York City by means of the Seneca Cayuga Canal, Erie Canal and the Hudson River. The two planned on making it to New York City and being able to sell their goods as well as purchase goods to bring back to the Geneva area. The <em>Mary and Hannah</em> traveled the 430 miles in an unheard of fourteen days. After the arrival of the boat in New York City, a gathering occurred at the local New York Coffee House on Saturday November 22, 1823 to celebrate the accomplishments of the Canal and the crew. In Front of one hundred excited guests the men were awarded with a silver ewer made by silversmith William Gale with a sketch of the <em>Mary and Hannah</em>.","That this voyage took place solely on New York’s canals, changed the transportation system and the market economy. Such a long trip had never been taken using the newly constructed Canal system, and never before had any traveled the canals with such large amounts of commodities. The transportation of commodities was so important and revolutionary at this time because it was able to increase intra-state commerce. Thus, commerce facilitated with the Market Revolution because it allowed for the sale of a surplus of crops larger region. This trip demonstrates the influence the canal system would ultimately have an impact on the economy on New York State and eventually the North’s industrial expansion."," "," "],"display_date":"November 23, 1823","search_date":"1823-11-23","locations":[{"id":8714,"lat":42.9168767241,"lng":-76.5542562068,"zoom":9,"place":"CAYUGA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":564,"tag":"Market Revolution"},{"id":563,"tag":"Erie Canal"},{"id":562,"tag":"Seneca Cayuga Canal"},{"id":561,"tag":"Canal"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4953,"title":"The Proclaimed Truth behind the Erie Canal","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-02-07","end_date":"1821-02-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 7, 1821, an article in the <em>Geneva Palladium</em> attempted to vindicate the claims of the progenitor of the Erie Canal.  The author of the article claimed that while DeWitt Clinton was often credited with the creation of the Erie Canal, Philip Schuyler and Elkanah Watson are in fact the true progenitors of this magnificent waterway.  With the help of Robert Troup’s pamphlet published in 1821, the author claimed that because the construction of the Erie Canal would not have been started without the Lake Canal Policy, whoever drafted this policy was indeed the true creator of the Erie Canal.  Troup’s pamphlet issued “a vindication of the claim of Elkanah Watson, to the merit of projecting the Lake Canal Policy, as created by the Canal Act of March, 1792; and also a vindication of the claim of the late General Philip Schuyler, to the merit of drawing that act, and procuring its passage through the Legislature.  The author of the article agreed with Robert Troup’s claim that the policies of the late 18<sup>th</sup> century were responsible for implementing a new mode of transportation in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  This article addressed the conflicting views behind the projection of the Erie Canal in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.","Both Robert Troup and the author of the article in the <em>Geneva Palladium</em> firmly believed that General Philip Schuyler was responsible for drawing up the Canal Act of March, 1792, and that Elkanah Watson was responsible for carrying out the Act itself and making sure it was passed. But why was this article even published in the newspaper in the first place?  The author admits Troup’s publication of his pamphlet was a way of promoting what he saw as the truth behind the Erie Canal; DeWitt Clinton is the man generally associated with the Erie Canal, but Troup is suggesting that Clinton was not the only one responsible for the creation of the canal.  Identifying the progenitors of the Erie Canal would allow for certain individuals to come away with a sense of pride and vindication for having been responsible for the origins of the canal project. We can gather from the author’s analysis of Troup’s pamphlet that one person must not be accredited for the creation of the Erie Canal, but a collaboration of different ideas, observations, and policies over time led to the final product."],"display_date":"February 7, 1821","search_date":"1821-02-07","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":571,"tag":"Robert Troup"},{"id":570,"tag":"DeWitt Clinton"},{"id":569,"tag":"Philip Schuyler"},{"id":568,"tag":"Elkanah Watson"},{"id":567,"tag":"Internal Improvements"},{"id":566,"tag":"Public Works"},{"id":565,"tag":"Lake Canal Policy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":564,"tag":"Market Revolution"},{"id":563,"tag":"Erie Canal"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4986,"title":"<strong>John Johnston’s Tile Drainage and its Profound Effects on Agriculture</strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-01","end_date":"1852-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["John Johnston was an immigrant from Scotland who brought the tile drainage technique to the United States in 1821.  Once he arrived he immediately traveled to and settled in upstate New York after he bought a cheap plot of land.  The reason for its low price was because it was believed to be unprofitable soil.  But Johnston started to raise animals and slowly integrated his tile drainage idea throughout his farm.  Tile drainage is a system where farmers add drain tiles in their soil, which allows crops to grow stronger roots, effectively allowing them to absorb more nutrients. By 1838, Johnston was disliked by many of his neighbors because he was producing nearly six times the bushels of wheat per acre than they were.  But Johnston was not secretive about his methods and told people it was due to this tile drainage system. He emphasized the fact that the land in the Finger Lake region was flooded and in using tiles a farmer could drain excess water, thus increasing crop yield. People of the area did not believe him and just called his success luck.","Tile Drainage in American farming did not become a popular tool until 1848, when Robert Swan finally listened to John Johnston.  Robert Swan was a wealthy man who made his money in the city before moving to upstate New York.  He was John Johnston’s neighbor and the first man to be willing to give Johnston a chance.  In his diary, Robert Swan slowly unfolds his opinions of Johnston’s tile drainage system, a very influential farming tool, which individually revolutionized agriculture in upstate New York.  On August 10<sup>th</sup> 1848, Robert Swan wrote in his Memorandum. that Mr. John Johnston, “thinks tiles are the best method laid 2.5 feet deep in the ground; cost of tiles 28 cents, ditching 15 cents cost altogether 40 cents for rod.”  Displayed here, is a monumental moment in American agricultural production because immediately following this confrontation, Swan refitted his entire farm with Johnston’s tile drainage system.","Johnston and Swan farmed their land during a transitional time in American farming.  With the help of some influential neighbors and the president of the New York State Agricultural Society, many upstate farmers soon adopted Johnston’s tile system.  Among these influential neighbors were Ben F. Whartenby, the manufacturer, and John Delafield, president of the New York State Agricultural Society.  Delafield’s advocacy of the drainage system, especially in his lectures and speeches, helped integrate tile drainage into farming.  These four men remodeled upstate New York farming during the Market Revolution, helping transition self-sufficient family farming into commercially profit based businesses to."],"display_date":"1848 - 1852","search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":9090,"lat":42.7999140458,"lng":-76.8297839055,"zoom":9,"place":"SENECA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":564,"tag":"Market Revolution"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}}]}
