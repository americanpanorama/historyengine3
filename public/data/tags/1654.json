Construction for the original center, the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, began in 1948 and the center opened in 1953. On November 4, 1997, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in honor of the new clinical research center that would be opened as an addition to the 44-year-old Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center. This center would be a 4-wing, 250-bed hospital and would be able to conduct the most advanced clinical research and better cater to patients’ needs. Among federal buildings, the two buildings constituting the NIH Clinical Center, are second in size only to the Pentagon.","The ceremony for the new center, to be named after Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, was attended by Sen. Hatfield himself, as well as Vice President Al Gore, along with more than 500 guests and dignitaries. At the ceremony, Vice President Al predicted that the NIH Clinical Centers would be able to make medical breakthroughs in research. Among the noted speakers at the groundbreaking ceremony, several patients of the Clinical Center gave testimonies to their benefits from the research advances.","The construction of the NIH Clinical Center marked a significant change in medical history, as much of the research that was being done was basic laboratory research, and the greatest gap was in clinical research. Once people recognized that collaboration between disciplines could result in the true advancement of medicine, the scope of laboratory and clinical research expanded to meet the changing techniques and demands of the medical field. The opening of the original Clinical Center in 1953 marked a decade long transformation of the NIH from a local, small federal agency to the powerful research center that fueled all biomedical research. This redefinition of the NIH was due to 3 US Public Health Service officers being able to convince both the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, along with the US Congress, to allow the NIH to expand, develop a research hospital, and establish a national program of grants.  At the time, doctors proposed the need for more changes in the NIH system to reinvigorate the tradition of clinical investigation and incorporate more innovation. With this came the establishment of the NIH Clinical Center, and though it was originally believed that the amount of research must be kept relatively small to be an outstanding research institute, the great success of the NIH Clinical Center and the invaluable medical advances warranted the expansion of the center and the growth of the research.","During Senator Mark O. Hatfield’s service in the United States Senate for 30 years and service as chairman of the committee on appropriations for 8 years, he developed a commitment to medical research. With the support from influential government figures, such as Sen. Hatfield, such expansions and advances in medical research were possible and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center was able to become a reality. The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center opened in 2005 and is a $596 million technological spectacle. This hospital space consists of 4 patient care wings with 242 inpatient beds. The two clinical and research wings of the new building meet at a crossroads, which is designed to function like a town square. In this space, there are alcoves for meetings, floating staircases and open walkways with areas for chairs and couches to allow individuals to interact, encouraging normal interactions between patients and researchers as well. There is a glass-enclosed atrium, lending views of the landscaped courtyards. In the patient rooms, there are large, low windows that allow the patients lying in bed to see views of the courtyards below them. In the children’s unit, unique light fixtures were designed with colored marbles, so children could recognize their own rooms, and paw prints or stars were painted on the ceiling to amuse and comfort children while they were lying in bed. The redesign and modernization of the new Clinical Center demonstrates the growing importance and emphasis on clinical research in the medical field."],"display_date":"November 4, 1997","search_date":"1997-11-04","locations":[{"id":40842,"lat":39.1365976774,"lng":-77.2045056739,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5681,"title":"The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 and its Deinstitutionalizing Effect on Saint Elizabeth's Hospital","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"10/31/63","end_date":"10/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Due to a growing need for mental health services, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was built by the United States Congress as a result of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Act of 1852. The Institution opened in Washington, DC in 1855 as the “Government Hospital for the Insane”. A prominent leader in the mental health field, Dorthea Dix, lobbied for the construction of the facility and founded the facility with the goal of providing the \"most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.” Before this, many of the patients that could be considered “insane” were simply put in jail and were not receiving the care they needed. The name of the facility was later changed to Saint Elizabeth’s in 1916 because it temporarily provided medical care for wounded soldiers during the Civil War and those that were being treated were reluctant to tell people that they were being cared for at a mental institution. Instead they used the name of the colonial area the hospital was originally built on, Saint Elizabeth’s. Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was the first government-run mental institution in the country and was one of the largest mental institutions in the country. The hospital was a pioneer in mental health care at the time of its existence. At its prime in the 1940’s, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was home to over 7,000 patients.","Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital now operates with a small fraction of that number of patients, largely due to a certain historical event, the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. This Act, fully titled the “Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963,” promoted community-based health care and provided federal funding for such facilities. One of the main purposes of this act to was provide government assistance “in improving mental health through grants for construction of community mental health centers.” The government began to fund the construction of outpatient facilities in order to allow mental patients to live more normal lives. Prior to this, mental hospitals were what Erving Goffman would consider “total institutions,” meaning that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was a place in which all of the patients’ activities took place with a large group of others on a schedule, which shut the patients off from the rest of society. This act led to a considerable amount of deinstitutionalization all over the country. The total number of mentally ill patients that were institutionalized went from 650,000 in 1955 to less than 150,000 in 1983. The act, in conjunction with the quickly deteriorating living conditions at the hospital, meant that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was no exception.  With the passage of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, more patients opted for outpatient care and the number of patients at the hospital steadily declined."],"display_date":"October 31, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-31","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5683,"title":"Autopsy Dictates Asylum Goals: New Traditions from Unique Events","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-07-08","end_date":"1882-07-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After Dr. William W. Godding, the 2<sup>nd</sup> superintendent of Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, DC, witnessed the autopsy of Charles Guiteau, his viewpoint on the pathology of the insane was solidified and, therefore, resulted in the drastic alteration of the mission, practices, and clinical direction of Saint Elizabeth’s. The hospital was established by an act of Congress in 1852 and opened in 1855 as the first federal mental hospital and the first public mental hospital in DC. It was purposed to be a model of humane care and enlightened, curative treatment practices[1] as it strove to bring high-quality psychiatric attention to the poor.[2]","The autopsy in question was a result of events stemming from the 1881 assassination of President Garfield.[3] On July 2 in Washington, DC, Guiteau shot President Garfield who died 79 days later from botched medical care.[4] The murder trial of Guiteau was the first highly publicized forensic battle, pitting leading psychiatrists and neurologists against each other, as Guiteau said a deity instructed him to kill Garfield for the good of the nation.[5] Guiteau demonstrated other seemingly insane antics throughout his trial hinting that he was “off his nut.”[6] Despite these antics, the prosecution argued that Guiteau’s only affliction was “moral depravity.”[7] At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Guiteau capable of discerning right and wrong and, therefore, condemned him to death.[8]","After Guiteau was hung, Dr. Godding witnessed the autopsy performed by D.S. Lamb, MD; the results of which were published on July 8, 1882.[9] Despite rejection of the insanity plea, the autopsy found “pathologic changes suggestive of chronic disease of cerebral vessels,” resulting in a flood of articles claiming Guiteau had suffered from a mental illness.[10] Afterwards, Dr. Godding altered his mission for the hospital, to depart “in the direction…of pathological changes left behind by insanity”[11] in order to better understand and treat mental disorders.[12] Dr. Godding’s decision was revolutionary. In the late 1800s, pathology was developing as a basic science, yet neuropathologic correlation with clinical and demonstrable mental health behavior had not developed.[13] To further the new goals and mission of Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital, Dr. Godding appointed Dr. Isaac W. Blackburn as special pathologist to the hospital in 1884;[14] the first full-time pathologist in a public mental health hospital in the United States.[15]","This autopsy and appointment had long-lasting effects on the physical facilities at Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital as Blackburn established a tradition of innovative research and training that flourished at Saint Elizabeth’s for 100 years.[16] Also, Dr. William Alanson White, the 4<sup>th</sup> superintendent, established a psychology laboratory and formed the first psychotherapy department in any mental hospital in the United States.[17] In conclusion, despite the cessation of the research mission at Saint Elizabeth’s, the legacy of this tradition is still mediating the experience of practitioners, researchers, and the mental health population today.[18]","[1] Jogues R.

It was one of only two African-American medical schools to meet the academic standards of the Flexner Report. It offers degrees in dentistry, medicine, and public health.[1]"," ","In fall 1997, the president of Meharry went to the vice chancellor for health affairs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with a proposition to form a “strategic, mutually beneficial alliance”[2]. Beneficial, because it would allow both institutions to continue providing services to Nashville’s medically underserved population. One year later, the board of trustees of both institutions approved the alliance[3]."," ","Chatman identified several factors affecting the decision to form an alliance- the need for an efficient public hospital, shared challenges presented by TennCare- primarily its reimbursement rate, and commitments to enhancing medical education, research, and the health of the community[4]"," ","On Jan. 1, 1999 Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University Medical Center announced an alliance converging at Nashville General Hospital- sharing the facility, their collective staff, and the patient population. It was described as an “unprecedented partnership”[5]. It was a uniquely beneficial merger because Meharry and Vanderbilt focused on distinct areas of care- Meharry more on family medicine and primary care, while Vanderbilt was highly specialized.[6] As a result, they complemented each other very nicely."," ","During the time of the merger, some of Meharry’s faculty and administration worried that it would be engulfed and lost in the larger institution that was the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. As the president of Meharry’s Faculty Senate stated, “We can compliment each other, but we have two different missions and we need to be careful.”[7]"," ","This, along with the financial benefits of the merger helped to quiet the criticisms. Said E. Ramone Segree, senior vice president for institutional advancement who used the alliance to raise money toward Meharry’s five-year $124 million capital fund-raising campaign, “It’s a masterful partnership.”[8]"," ","Thus, this alliance was born out of a desire to provide better and more stable care to a medically underserved population. The economic model of serving this population with low reimbursement rate of TennCare was unsustainable. In order to maintain the cultural practice of treating this population and the educational requirement of having medical students work in the hospital providing this care, this alliance was formed."," ","[1] Vera Stevens Chatman, Juanita F.

Meharry is particularly important institution because it was the first medical school in the South for African Americans. The school is still operating successfully today even though it has faced many hardships. Without this school African Americans would have had very little chance becoming physicians but more importantly many would not have had access to medical care.","In 1904 the first of a series of events began that would put the schools ability to remain open in jeopardy; the AMA formed a council to overhaul medical education in America. This committee adopted two standards to medical education. The first being that applicants to medical school have to have at least two years of college with studies mostly devoted to the sciences. The second standard stated that medical school will consist of two years of anatomy and physiology and two years of clinical work at a teaching hospital.  The committee then appointed Abraham Flexner to do a survey of the country’s medical schools and to promote their agenda (Flexner).","This reform affected African American medical schools much differently than they did white medical colleges. After the Flexner report most of the white medical colleges quickly accepted the plan while none of the African American colleges did. The reason for not accepting these standards was because the African American medical schools would not be able to cover the costs of operation while still following the new standards. White schools were able to adhere to these standards because they had endowments and large donors. Black schools had very little money coming in from donors and small or no endowments. Schools like Meharry would not be able to fill all of their classroom seats because they would not be able to find enough African Americans that qualified for admission. This lack of qualified students was because most African American colleges don’t even offer the upper level science courses that the AMA recommended. The AMA’s new standards made it nearly impossible for Meharry and schools like it to stay open (Savitt).","The AMA instituted a grading system to report which schools were satisfactory in their eyes and which ones deserve to be shut down. Students graduating from schools below a certain grade would find it very difficult to attain a medical license thus negating their years of training. All of the African American schools graded very poorly and by 1923 only two African American schools remain. Meharry was one of those schools partially thanks to a donation from the Carnegie Foundation. Meharry would continue to struggle to survive for years to come (Savitt).","The goal of the AMA was to improve medical education in America. It may have achieved that but it also set back African Americans several decades in the field of medicine. Without the courage of Meharry the affect of these new regulations would have been far worse for African Americans."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1910 - January 1, 1923","search_date":"1916-07-02","locations":[{"id":16613,"lat":36.169373125,"lng":-86.7847981408,"zoom":9,"place":"Davidson, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1660,"tag":"Flexner"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":6476,"title":"Vietnam Veteran, Ron Kovic, recalls lack of care in V.A. hospital.","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"3/6/68","end_date":"3/6/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a Vietnamese rifle severed his spinal cord, Ron Kovic bounced around Vietnam field hospitals and eventually landed in a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in New York. Kovic found himself being treated in unbearable conditions by nurses and doctors who were often being overworked and unsupported. Kovic laid in his own filth at times while hospital staff could not make it to him to clean up his area or change his bedpan. Not only was the hospital run down and grossly understaffed but the nurses and doctors often had horrible attitudes towards the war and the veterans. Nurses even told Kovic how “nobody gives a crap about the war in Vietnam” while rats run around the filthy floors scavenging food. Meanwhile, the government failed to recognize severe problems in their VA hospitals.","            Throughout the 1960s and 1970s thousands of Vietnam veterans were coming home wounded from the war. Whether they came home with a bullet wound or missing a limb, they often spent time in VA hospitals across the nation. These hospitals often were kept in poor conditions mainly because of the lack of nurses and money that the government was spending on the war. Wounded veteran Kovic recalled that, \"It never makes any sense to us how the government can keep asking for money for weapons and leave us lying in our own filth.” The government prioritized their spending more on the war effort and less on the veterans and their treatment after returning home.","            The conditions in these hospitals and treatment of patients were often made worse because of the nursing shortage that was occurring at the time. As Kara Dixon has noted, army nurses during World War Two often numbered around forty or fifty thousand. During the Vietnam War this number reached an all time low of less than five thousand army nurses. This shortage caused many issues in the dark days of the war in Vietnam when thousands of soldiers arrived home wounded and in need of assistance.","            Since the lack of Army nurses was growing during the Vietnam War this forced the hiring of many civilian nurses and doctors to work in VA hospitals. This often led to a lack of personal care from the nurses and an understaffing of many of the hospitals. It was not uncommon for civilian nurses to oppose the war and they would let veterans know about it often. Kovic remembers vividly the day when a hospital nurse came to him and said “You can take your Vietnam and shove it up your ass.\" A comment like this showed the overall attitude of some of the nurses and the poor conditions that many of these veterans would have to return home to after serving their country."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"March 6, 1968","search_date":"1968-03-06","locations":[{"id":21194,"lat":40.8370495,"lng":-73.8654295,"zoom":8,"place":"Bronx, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":292,"tag":"Vietnam"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":2873,"tag":"Veteran"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6532,"title":"Dr. William Wells","course_id":154,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/17","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the era of segregation, hospitals, hotels, casinos, schools, restaurants and other venues were not receptive to hosting African Americans.   When it was possible for those whom had access to these places, often the quality of the facilities were deplorable compared their white counterparts.  In addition to the poor quality, there were fewer medical facilities and physicians for people of color.  Surgeons were almost nonexistent.  It was close to impossible for African Americans to get into medical school even if they had excellent grades because of the color of their skin. Even if an African American completed medical school it was difficult to find a good hospital that would hire them because of their skin color[1].  As a race with so many obstacles in their way, there happened to be one man who defeated the odds, Dr. William Monroe Wells. Dr. William Wells was a prestigious African American Doctor and business owner, whom catered  to African Americans during segregation.","            Dr. Wells is most commonly known for being an incredible and well known African American doctor in Orlando. Dr. Wells was born in Ft. Gaines, Georgia in 1889. After completing medical school at Meharry Medical College he moved to Orlando in 1917. He dedicated his life to helping African Americans  so that they could receive the best medical care possible, even if they could not afford it. During World War II, Dr. Wells was the only African American doctor in Orlando. This was a shocking fact because white doctors refused to care for African Americans. This is important because at one point Dr. Wells was the only physician in Orlando that would be willing to see, help and treat African Americans. Dr. Wells was most famous for delivering over 5,000 babies in Orlando during his time practicing medicine.  Wells was not only famous for delivering African American babies, but he also treated patients with scarlet fever, influenza and pneumonia. He helped African Americans who were sick or in labor even though he knew they would not be able to ever pay him.  Dr. Well’s profound contribution was that he made it possible for many African Americans to receive quality medical care during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in Orlando, Florida[2]. This is profound because without Dr. Wells African Americans would not have received medical attention during this time.","            Dr. William Wells was also a member of the Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce and provided his information to the local business directory so that African Americans seeking medical attention would be able to contact him. The 1948 Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce was the primary source for this history engine because it showed real life advertisements and provided a directory to which African Americans could find safe reliable healthcare. African Americans could rely on these businesses owned and run by other African Americans, so they would not face discrimination[3].  For African Americans in Orlando, Dr. Wells not only created the availability for healthcare but also provided that healthcare without discrimination through the Negro Chamber of Commerce.","            Not only was Dr. William Wells passionate about providing medical care to African Americans, but he also wanted to provide safe places for them as well. In 1926, Dr. Wells received a building permit from the City of Orlando and constructed the Wells’ Hotel. During this time the hotels were segregated making it very difficult for African Americans to find safe accommodations while traveling.  Attached to this hotel Dr. Wells’ also built and owned a popular Casino called South Street Casino. The Casino was a popular place for famous African American singers and entertainers[4]. Dr. Wells wanted to provide a safe lodging for rest after their shows.  Dr. Wells predicted the dangers for African Americans traveling without a place to stay during the era of segregation.  He also was able to create a venue in the hotel space, which allowed a safe place for African Americans to let loose and have fun.  It was obvious that Dr. Wells not only cared about providing healthcare, he was also passionate about offering lodging and an entertaining nightlife for African Americans to enjoy safely[5].","            Dr. Williams Wells is a crucial part of African American History in Orlando because he was passionate about providing healthcare, lodging, and nightlife to African Americans. During a time when African Americans had no option for medical care, Dr. Wells was a saving grace by providing his medical assistance. Imagine the fear of not having access to safe medical care. That was the reality for African Americans before Dr. Wells broke through the barriers of color in modern medicine. Imagine traveling and not having a safe place to stay; this was also a reality until Dr. Wells opened his hotel and casino. Access to healthcare and a physician should have been every persons right, but this was not the case for African Americans during the 1920s – 1960s. Without Dr. Wells citizens of color in Orlando would not have had access to healthcare when they were ill or while giving birth. Dr. Wells was responsible for the healthy and safe deliveries of over 5,000 babies in Orlando alone, which speaks volumes of his impact to the black community. Dr. William Wells was an incredible doctor, businessman, and leader among the African American Community."," "," "," ","[1] \"History - Opening Doors: Contemporary African American Academic Surgeons.\" N.p., n.d.
