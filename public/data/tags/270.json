Segregation and discrimination had reached a point that was no longer tolerable, and according to the <em>Pittsburgh Courier</em>, it was time for a campaign. The “Double V Campaign,” as it was called, stood for two victories for black Americans: a victory at home and a victory abroad. ","            This campaign was orchestrated by the <em>Pittsburgh Courier, </em>a weekly black newspaper that helped influence public opinion among black Americans. According to the <em>Courier</em>'s February 14<sup>th</sup> headline, “The Courier's Double 'V' for a double victory campaign gets country-wide support.” This support showed that black America was tired of being oppressed and ready for change. The Double V campaign helped tremendously the plight of black Americans. Blacks everywhere were discriminated against based on their color, and the armed forces at this time was no exception. If blacks were allowed entrance into the army, they were only given menial jobs such as cooks or stewards. The Double V campaign called for integration and for the possibility of fighting for freedom everywhere. The <em>Courier</em> went on to say in its’ February 14<sup>th</sup> article, “We, as colored Americans are determined to protect our country, our form of government and the freedoms which we cherish for ourselves and the rest of the world, therefore we have adopted the Double ‘V’ war cry—victory over our enemies at home and victory over our enemies on the battlefields abroad. Thus in our fight for freedom we wage a two-pronged attack against our enslavers at home and those abroad who will enslave us. WE HAVE A STAKE IN THIS FIGHT...WE ARE AMERICANS, TOO!” Not only did the campaign gather blacks together in support of racial equality, but afforded them the opportunity to feel part of a bigger struggle for freedom everywhere. The shared struggles of black America were also felt by black service men in the armed forces. According to Lawrence P. Scott, a black airman in the 99th, and an eventual Tuskegee Airman, \"every man in the 99th was aware that the success of the 99th would impact the status of blacks in the Army Air Force and the army as a whole and that each man performed his job as if the race depended on him.\"","            At war’s end, the campaign would serve as a reminder of why black service men and women fought. Not only was the war fought to free enslaved people abroad, but was also fought for the equality of black Americans at home who were willing to fight and die for their country. This campaign would later help to serve as an impetus for the future civil rights movement of the 1960s that would eventually grant black Americans the equality for which they lived, fought, and died."," "],"display_date":"February 7, 1942 - February 14, 1942","search_date":"1942-02-10","locations":[{"id":27548,"lat":40.468833638,"lng":-79.9812076782,"zoom":9,"place":"Allegheny, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":269,"tag":"Double V Campaign"},{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":5639,"title":"Journey to Freedom: The Bethany Veney Story","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-01-01","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Bethany Veney recalls her time as a slave in her autobiography, <em>The Narrative of Bethany Veney: a Slave Woman. </em> Born into slavery Bethany had little memory of her early life, but distinctly remembered being a source of entertainment for her master by singing and dancing. Although Bethany never mentioned feelings of objectification or dehumanization, which Hartman discusses in <em>Scenes of Subjection,</em> about entertaining her master she described the experience as, \"all manner of grotesque grimaces, gestures, and positions.\" She did not understand the meaning of the songs she was forced to sing, but believed that her master and his friends did not understand them as well. There are moments throughout the narrative as a whole where feelings of loneliness or helplessness shine through although she never expresses her opinion because it would be uncharacteristic for a slave to do so.","Bethany Veney was one the slaves in Virginia who never had to endure being sold at the market and worry about being separated from her children by distance. Although Bethany was eventually separated from her children, she managed to reunite with them later on in her life when she became free slave. According to Johnson in <em>Soul by Soul</em>, slaves at the market would often share gossip with one another, but Bethany only had contact with the other slaves she worked with. She did not have to deal with being examined by potential buyers or fear being sold in public. Bethany was sold twice in her life, once after her first master died and the second time she asked to be sold alongside her daughter because she did not like her master, whom she described as harsh and cruel. It was a rare occurrence for slaves to arrange their own sale, but Bethany was unlike most slaves.","When Bethany was finally freed from being a slave she moved about the Northeast at her leisure, often spending time in Worcester, Massachusetts where she would eventually buy a house and settle down. Bethany was also eventually reunited with her children and grandchildren and regularly went down to the South to visit them during the year. In comparison to other slave narratives during the 1800s Bethany did not have a terrible life. There is no mention of her being beaten or threatened by her masters throughout the narrative, nor was she ever sold at the public slave market. Bethany recorded her story so others would know what it was like to be a slave in Virginia who despite the odds managed to become free and live out the remainder of her life as she pleased."],"display_date":1889,"search_date":"1889-07-02","locations":[{"id":14137,"lat":38.6199595082,"lng":-78.484150089,"zoom":9,"place":"PAGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":453,"tag":"Runaway Slaves"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"},{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":522,"tag":"Massachusetts"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5644,"title":"The Commodity of Self: A Tale from the Narrative of Elleanor Eldridge","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1794-03-01","end_date":"1799-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1815, at the very young age of ten, the heroine of our narrative, Elleanor Eldridge, lost her mother. Elleanor's life story was penned in her narrative, <em>Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge.</em> Elleanor was born into a very perculiar set of circumstances. Born in Rhode Island, she was the daughter of a free African-American Man and a female descendent from the Narrahganset tribe. The death of Elleanor’s mother acted as a catalyst that began Elleanor’s life of “self-government and spirited action”(2). Being born into freedom, she was granted many advantages that others of her race still did not possess. However advantageous the circumstances of her birth were, it still did not negate the inferiority of her position within society. It cannot be forgotten that Elleanor was still an African-American girl living in a highly racialized society. She was also the oldest child of the single-parent household with several siblings that needed to be taken care of. While Elleanor was not a slave in the general sense of the word, she was still a slave to the society she was born into. The death of her mother caused Elleanor to sell herself back into a institutionalized version of slavery, where Elleanor was a commodity to the people she served.","Upon the tragic death of her mother, Elleanor packed all of her belongings into a small leather rucksack, kissed each of her brothers and sisters, said goodbye to her father, and set out on a long, dirt road to seek work at the home of her mother’s former employer, the Bakers. The Bakers were an affluent Rhode Island family, who had been very fond of Elleanor's mother. Elleanor, possessing much of her mother's beauty, skill, and charms, was the natural choice for her replacement. Yet, before agreeing to the generous terms of employment that the Baker family had offered her, the ambitious ten-year-old proceeded to bargain the terms of her employment. Through this, Elleanor had placed herself in the “space between person and thing”(1). She was no longer in complete possession of of her own circumstances, and by extension was guilty of selling herself as a commodity, which could be bargained for. However, Elleanor had taken control of the situation through making her own choice of employer. She felt satisfied with the choice she had made for the Bakers maintained a level of respect for Elleanor and possessed the uncommon view of their servants as “belonging to the same great family of man”(2). Elleanor was aware that not all masters shared the same ideals as the Bakers did. Most employers maintained the practice of treating their servants as objects, instead of “accountable beings--as persons indeed, capable of independent thought, feeling, and action--susceptible alike of pleasure and pain, they are considered as the mere appendages of luxury”(2). Through choosing her own employer, power over Elleanor changed hands in Elleanor's favor.","As many faithful years with the Baker Family passed by, Elleanor continued to affect the conditions of her servitude on her own terms. After a year’s work, Elleanor requested that her weekly wages be raised to two cents. From a very young age, Elleanor learned the value of her services and herself as a commodity. From there, she set higher standards for the type of employer she was interested in working for. She was able to have control over her employment circumstances, which was a rarity for her time. She may have had to place herself back into a system she had been lucky to escape at birth, but Elleanor was able to regain control of her own personhood and avocation. She used her circumstances to carve out a place for herself within society as an individual blessed with the freedoms and liberties granted to her."," "],"display_date":"March 1794 - March 1799","search_date":"1796-09-14","locations":[{"id":15349,"lat":41.7585954468,"lng":-71.3839450728,"zoom":7,"place":"Kent, Rhode Island"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":1605,"tag":"Freed Slave"},{"id":1606,"tag":"Liberty"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":6388,"title":"William Green's Journey Towards Becoming a Freeman","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From the beginning of his life, William Green’s freedom was taken from him. William Green was born in Oxford Neck, Maryland about three months before his mother was set free. Green’s owner, Miss Goldsbury, at her death set all of her slaves free and their children were to be free when they became of age. William Green was therefore entitled to his freedom at the age of twenty-five, but he was cheated out of it. When Miss Goldsbury died Green fell into the hands of Mr. Singleton. Mr. Singleton, was going to take Green to the South to sell him, but Green’s mother begged him not to take her son away. He agreed that if she found someone to buy Green that he would sell him to them. Edward Hamilton bought Green and when he was sold the fact that Green was to be free at the age of twenty-five was not mentioned and therefore Green was sold as a slave for life. Green lived with his mother until he turned nine, at which time he was taken to work in the house of Mr. Hamilton. Until he was twenty, Green worked in Mr. Hamilton’s house as a body-servant, a race-rider, and later a waiter. When Mr. Hamilton’s daughter, Miss Henrietta Hamilton, married Dr. Jenkings, Green was given as part of her wedding dowry. Dr. Jenkings was a disagreeable man and Green did not like him. Green’s job was to wait and take care of things in the house, go on errands, and ride with the doctor when he went to see patients. One day, Green got into a quarrel with the doctor over how Green spent his leisure time. The doctor cracked a whip at Green and they started to fight until they were both out of breath. After that, Green told Dr. Jenkings that if he ever whipped him again Green would never do another day’s work for him or any other man. Green would remain with the doctor for about a year following the incident. Green was not satisfied with being a slave and had decided that he “had spent as much time in slavery as he was willing to” (Green, 15) and made a plan to escape with his friend, Joseph. On their journey, Green and Joseph met many friends who aided them on their way towards freedom. They were able to make it to New York and later Springfield, Massachusetts where Green was able to get a job, settle down, and live the life of a freeman.","William Green was not satisfied with being a slave and he was willing to stand up for himself and his freedom. Saidiya Hartman writes in her book <em>Scenes of Subjection</em> that “the exercise of power was inseparable from its display because domination depended upon demonstrations of the slaveholder’s dominion and the captive’s abasement. The owner’s display of mastery was just as important as the legal title to slave property.” A slaveholder showing his power was essential to his domination. Many people believed that slaves were suppose to submit to white people and that it was their job to do so. Dr. Jenkings was not able to exercise complete domination and power over William Green. This is because Green had been apart of Mrs. Jenkings dowry, so he was not one of the Doctor’s slaves and was not his property. Green was one of Mrs. Jenking’s favorite slaves and she had some influence in the way that Green was treated and often “let him have his way.” (Green, 13) With Dr. Jenkings not being able to have complete domination over Green, Green developed the courage to stand up for himself and this was shown with Green’s willingness to disobey his owner and when he told Dr. Jenkings that he would never work another day if he was ever whipped again. When Hartman talks about the brutality of slavery, two of things that she mentions are cruelty and resistance. William Green experienced both of these.  Examples of the cruelty that Green experienced was when he was cheated out of his freedom by being sold as a slave for life and not one who would be free at the age of twenty-five and the way that Green was treated by Dr. Jenkings. Even though Green was dominated and treated with brutality by his masters Green was not afraid to stand up for himself and resist them. Green’s courage grew as he resisted against his master and the act of slavery and as he began to think about freedom. With this courage Green made the decision to run away. It took “all of the nerve and energy that a poor slave can bring to his support to enable him to make up his mind to leave in the precarious manner” (Green, 15) but Green was willing to do so and because of this he was able to become a freeman. "," "],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":52791,"lat":42.1014831,"lng":-72.589811,"zoom":8,"place":"Springfield, Massachusetts"},{"id":52769,"lat":39.0457549,"lng":-76.6412712,"zoom":8,"place":"Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}}]}
