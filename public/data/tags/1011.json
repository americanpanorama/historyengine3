On the day she arrived, Rhoads started her work as an emergency room nurse. She recalls the mass-casualty events the most. For her small unit, mass-casualty was anything more than ten wounded at a time. Mass-casualty situations often taxed supplies such that not enough supplies remained to save everyone. It was the code of the medical staff to try to save, or at least make comfortable, all injured patrons at the clinic including Americans and Vietnamese prisoners of war. Rhoads experienced personal conflict when she could not save an American mine victim, but she saved the Vietnamese man who had laid the mine. Rhoads remembers thinking, “We were short on anesthesia and supplies. And we were giving anesthesia to this POW…what happens if someone comes in like Cliff [mine victim] and we don’t have any anesthesia left because we gave it all to this POW?”","The ethical distribution of medical supplies was a constant issue during the Vietnam War. The code of ethics for medical staff in Vietnam required staff to help anyone that needed aid. The doctors were to stick by principles of justice and accountability. Although some Vietnamese patients were the enemy, the men and women who suffered injuries were a member of some community or a family. Their treatment and care mattered to the living. Colonel Richard Van Ness Ginn, Senior Vice President of Capital Health Services in Virginia states that many doctors throughout Vietnam were faced with the same shortages and the same ethical dilemmas.","In the end Rhoads abided by the medics ethical code and by her own personal moral code. She later said that she was embarrassed that she had ever thought like that. She was raised Catholic and she felt that no good Catholic should ever think like she had. She thought, “God, how can you think that? The tables could be turned, and what if it was Cliff in the POW’s place[?]” However, from time to time Rhoads still found herself thinking, “[k]ill the enemy and save the American.”"," "," "," "],"display_date":"1970 - 1971","search_date":"1970-12-31","locations":[{"id":52694,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":1011,"tag":"Ethics"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5691,"title":"An Uncommon Sentiment","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["H. S. Chamberlain had a problem on his plate back in the mid-twentieth century.  Everyone sought cheap labor in the steel and coal industries, but feared employing certain groups of people because of their behavior.  Blacks treated with trepidation were the majority of workers in these industries.  For the most part, blacks saw nothing but discrimination and fell under the watchful eyes of white owners.  Chamberlain sought to employ more blacks, and to encourage other corporations to do so as well.  However, his peers felt that he must be disillusioned in his pursuits.  In a letter to other owners not only in Tennessee, but to Pennsylvania, and even into the Deep South, he conveyed his position on the matter.","“Around the furnaces, the great bulk of labor is colored labor, it is almost entirely so about the blast furnaces.  As far as experience goes, we have found it is by far the best labor in the South.”  How could one man be so sure of his predicament, and yet, everyone else saw black labor as a necessary evil?  It would seem that racial tensions kept most blacks in the hard, dirty, and underpaid jobs.  While Chamberlain employed these men in the same positions, he had “great success” in his endeavors.  A good number of black laborers had been on the payroll for nearly twenty years, that they “give great satisfaction,” in their duties.","This “great satisfaction” was beset with problems, of course.  Chamberlain’s white employees were extremely prejudice, and fought to keep blacks out of the skilled positions by not agreeing to teach the trade to the black workers.  Though, this is not uncommon in the South, the majority of skilled labor was delegated to the white workers because of racial discrimination.  However, Chamberlain goes on to discuss that it was this prejudice that inhibited the black men’s advancement, not their skills.  Chamberlain goes further, pointing out that as “puddlers,” black men were just as capable.  “Puddling” involved stirring the molten contents of a furnace from above with iron rods, it was one of the most dangerous and hard jobs in the “puddling” style furnaces.  “Fully as good as white men; their yield is as good; they are as steady workmen; they are as reliable in every way, and their product is fully as good as anything that we have got from white labor.”  But the quality of the black laborer’s work wasn’t the predominating factor in where they worked.  If a black man was given a “white man’s job,” white workers had a tendency to lash back with violent strikes…barring whites and blacks from the workplace until they had the matter settled.   So it was not that blacks were unable to do work correctly, or lacked the basic skills to learn and achieve, but it was the racism that divided and segregated their opportunities.  One other man had much the same opinion as Chamberlain.  T. D. Aldrich was a northern industrialist that had moved to Birmingham, Alabama to work as a supervisor.  Aldrich agreed that blacks “as a class are, without exception, the best labor I have ever handled.”","Of course there are always dissenters to an ideal.  J. W. Sloss, the head of the famous Sloss Furnace Company in Birmingham, Alabama, believed “there would be no improvement to substitute white labor for black workers.”  Sloss, like many others, thought that replacing white workers with blacks was a mistake because it raised racial tensions for no reason.  Many would point to this and say that things were done in this way just to keep the workplace at ease, that it wasn’t a racially motivated matter.  However, more than enough evidence shows that blacks were hindered in progress mainly because white workers discriminated heavily against them.  Even the National Labor Union –created in 1866- questioned whether black laborers should be allowed to work in industry because of the racial problems it would create.  Also, there was still the belief that blacks were subservient to whites, harder to educate, and more base in their dealings.  These beliefs were a circumstance that played over and over itself, even to this day.","Throughout history, there has always been a culture or race that was treated as less worthy than their counterparts.  Here in the South it was especially rough on black laborers, however, the northern industries suffered because of these tensions as well.  Blacks would be hired, whites would strike and make demands, and things would be resolved for the good of the business…which often ignored what the needs of the blue-collar black laborers that did the majority of unspecialized work in the coal and steel industries."],"display_date":1950,"search_date":"1950-07-02","locations":[{"id":29463,"lat":35.1808732525,"lng":-85.1648090186,"zoom":9,"place":"Hamilton, Tennessee"},{"id":28563,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1011,"tag":"Ethics"},{"id":1661,"tag":"Coal"},{"id":906,"tag":"Steel industry"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":1665,"tag":"Steel"},{"id":1666,"tag":"Coal Industry"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":1668,"tag":"Racial Tension"},{"id":1669,"tag":"South"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":6771,"title":"A Much Needed Change","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-05-01","end_date":"1847-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","One spring evening in May of 1847, Issac Hays, chairman of the newly established American Medical Association (AMA), stood from his seat surrounded by colleagues, having just finished creating the original code of ethics adopted by the AMA. The code, having since then been the standard of medical ethics in the United States, was modeled heavily on the ethical beliefs of the European physician ad author Thomas Percival, who created the first code of ethics. Up until a code was written and adopted in the U.S., there were no official national means of regulating proper ethical behavior in the healthcare field, and many states themselves lacked laws explicitly stating ethical expectations in the medical profession. Due to this, the code of ethics specifically touched on the need for doctors to recognize the entirety of the power they possessed to not take advantage of it."," ","This code of ethics was eventually commented on by Dr. Austin Flint, president of the AMA in 1883. In this commentary, Flint focused on the importance of physicians upholding their own sense of morality, a topic he felt worthy of extra attention. His commentary was divided into 3 sections: the responsibilities of physicians to their patients, and the duties patients are expected to uphold; the responsibilities physicians have to one another; and the accountability physicians are held to by the public."," ","This was a prime time for a code of ethics to be written and scrutinized, especially with the developments in surgery around that time. With the surgical field gaining popularity within the medical community, questions arose about surgeons’ morals in the operating room, when they were in control of another life. It was common for surgeons to learn to distance their emotions from their patients, which to a certain extent was to be expected—after all, they were cutting into another person before the development of anesthesia. It was expected of the doctor to remain faithful to his patient in accordance with his highest professional requirement—do no harm. There were concerns for physicians’ intentions and ethical accountability that were understandably called into question. The code of ethics was a way to unite all physicians in the states with a common goal, common standards, and a sense of accountability beyond their own conscience."],"display_date":"May 1, 1847 - May 31, 1847","search_date":"1847-05-16","locations":[{"id":11224,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3146,"tag":"Surgery"},{"id":2937,"tag":"United States"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1011,"tag":"Ethics"},{"id":3213,"tag":"History"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
