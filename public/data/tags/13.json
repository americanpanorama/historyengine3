expansion of slavery into Missouri had almost led to a Civil War in 1820, seven years later Northerners worst fears were confirmed with a report by Missouri leaders.  The St. Louis Enquirer published an article that would soon be republished throughout the South trumpeting the success of tobacco crops in the newest slave state.  The soil of Missouri was considered by planters of Maryland and Virginia to be admirably adapted for the cultivation of tobacco and evidently must become a staple commodity of Missouri.  That was evidenced by tobacco crops already having a considerable display in our port'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article certainly pushed the sectionalism already becoming apparent between the Northern and Southern states of America.  The South could look at this new territory's prosperity with pride and ambition. Missouri stood as an example for all the land yet to be settled out west in North America.  It justified the peculiar institution', which abolitionists degraded with such venom, could produce such prosperous results for the slave owners and the nation's economy as a whole.  For the North, it spread greater fear that slavery was not going to just die out like many had predicted.  Tobacco may use up farmland quickly, but states like Missouri now provided thousands of acres to be settled and cultivated by young and idealistic slave owners in the South who could not find land in their native state.  As long as cash crops like tobacco prospered in new territories, the demand for slavery would only increase, not decrease.  This event's simple account of tobacco growth foreshadowed the impending struggle over territorial expansion that would occur from this point all the way up until the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 24, 1827","search_date":"1827-04-24","locations":[{"id":7914,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":47,"title":"Congress Passes the Timber Culture Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-03-03","end_date":"1873-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout the 19th Century, the American government as well as people continued to maintain the desire to push the move out West. Dealing with westward expansion and land ownership, the United States government passed a series of Homestead Laws over the decade in order to promote the settlement of Americans westward. In 1841, Congress passed the Pre-emption Act in response to the demands of the Western states that squatters be able to preempt lands. In this act, Congress allowed settlers to stake claim on land and allotted them 160 acres that could be bought after about 14 months of residence to purchase from the government for as little as 1.25 an acre before it was offered for public sale. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on May 20, 1862, Congress enacted the Homestead Act, which gave a quarter of a section of a township, or 160 acres, of undeveloped land in the West to any family head. However, this act only offered land to those that pledged to live on the acreage for five years. The government also allowed the family head to buy it for 1.25 per acre after six months. The government had previously sold land to settlers in the West for revenue purposes. Yet, as the West became politically stronger, pressure increased upon Congress to guarantee free land to settlers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In March 1873, Congress passed another homestead law, which continued to encourage movement to the west. It was the Timber Culture Act. In this act, Congress authorized the grant of an additional quarter of a section (160 acres) to a homesteader who agreed to plant trees on a quarter (40 acres) of his land. The legislation aided land speculators to seize large holdings. By virtue of this legislation, 65,292 homesteaders received 10,000,000 acres of land. Even in the harsh conditions of the plains, small farmers of a quarter section are not liable to survive a drought, and thousands of acres were needed for cattle and sheep ranches. This act remained in effect for fifteen years."],"display_date":"March 3, 1873","search_date":"1873-03-03","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":53,"title":"Augusta, Georgia Holds an Agricultural Convention","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-02-11","end_date":"1873-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 11, 1873, the Agricultural Convention was held in Augusta, Georgia. The states of Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, and New York were represented. Roughly two hundred delegates attended this conference. At the convention, attendees discussed the economic condition of the South, and they also proposed and passed resolutions to remedy this situation. The main issues debated included the increase of direct trade and immigration, the creation of agricultural societies, the incorporation of stock-raising as well as other economic improvements. All were hoped to develop the South into a more lucrative and productive region of the nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reporting the dealings of the convention, the Charleston Daily News detailed the decisions of the delegates. The topic of direct trade and immigration entailed the establishment of direct railroad lines from the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina to the West as well as the establishment of direct steam connections from the same coasts to Europe. There was also the hopes of increasing immigration of skilled, willing labor from Europe through circulating pamphlets throughout Europe, printed in different languages and revealing the advantages of working in the South. Next, the issue of creating agricultural societies throughout the nation hoped to improve the relations of agriculture to commerce, manufacturers, and all other industries. Many at the convention envisioned that these societies would inform farmers of the necessity of studying improved methods of cultivation and the art of increasing productivity in order to better the output of the South. Another important matter of cultivation discussed involved the possibility of focusing on sheep farming in place of cotton planting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through this convention, it became apparent that the South was making great efforts to rise from their economic struggles that befell on her after the Civil War. Many delegates retained the reality that the economy of the postwar South would remain tied to agriculture. Thus, in calling this convention to session, the Georgia General Assembly was hoping to inaugurate measures which shall accelerate the return of prosperity; and which acting with the force of example shall;enhance by cooperation and combination all the states of the South,' according to the Charleston Daily News. The Agricultural Convention desired to become the springboard to a fresh era of prosperity, leaving behind the humiliation of dependency on other regions of the nation as well as looking forward to a new order of control and success."],"display_date":"February 11, 1873 - February 13, 1873","search_date":"1873-02-12","locations":[{"id":2192,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":109,"title":"Southern Baptist Convention Formed by 293 Representatives of Churches in the Southeastern U.S.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-05-08","end_date":"1845-05-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, a group of Southern Baptists broke away from the Triennial Convention and the American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS) due to differences on the slavery issue.  This particular group of Southern Baptists did not oppose slavery, as the Triennial Convention and the ABHMS had begun to do.  The Baptist Board, situated in Boston, in November of 1844, adopted certain resolutions, one of which stated that if, however, any one should offer himself as a missionary, having slaves, and insist on retaining them as his property, we could not appoint him.  One thing is certain, we can never be a party to any arrangement which would imply approbation of slavery.'&lt;br /&gt;293 delegates from local churches, state conventions, educational institutions, and missionary societies met in Augusta, Georgia, and formed the Southern Baptist Convention, which was led by W. B. Johnson, a pastor from South Carolina.  Although the Northern Baptists (ABHMS) recognized the right of the Southern branch to break away, they described it as a hugely important and momentous act: They have severed, with one blow, the union which has so long existed.  They had united with the North for no prescribed or certain period.  The union was to last during pleasure, and during pleasure only.  The South, therefore, had a right for any cause, or for no cause, to separate from the North.  Still, to sever ties by which the parties had been so long bound together, to draw a dividing line between North and South, was a solemn and momentous act.  It was a deed not to be rashly or hastily done.  No man can calculate the extent of the influence which this single act may exert, not only upon the great work of imparting Christianity to the heathen, but upon the interests, or even the existence, of our common country.'  Geographically restricted to states that would eventually become the Confederacy, the SBC began in 1845 with a total membership of 351,951 in 4,126 local Baptist churches.  The SBC version of the Baptist Church was shaped by early westward migration and life on the trans-Appalachian frontier, an agrarian mode of life, was mainly linked to the common people' and ideas of individualism, and held a strong commitment to missions."],"display_date":"May 8, 1845 - May 12, 1845","search_date":"1845-05-10","locations":[{"id":2189,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":138,"title":"Lien law passed in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-03-01","end_date":"1878-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The South Carolina legislature passed a new and improved lien law on March 1, 1878, to help farmers get credit in order to plant. This law and the benefits it brought helped the agricultural sector of South Carolina's economy to survive following the havoc of previous years. Also the lien law boosted Gov. Wade Hampton's popularity with voters even higher during a reelection year campaign in which he ran unopposed. Due to measures like the lien law, Hampton won an easy victory carrying a majority of both white and black voters.&lt;br /&gt;The law was heralded by many in the state, including the Charleston News and Courier which praised the action as a measure of importance to landowners and merchants and to the public in general.' Generous provisions were included in the law to sweeten the benefits for all involved in agriculture. For example, people who gave farmers advances on items necessary to produce crops were entitled to a lien on the crop which may be made during the year upon the land in the cultivation of which the advances so made have been expended in preference of all other liens existing or otherwise,' according to the paper. This law bolstered a South Carolina economy that had been struggling since the end of the Civil War. Popular measures like lien laws and other tactics were implemented all over the South to help bolster popularity of Bourbon governments after their takeover from Reconstructionist Republicans."],"display_date":"March 1, 1878","search_date":"1878-03-01","locations":[{"id":11458,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":184,"title":"Southern Railroad System Purchases the Carolina Midland\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-05-12","end_date":"1899-05-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A newspaper in Barnwell, South Carolina reported in their May 11 edition that the Southern Railroad had purchased the Carolina Midland, a main road that cut across the state. The Railroad had recently purchased the South Carolina and the Georgia road. The Railroad intended to use this road to construct a direct line from Columbia, SC to Savannah, GA. Cities like Barnwell paid close attention to the expansion of the railroad and to where the new lines would be placed because they stood to benefit greatly economically if the lines ran through their town. &lt;br /&gt;In their book, The American South: A History, authors William J. Cooper and Thomas E. Terrill state that by the 1890s the New South had contracted the railroad mania of the nineteenth century, and for good reasons'. Railroads offered the ability to traverse the difficult geography of the South, offering opportunities to expand trade and develop local economies into regional ones. Railroads fostered the spread of the cotton culture because it allowed farmers in more remote areas to transport their crop to a city center where it could be sold. According to the authors, while railroad mileage in the South doubled in the fifteen years between 1865 and 1880, the boom increased in the final two decades of the century with mileage tripling between 1880 and 1900.&lt;br /&gt;While railroads clearly offered many opportunities in the South, Cooper and Terrill argue that, by the 1890s, the result was too much of a good thing'. The low population density and the primarily agricultural economy made it difficult for companies to sustain profits throughout the year. Thus, while railroads benefited the South in many ways, it also made it economically vulnerable."],"display_date":"May 12, 1899","search_date":"1899-05-12","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":192,"title":"Announcement of North Carolina&#39;s First State Fair\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-06-29","end_date":"1853-06-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 29, 1853, the Raleigh Register published an announcement stating, We are pleased to learn that the first annual State Fair will be held in the city of Raleigh on the 18th of October next.

The cotton states of South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia would all fall far short of their usual quantity'.  Other crops suffered as well; in some areas of the South they could only produce barely a bushel of corn per acre.'

However, the failure of cotton this year did not force Southerners to find other means of prosperity; instead it made them even more committed to agriculture.  By feeling such a lean year, plantation owners began to realize just how dependent they were on cotton, and therefore had to find every way to protect its perseverance.  This fear would make them resistant to any sort of change in their system coming from outside influence (particularly Northern states and abolitionists).  It would lead some ardent leaders to reject any kind of compromise with the North and really feed to the sectional nature inherent for an impending Civil War.

The Massachusetts legislative committee on mercantile affairs heard the petitions of two cotton mills, Boott and Merrimac, to manufacture goods outside of the commonwealth.  The mills were created in 1835 for the manufacture of cotton goods in Lowell, goods designated for consummation and export.  At the end of the nineteenth century, competition arose from the cotton mills of the south as a result of cheaper fuel and labor.  The Boott mill claimed that if they were to continue to make the goods, they must make them where they have the same advantages as the southern companies.'  &lt;br /&gt;Historian Laurence Gross in his book, The Course of Industrial Decline: The Boott Cotton Mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, 1835-1955, says that the wages and conditions [at the mill] impaired both effort and effect' (78).  As conditions at the Lowell mill declined, workers, especially females, quit, causing the mill to turn to immigrant labor forces.  The immigrants would accept low wages, but many were unfamiliar with the technology at the mill and struggled to understand the English language.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Boott cotton mills never moved South (they collapsed for a period in 1905), they represent the erosion of the monopolization of the textile industry in New England begin to erode.

They debated a new tariff. This act would be a close relation to the Tariff of 1828, which was benevolently called the Tariff of Abominations. The new bill was a protectionist tariff, attempting to protect local producers from foreign competitors by setting the tariff on imported goods, or using some other method to reduce importation. But, it would not protect those domestic producers evenly. It benefited the textile industries in the North by forcing people to buy more domestic products. At the same time, it hindered southern cotton farmers, because the English textile industry couldn't buy as much cotton.With the debate raging, several southerners were wary of the coming effects. One wrote that the passage of this act could lead to resistance and the dissolution of this glorious Union. At the time, this seemed like a drastic opinion, but it proved somewhat prophetically. On July 14, 1832, Andrew Jackson approved the bill that had passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The duties were to go in effect on March 3, 1833. The debate did not end with the passage of the tariff. The southern states, as expected, were upset; and South Carolina in particular would take a harsh line against the government, hinting at their initiation of a later secession from the Union. South Carolina set off the Nullification Crisis by declaring the tariff null and void in the winter of 1832. Most states did not agree with South Carolina's drastic action, but the issue of states' rights was laid on the table for the first time.

Grangers around the United States began calling for railroad regulation to lower crop freight rates in addition to negotiating better credit rates with local merchants and combating falling crop prices.  One local example of the incredible growth the Grangers experienced was in Tennessee.  On July 2, 1873, representatives from 40 local granges convened to form a Tennessee-wide grange and elect a Worthy Master of the State Grange.  By November of that year, there were 215 local granges, and by May of 1874 the total was 823.  Meanwhile, regional attempts at coordination also began to emerge, including interstate connections and communications among granges.  In August of the year, well before the Panic had begun, the Atlanta Constitution published a substantial article describing the rise of the Farmers' Movement as absolutely astonishing, and without precedent for rapidity of growth;in no part of the country is the movement gathering strength faster than in the cotton belt.'  With agriculture already a powerful legislative force in Western states like Illinois and Kansas, the agrarian South during the summer of 1873 was a veritable powder keg of potential political power; the disastrous events of September 18 simply provided the flashpoint which ignited it.&lt;br /&gt;It has always been said that the agricultural interests of the country [are] the slowest to move, or to change, but when they do once start, the movement is steady, strong, and irresistible.' These words, written by a Constitution staffer in August, proved prophetic after the Panic of 1873 hit.  The Grange Movement gained a new urgency as crop prices began a precipitous five-year decline; the price of cotton was slashed by nearly fifty percent between July and December.  Adding to farmers' woes was the steady deflation which accompanied falling prices.  Deflation (caused by a shortage of gold to back currency) meant that farmers' debts were becoming more expensive as their crops were bringing in less revenue, which made for a dire situation indeed.  The secretary of the Georgia State Grange telegraphed an open invitation to Patrons of Husbandry and farmers generally of the Cotton States' to a mass Granger meeting in Atlanta on November 25, 1873 to devise and consider measures looking for relief of prevailing distress.'  Nationally, Grange membership peaked in 1875 at 250,000.  The popularity and political power of the Granger Movement, fueled by the severity of farmers' financial situations, lead to the passage of Granger Laws' regulating railroads, as well as laying the foundation for the Populist movement and Greenback Party of the late 1880s and 1890s."],"display_date":"July 2, 1873 - December 31, 1896","search_date":"1885-04-01","locations":[{"id":11955,"lat":36.1695702654,"lng":-86.7859142705,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":324,"title":"Crop lien system &#40;sharecropping&#41; entrenches itself in former plantation areas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-29","end_date":"1873-10-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As a result of the costs of rebuilding after the Civil War and the depression during the 1870s, many farmers saw falling production and prices for their crops, with cotton dropping nearly fifty percent between 1872 and 1877.  Other crops formerly produced by slave labor (tobacco, sugar, and rice) also saw steep declines in their prices.  In the heavily agricultural South, especially Black Belt and coastal plantation regions, falling crop prices meant that smaller farmers' credit dried up with their profits, while medium- and large-scale farmers struggled to turn a profit and pay their employees.  Unable to meet their debts, many were forced to sell their land in assignee's sales or had it seized by banks, only to be bought by the same large landowners that had owned slaves before the war.  One such man was Edmund Richardson (Willis p. 13), who bought up seized property along the Mississippi River during Reconstruction until he owned cotton plantations' in 4 different Mississippi Delta counties, with a headquarters' in Washington County; Richardson's land produced over 100,000 bales of cotton per year.  &lt;br /&gt;To work these vast tracts, many former slave owners initially employed black squad labor for cash wages, a system which did not last long.  In the words of the New York Times' correspondent in coastal Jacksonville, Florida, When the war ended, the negroes were without homes.  The old planters owned all the finest lands in the state; They made the best contracts they could with the freedmen to raise their cotton crops [but] the planters had no means, and could scarcely restock their estates, depleted after the war.' Pricey post-Civil War rebuilding, the Panic, and competition for workers in heavily black agricultural areas like the Mississippi Delta and the heaviest cotton counties in the State [of Florida],' made squad-labor prohibitively expensive, forcing planters to find a middle way between squad labor and autonomous black production.' (Willis 33)  Sharecropping seemed to be a good compromise for whites because it maintained the prewar social power structure by keeping blacks dependent on the white elite for land, tools, and credit while simultaneously maximizing crop output by giving workers a financial incentive to produce.  The crop-lien system of agriculture was particularly widespread in the Deep South belt stretching from Louisiana to South Carolina, lasting from Reconstruction until the mechanization of agriculture and industrialization of the New Deal and World War II."],"display_date":"October 29, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-29","locations":[{"id":1328,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":329,"title":"Passage of the Hawaiian Treaty Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-08-14","end_date":"1876-08-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Concurrent resolutions of the Hawaiian Treaty bill passed both houses in mid-August of 1876.

Benjamin, however, was able to regain much of his prosperity in the ensuing years.  Determined to , in his own words , overthrow an aristocracy which had come down to us from colonial days', he mounted a campaign in the 1880s to foment discontent amongst the agricultural community within South Carolina with the ruling agricultural political establishment.  Championing diversification and agricultural education, he was one of the founders of the Edgefield Agricultural Society in 1885.  &lt;br /&gt;However, it was the decision by Francis W. Dawson, the Editor of the News and Courier, to publish several of Tillman's letters in his newspaper in November of 1885 which dramatically increased his notoriety and popularity around the state.  In these letters he made a forceful case for increased agricultural education in South Carolina.  Praising the agricultural-specific colleges of Michigan, Kansas, and Mississippi, Tillman decried the pitiful, contemptible, so-called agricultural annex' at the South Carolina College in Columbia.  Claiming a desperate need for additional scientific training in agriculture within the state, he pointed to the distinct agricultural character of the state's populace , three-fourths of which are farmers -- as evidence that less of the farmer's money' should be used to fund the study of the professional arts.  Tillman proposed that the state legislature use the interest it had earned off the 30,000 acres appropriated to it by Congress in 1862 , roughly 11,520 , to finance such an agricultural institution as is found in the aforementioned states.&lt;br /&gt;In a later letter, Tillman delivered a stirring indictment of the institutions set up to support agricultural interests within the state of South Carolina , namely, the Board of Agriculture, the State Agricultural Society, and the College of South Carolina.  He intricately described a Board dominated by non-farmers uninterested in furthering agricultural progress, an Agricultural Society whose noble intentions are marred by bureaucratization and partisanship, and a College barely devoted to inculcating agricultural knowledge amongst its student body .  He proposed that South Carolina hold annual farmer's conventions as they do in many Northern states, and advocated the formation of agricultural societies, fairs, and farmer's institutes.  Tillman ended his letter with a call to the farmers of South Carolina to organize and push such reforms, and pleaded that the prosperity of the state is intimately tied to their implementation, especially that of agricultural education.&lt;br /&gt;Often depicted as a populist,' Tillman went on to serve both as governor and United States senator for the state of South Carolina, where he became , once again, in his own words , the most powerful political factor in South Carolina.'"],"display_date":"November 19, 1885","search_date":"1885-11-19","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":463,"title":"Thirty-eight Sheriff Sales Reported in Local Missouri Newspaper\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-02","end_date":"1890-02-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many Missouri farmers lost their farms in sheriff's sales during 1890.

Upon Congressman Venable's requests, Congressman McKinley ensured that no more reductions in the tobacco would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many southerners believed that the farmers shouldered the burden from increased tariffs while manufacturers prospered from the increased rate.  The Atlanta Constitution attempted to stir up opposition to the tariff bill by calling the legislation the robber tariff bill' and presenting a specific instance of harm to farmers.  The McKinley bill provided for a tax increase from two dollars to two and a half dollars on every ton of manufactured fertilizer used by United States farmers.  The United States only imports a small amount fertilizer; therefore, according to the newspaper, manufacturers benefit greatly from this provision.  The Atlanta Constitution also stated that the proposed enormous increase of duties on guns, cutlery, glassware, and pottery, we are fact to face with a business question, and politics and sectionalism should have nothing to do with it.'"],"display_date":"January 1, 1890 - May 30, 1890","search_date":"1890-03-16","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":478,"title":"Debate over Sherman Anti-Trust Act and Sherman Silver Purchase Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Sherman Anti-Trust Act represented the first action by the federal government to curb business monopolies.

Increasing railroad rates, along with other economic hardships throughout the eighties, pushed citizens to ask for more government control over corporations in general, but the railroads especially. Although Governor John Young Brown refused to sign the bill he found too strict,' the bill was passed, outlawing extortion by the railroad. Investigations, court trials, and fines were all possible punishments to a railroad corporation suspected of or found guilty of extortion. For the next seven years, Kentucky legislators fought a fierce battle over railroad regulations. &lt;br /&gt;William Goebel, a Democratic Kentucky Senator, was well-known all over Kentucky for fighting for the common man. After Republican Governor Bradley was elected in 1895, Goebel, then a Senator, realized the discontent among the economically-separated Kentucky Democrats and stood up as their leader. When the McChord Bill, a very strict and thorough bill to control railroad activities, was submitted to Congress in 1898, Goebel was a strong supporter. However, Republican control of the assembly led the bill to be vetoed. In January of 1900, after Goebel had won the election for Governor of Kentucky, Goebel re-introduced the McChord Bill into the Democrat-controlled Senate. By March of 1900, the McChord Bill, lessening the railroads' control over the common man of Kentucky, became a law. On January 1, 1900, as William Goebel was making his way to the state capitol office building along with 2 other politicians, a gunshot was fired and Goebel fell to the ground. Five days later, he was dead. Goebel was assassinated only six weeks before the McChord Bill was enacted. &lt;br /&gt;The McChord Bill was quite a controversial piece of legislation in Kentucky according to the Louisville Courier-Journal, stating that no other measure before the General Assembly for many years past has been so bitterly and persistently opposed by corporate influences' (1). Until this point, railroads had possessed the power to charge their customers whatever rates they pleased and to change those rates at any time because railroads were the most efficient way to travel for most people. The McChord Bill put a strict control on railroads and the money they were to make for the first time. Railroad owners had reason not to be pleased with this control."],"display_date":"April 5, 1893","search_date":"1893-04-05","locations":[{"id":4829,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":748,"title":"Drought drives up grain prices\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-12-02","end_date":"1817-12-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Drought and famine struck most of the Western world in 1816, and continued throughout 1817.  In 1817, grain prices were 154% of the price in 1815 in the United States.  In the month of January, the price of grain was nearly twice the original 1815 price.  This was partially due to a low grain harvest in America, but also reflected the large amount of grain exported to Europe, where the famine was much worse.  The season of the fall of 1817 saw grain supplies returning to their pre-drought levels.  On September 5th, 1817, the Richmond Enquirer noted the price of grain in France was down 5 francs, and that the price of grain was falling every where'.&lt;br /&gt;A letter from Saxony, Germany dated May 31st was printed in the Raleigh Minerva.  It blamed a stunted grain harvest for the widespread and severe famine in Germany that had been going on for years.  The Saxony man explained the economic toll the famine was taking.  Since people had so little money and food, they were unable to save up or store for the future.  Even after the famine ended, it would be hard for the town to return to it's previous economic independence.  In contrast, the grain producers of the southern United States were thriving on the increased demand for their produce outside of the country.&lt;br /&gt;The Milledgeville Republican of Georgia reprinted an article from London expressing a worry that they were importing too much grain from the United States.  London imported over a million barrels of flour from the United States in 1817.  This amounted to about three million pounds sterling paid to the U.S. for grain in that year.

After the end of the Civil War, Texas cattle ranchers began shipping their calves to markets in the north to be sold. Northern ranchers began to realize, however, that whenever the southern' cattle, cattle raised in pre-Civil War slave states, came into contact with northern cattle, disease broke out among the northern cattle within a few weeks, killing almost every animal afflicted. A letter to the editor of the Chicago Tribune in June of 1868 illustrates the fears of northern cattlemen, informing them that While at Centralia, yesterday, I saw a very long train of stock cars filled with Texas and Indiana oxen on their way to Iroquois County . . . there were in the lot fourteen hundred head of old, worn-out oxen, bringing the Spanish fever with them. A writer in the Missouri Democrat has described this disease as contagious, and says that it causes the destruction of our home cattle wherever these Texas cattle are taken' (2). Blaming Texas cattle entirely for the problem, Midwestern states passed quarantine laws to keep Texas cattle from passing through their state lines in an effort to protect their herds from the fatal disease. By prohibiting Texas cattle from passing through their states, Midwesterners also got a hand up on the cattle market because Texans had to put more time and effort into finding new routes to where they needed to take their cattle.  &lt;br /&gt;Studies were done on the afflicted cattle and in 1893 Theobald Smith and Fred Lucius Kilborne published the results of their study on the Texas fever, conducted at the federal Bureau of Animal Industry. Smith and Kilbourne found that the disease was most likely caused by a parasite called Pyrosoma bigeminum, which lived in and killed red blood cells. They believed that the disease was likely spread by cattle ticks, a theory previous medical men had dismissed as absurd. Smith and Kilbourne went on to differentiate between two different types of the disease, as well as to conclude that southern cattle acquired immunities to the disease early in life and, therefore, were not affected. &lt;br /&gt;The coincidence of the border of slave and free states being the same as the border between cattle afflicted by the disease and cattle not afflicted by the disease caused many northerners in the antebellum period to blame the southern lifestyle as the cause of their diseased cattle. Smith and Kilbourne's research helped to displace this false theory in the late 1800's, and thus help displace northern and southern stereotypes that may be made today."],"display_date":"June 1893","search_date":"1893-06-15","locations":[{"id":14347,"lat":36.7220692336,"lng":-81.9642215133,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":754,"title":"&#147;Whitecapping&#39; becomes serious issue in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-04-14","end_date":"1893-04-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 14, 1893, farmers in Lincoln County, Mississippi were arrested and put in jail for acts of whitecapping against other African American farmers. Whitecapping in Mississippi specifically refers to using violent tactics to force African American farmers to leave their farm land and their homes. Farmers living in poverty because of widespread agricultural problems were usually the culprits of this type of violence. When a farmer was forced to give up his land because of too much debt, local merchants acquired the land and often hired African-Americans to farm the land. Poor white farmers were angered by the fact that African-Americans were farming the land that another white farmer had been forced to give up and they took out their anger on the African-Americans by using whatever means they had to force them to leave. &lt;br /&gt;The issue came to a head on May 5, 1893 when over a hundred white farmers interrupted the proceedings of the court in Jackson, Mississippi by surrounding the courthouse, pistols in hand. The presiding judge, Judge Chrisman, left the courthouse and fearlessly denounced them and ordered their arrest' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution. The whitecaps soon retreated, upon arrival of another posse of armed citizens raised by Judge Chrisman. After their retreat, the governor of Mississippi arrived with a military company to insure that the whitecaps didn't try another attack later that night.  &lt;br /&gt;The whitecaps taking part in the siege on the Jackson courthouse claimed their actions were meant as a dispute against their fellow imprisoned whitecaps being denied bail. However, the acts the imprisoned whitecaps were arrested for were acts of arson on buildings inhabited by humans, acts which were not allowed bail in Mississippi at the time. Local citizens were outraged at the nerve of the men who thought they could overrule the law with intimidation and violence. The good citizens of the county are aroused, and publicly denounce the actions of the sympathizers of the prisoners' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution.

Water and boats were the only adequate forms of transportation and ultimately trade. As a cycle of reinforcement, water transport promoted trade and trade promoted water transport. Soon, with the implementation of newer materials, lighter resources and fresher ideas, boats become better and faster then before. Access to a body of water was so necessary to means of living in the 18th Century that the upper class would buy isolated houses on the water front. As long as they had access to water they did not need neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;Soon thereafter railways and trains were built and a new industrialized form of trade emerged into the South. Railroads soon became another medium of trade, though not as reliable or as fast as one would have liked. The greatness of employing trains, however, meant that resources and commodities could be found and transported to places within the states that were not on or near a body of water. In 1844, iron was implemented for both railroads and underground railroads. Southern States that bordered water, had previously relied on steam boats and water for essential transportation needs. Now, they had a fast and reliable alternate form of transport. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads provided for more unity within the states, whereby people could travel across the country for leisure. It also provided an accessible method for transporting goods and commodities for trade, such as bringing sugar from the south up to the north, which boosted the economy. This improvement also enhanced the infrastructure of America. More importantly though, the railroads were now an easier way for slaves to escape their masters and oppressed lifestyles. Blacks knew that if they made it to the North or Canada, help awaited them. Underground railroads began to flourish all over the country.

The Company intended to do this by repairing and enlarging the old canal. The capacity of the water-power was to be around 7,000 horse-power, and as a result there would be 3,500 horse-power on both sides of the river. On August 30, 1882, a crowd gathered to see the head gates opened to allow ten feet of water to flow into the forty-foot canal. Local press observed that the water power was sufficient and would be able to run all the factories on the canal. This would then hopefully provide Danville with its long-desired' prosperity and happiness of a first-class southern manufacturing center.' Furthermore, in late September, the State noted the improvements at Danville, specifically the cotton factories and machinery, could be enumerated at around 25,000, including the costs of the improvement of water power."],"display_date":"June 10, 1882 - August 30, 1882","search_date":"1882-07-20","locations":[{"id":14155,"lat":36.8111162856,"lng":-79.3976134371,"zoom":9,"place":"PITTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1358,"title":"Northwestern region of Virginia breaks away from the state\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-01","end_date":"1861-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Although Virginia decided to secede from the Union, the northwestern counties of the Allegheny region had different beliefs about the state's actions.  Three out of every four voters were against the secession.  As tensions mounted with the parent state, northern counties formed their own state and broke away from Virginia, allowing them to remain loyal to the Union.  The issue of the discontentment among Virginians arose in the state convention.  The secession of Western Virginia from Eastern Virginia in the event of the secession of the latter from the United States is openly evident in the State Convention at Richmond.  And evidently the threat is not an empty one.'  (The Louisville Daily Journal, April 19, 1861, p. 3)  One of these counties was Allegheny County.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;          Residents in this region were mainly non-slave holding, subsistence farmers who did not wish to be dragged into the war.  They did not agree with Virginia's desire to maintain slavery as a rightful institution.  By aligning with the Union, northwest Virginians felt protected, but could foresee doom in a nation that war was inevitable.  A foreboding speech by a man named Mr. Webster in 1851 was delivered in Washington, D.C. and later recalled by a Louisville reporter.  He in part stated, And ye men of Western Virginia, who occupy the slope from the top of the Alleghenies to Ohio and Kentucky, what benefit do you propose to yourselves by disunion?  What man in his senses can suppose that you would remain part and parcel of Virginia a month after Virginia had ceased to be a part and parcel of the United States?

The Knights of Labor refused to accept this offer and the great strike' began on March 14, 1882. Edward Ayers explains that the Knights of Labor fought to gain better wages, hours, and working conditions.' The Knights furthermore attacked the concentrations of power and monopolies that dominated the economy. Workers often sought the support of their local Knights of Labor organization to aid them when needed. &lt;br /&gt;On August 22, 1882, the District Assembly and the Knights of Labor had a long session in Frostburg. The companies, however, did not change their terms that had been given at the Cumberland conference. As a result, the following notice was ordered to be posted: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all Whom it May Concern: The 24th of August, 1882, we, the undersigned, have decided to resume work. All parties are hereby noticed to apply at their respective places of working at 7 A.M. for their tools.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This notice was signed by the Knights of Labor and dated August 22. This signing ended the greatest strike the Cumberland region [had] ever known.' The estimated money loss to the miners and the people was 1,500,000. &lt;br /&gt;The State explained that almost all the old workers would find work, although new workers would not be turned away only if they wished to remain. All the workers, however, were to conform to the rules of the companies instead of those of their organization.' The State on August 30 explained that now that the labor strikes that had affected industrial centers across the States were ended, the Knights of Labor had to begin to realize that they [were] the losers.' The article reported that, indeed, in some cases the organization was successful in obtaining an increase of wages, but almost all the strikers had to continue working under the old wages and the loss of the laborers amounted hundreds of thousands of dollars.' The State stressed that the failure of the strikes were a result of the bad timing of the strikes. At that time, the employers were considering cutting wages because of a general dullness of business and a gloomy outlook for summer trade.'

By 1830, prices had bottomed out in at 9 cents per pound, and Southerners searching for the cause narrowed in on Federal tariffs, specifically the Tariff of 1828. Newspapers such as the Charleston Mercury on August 3 argued that the tariff resulted in the annihilation of commerce' which would of necessity produce an annihilation of our means of naval defense' as well. This perception of the effects of the Tariff, though controversial, is what most impacted the Southern political identity, especially in South Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight of the argument came with Congressman George McDuffie of South Carolina's 40 Bale Theory, which argued that a 40% tariff on imported finished cotton good resulted in a 40% increase in price to consumers. He thought that this in turn caused a 40% decrease in US sales of imported finished cotton good, which meant a 40% decrease in the demand for raw cotton abroad and thus a 40% decrease in income for planters. In an April 26, 1830, speech before the House of Representatives, reprinted in the Richmond Enquirer on June 1, McDuffie asks for the same reason, therefore, that a duty upon the exports of cotton cannot raise the price of that cotton in the British markets, a duty upon the imports of British merchandise cannot depress the price of that merchandise in those markets?' In other words, the American tariff can only hurt Americans. It does nothing to effect Britain's sale prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 40 Bale perception, therefore, means that although the restrictive federal tariff may protect U.S. industry to some degree, it directly hurts U.S. planters and consumers as a whole -- an idea that is based in what is now known to be economic reality. In addition, though, the Tariff was a major part of the Federal tax income, an income which Congress was attempting to spend on controversial internal improvements such as roads and canals. This, then, only helped fuel anger over the Tariff and what from hindsight can be seen as the growing sectional debate over the proper role of the Federal government."],"display_date":"April 6, 1830","search_date":"1830-04-06","locations":[{"id":11653,"lat":33.8522812111,"lng":-80.2797613977,"zoom":8,"place":"SUMTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1477,"title":"Hatch Act of 1887\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-03-02","end_date":"1887-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During and after the Civil War, many farms and ranches were without the man power needed to cultivate the land.  William Henry Hatch of Missouri joined forces with Norman J. Coleman to create legislation that would promote all aspects of agriculture.  The Martinsburg Gazette reported that President Grover Cleveland approved the famous Hatch Act on March, 2 1887,' which created agricultural experiment stations in each state.  At these experiment stations, scientists worked with farmers, ranchers, suppliers, and processors to promote better food production at faster rates.  Also, the bill created an executive department to be known as the Department of Agriculture and Labor.  One of [the amendments] provides for the transfer of the Bureau of Labor to the proposed new department,' stated the Martinsburg Gazette.  After the agriculture department received cabinet status, weekly bulletins were issued to farmers free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;Before the Morrill Act of 1862, little attention had been given to education as a means of developing better agricultural methods,' describes McReynolds about the effects of the Hatch Act, but by 1900, schools began adopting agriculture in their curricula.  This helped spread agricultural knowledge to the younger generations and assisted current farmers with new techniques and machines as the farming industry rapidly grew.  Campbell expresses how the stations stimulated agricultural growth in Texas by saying, The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, established in 1887, researched every aspect of agriculture in [Texas] in an effort to increase production, lower costs, and expand markets.'  As a result of combining and expanding the agriculture industry, many people no longer had to live in poverty or eat meagerly because American agriculture had been revolutionized.

The letters, sent by a number of farmers expressed concerns over the delay of the railroad construction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farmers worried over two possible delays. The first resulted from the recent state appropriation of 500,000 to the building of the railroad. As a condition for the money, the Tennessee General Assembly appointed new Directors for the Railroad Company. Farmers worried the new Directors would cause disruption, and delay construction. Financial provision for the railroad created the second problem. The farmers recognised that Tennessee suffered from an economic depression, like many ex-Confederate states, yet urged that the line be completed before the harvest of 1867. Although the state had appropriated money, not enough had been provided to complete the line in time. The farmers urged the state Directors to postpone the building of machine shops, so that the 20,000 could be used to finish the railroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farmers' concern for the railroad construction came from their livelihoods' dependence on the railroad. It connected them to the markets in the big consumer centres across the United States, especially to the large consumer population on the East coast. If the railroad remained incomplete by harvest their crops would not be sold, but wasted, and their chances of provision lost. The worries of the farmers further reflected the importance of the railroad, which began to experience a post-war boom, continuing until 1916. It opened up further land that had been inaccessible, due to the lack of transportation for goods, for agricultural use. Farmers in these areas depended on the railroad to make a living, for without it they could not send their produces to be sold."],"display_date":"April 9, 1867 - May 1, 1867","search_date":"1867-04-20","locations":[{"id":12156,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1517,"title":"Fruit Workers End Strike\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-04-01","end_date":"1881-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Laborers on fruit farms near Chattanooga received a pay raise to 5.50 per ton after striking for two months.

The Knights of Labor, for one, did not necessarily present an innovative response to the problems of industrial America,' but rather a continuation of the antebellum reform trend,' according to historian Melton McLaurin.  They sought to return laborers to the proprietary status' they held previously.&lt;br /&gt;Though Knights of Labor leaders generally opposed strikes, Southern locals frequently ignored this policy, which McLaurin argues contributed to the ultimate demise of the organization.

During the hearings, inquiries of the expediency by which private legal owners would be repaid for their private property were made, and decided upon that such property would be repaid as soon as possible thereafter.  The bill coincided with other legislation that prevented farmers from exporting crops, except in cases only when in exchange for articles essential to war.  Additional bills were further proposed implying that the Confederacy should simply buy all cotton and crops from the farmers of the South to prevent the minutiae of retribution following the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By formally creating a bill, the Confederate Congress legalized and made it possible to regulate the destruction of property, upon military necessity, that had already been occurring in townships and counties across the South.  By destroying abandoned and/or defeated land, the South made sure victories for the North would not result in any agricultural or resource gain, simply a wartime victory with the possible gain of a few muskets and cannons here and there.  This also calmed the concerns of farmers in the South who sought a formal agreement outlining the terms in which they would be repaid.

By these rules, a contract for the labor in question had to be produced in writing and given to an agent of the Bureau. It was also stated that, The employer will stipulate to provide good and sufficient food, quarters, and medical attendance for the entire family...' The contract made between Bath and Littlepage deviated quite significantly from these regulations. In their agreement, Littlepage agreed to farm part of Bath's land in shares in return for one half the cotton and one third of the corn raised. In the contract, Littlepage was required to supply his own mule, do all of the woodwork on the plows and pay for one half of the cotton, potato and pea seeds. Bath took no responsibility for the health and welfare of Littlepage's wife and children, the contract dictating that Littlepage had to pay for all his family's doctor visits.&lt;br /&gt;Although not important on the national, regional, or even state scale, the contract serves as a valuable example of the economic options open to African-Americans in the South.

The constitution detailed opening stores for the benefit of Alliance trading members, holding stock in the company, and the company's organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the country, Farmers' Alliance groups established similar local cooperative stores, factories, bargaining groups with other merchants and other arrangements designed to benefit agricultural interests.

In the election of 1884, Republicans anticipated that their nominee, noted Ohio Congressman James Blaine, would be the next president. However, Blaine's reputation as a corrupt politician led a group of moderate Republicans, the Mugwumps, to splinter and side with Cleveland. On Election Day 1884, the Mugwumps were credited with giving Cleveland the slim majority he needed for victory. Four years later, however, the Mugwumps were much smaller in number. Moreover, in February, Cleveland refused to sign a Civil Service Bill, a move that hurt his image as an honest, dutiful politician and dismayed many of the remaining Mugwumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 5, Democrats from around the country convened at the Exposition Building in St. Louis. Cleveland was nominated unanimously for President, the first candidate to do so since 1840. Delegates from the convention tabbed Ohioan Allan Thurman as Cleveland's running mate. During the convention, the party decided to take a strong line against tariffs, an issue that had divided the country for nearly a century. Southern states across the board saw tariffs as detrimental to their predominately agricultural economies. Tariffs acted as barriers to free trade, lowering the international market demand for the South's products. In committing himself to reducing tariffs, Cleveland nonetheless put himself at risk. Although every former slave state firmly supported him, the decision further eroded Mugwump support. Indeed, he was in a perilous position with regard to the Mid-Atlantic States, with New York in particular."],"display_date":"June 5, 1888 - June 7, 1888","search_date":"1888-06-06","locations":[{"id":7920,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1575,"title":"Georgia Farmers Alliance issues a boycott on jute and the sale or cotton\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-08-21","end_date":"1888-08-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In July of 1888 the price of jute an important ingredient to the production of cotton jumped .42 cents per bail.

St Louis led the jute manufacturers to jointly raise the price.  In Georgia the Farmer's Alliance issued a resolution to boycott jute and to refuse to sell cotton until prices came down and this resolution was echoed by Farmer's Alliances throughout the southern states.  Southern congressional delegates were unable to fix the problem from Washington, so the farmers looked for a jute substitute in earnest.  A campaign was implemented in 1889 to use cotton wrapping, and although the south did not convert to cotton bailing the threat caused the jute trust to lose its dominance on the market and jute prices to drop.&lt;br /&gt;Mississippi and western Tennessee both had similar meetings of farmers and agreements to look for jute substitutes.

An outgrowth of the Grange Movement, the Alliance endeavored to solve the economic woes of the agricultural community through collective action, with the ultimate object of having their products marketed at more profitable prices.  Nevertheless, membership in the early years was surprisingly dismal.  However, under the leadership of President W.L. Garvin and his colleague S.O. Daws, the Alliance was able to draw roughly 600 delegates to the 1885 convention, an increase of 300% from the previous year. At the convention, the Alliance mandated the establishment of trade committees throughout the region, empowered with the task of ensuring low prices for their supplies from local merchants in return for their patronage, as well as committees of correspondence charged with guaranteeing pooled sales of the farmers' commodities on certain business days.  &lt;br /&gt;In the convention which occurred next year at the same location, the delegates issued an even more set of seventeen demands , dubbed the Cleburne Demands' , including the uniform coinage of gold and silver, the state's recognition of trade unions, a more equitable lien law, state laws requiring that workers be paid on time and with cash and not scrip, the eradication of convict leasing, and a national convention of all labor organizations.  This platform proved to be quite divisive and almost permanently divided the convention, if it were not for the leadership of Charles W. Macune, who would go on to take a prominent role in the Alliance movement in the ensuing years.  Moreover, the platform he and the other delegates championed at the convention would help spread this movement throughout the South.&lt;br /&gt;Observation of the Constitution of the National's Farmer's Alliance, crafted in 1890, sheds a little bit more light on the principles that these organizations espoused and their administration on the national scale.  The document states broadly that it intends to promote the education of the agricultural class, prosperity for what it calls the toiling masses,' proper compensation for labor, and a just exchange of agricultural commodities.  Although it does craft a tripartite separation of powers within its national government much like the actual federal Constitution, it more significantly details the relationship between the national organization and its counterparts in the states.  Qualifications for being chartered as a state organization included having seven participating county organizations, having a distinct and non-conflicting constitution of their own, and acknowledging the supremacy of the national organization and its constitution.  Similar to the Tenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, the document mandates that all powers not explicitly given to the National Alliance would be reserved for the states' individual organizations."],"display_date":"August 4, 1885","search_date":"1885-08-04","locations":[{"id":12918,"lat":32.3790149365,"lng":-97.3663344715,"zoom":9,"place":"JOHNSON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1588,"title":"Cowford &#40;Jacksonville&#41; Formally Becomes US Territory\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-12-01","end_date":"1820-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Following the War of 1812, Isaiah D. Hart was living on a farm near the St. Mary's River in Florida.  Learning of the early successes of some small stores opened by white settlers near the Ferry Crossing on the St. John's River, Hart envisioned great potential for the area.  Making perhaps the most profitable decision of his life, in late 1820 Hart purchased what was then known as Cowford from settler L.Z. Hogans, trading cattle for the 18 acres of land.  At the time of Hart's acquisition, the population of Florida, without counting Native-Americans, did not exceed 12,000.   &lt;br /&gt;Because the Floridas were of interest to many other Southerners as well as Hart, Georgia's Southern Recorder provided a thorough description of the territory in an August 15, 1820 article.  The editor gave a precise explanation of the size and location of Florida for the many readers without access to a map or any other geographical background.  The Recorder primarily discussed the two major cities in Florida at the time, Pensacola and St. Augustine, but the article also went into detail about the agricultural advantages offered by Florida as a whole.  Although the soil was sandy, near rivers and lakes planters produced sugar, cotton, potatoes, corn, indigo, groundpeas, melons, plums, and many other goods.  Settlers found immense red and white oaks;mulberry, hickory, sassafras,' and typical animals such as horses, sheep, goats, cattle and swine, and in the deserts, otters, hares, rabbits, raccoons, and foxes (Southern Recorder).' &lt;br /&gt;The opportunity for economic growth in the Floridas, described by this and many other newspapers, provided the incentive for Hart's investment in Cowford.  The town lay in a valuable location in the northeast part of the territory and near a few bodies of water.  Hart built a boardinghouse and store, which soon became the heart of Jacksonville and made him a wealthy merchant and planter.  The city was incorporated in 1832, and once Florida became a state in 1845, it served as an important port specifically for timber and cotton trades.  Additionally, it would serve as a base for Southern blockade runners in the Civil War."],"display_date":"December 1820","search_date":"1820-12-16","locations":[{"id":2389,"lat":33.3278783249,"lng":-84.5112380239,"zoom":7,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1611,"title":"John P.

This proclamation triggered deep resentment among cotton farmers in the South, who were already struggling because of the oppressive crop-lien system. Raising the price of an essential component to cotton-picking, the jute bag, was adding insult to injury. Farmers Alliances across the South saw the need for a regional convention, and organized one in Birmingham later that year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the convention, farmers discussed three major issues: the state of cotton manufacturing in the South, the need for a permanent organization representing agricultural interests (a predecessor to the Populist Party), and the use of cotton rather than jute bags. The convention produced few answers on the first two issues, which would be more clearly addressed in a convention in Augusta, Georgia the following year. However, the leaders of the convention did urge their fellow farmers to use cotton bags. Their determination to boycott jute eventually forced the jute manufacturers to back down in 1889, concluding one of the few significant victories for the early Populist movement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several politicians took advantage of the situation and expressed their support for the farmers' cause. Most prominent among these were Richard F. Kolb, a county commissioner. He distinguished himself as an advocate for cotton farmers, and the positive publicity gave him momentum for a run for the Governor's seat in 1890.

Also, he did research in which he developed commercial uses for many products, including peanuts, sweet potatoes, cotton and pecans. The Birmingham Herald published his ideas and the finding that the deep cultivation of the soil' would be beneficial for farming; however, in the article George Washington Carver was given no recognition.

The party grew from an alliance (The Farmers Alliance) during an agrarian revolt that rose after a collapse of agriculture prices in 1873. The Farmers Alliance primary objective was to promote collective economic action by farmers and began to gain momentum in the South and the Great Plains. However, they were not capable of achieving its goal due to collective economic action of richer and more powerful groups such as merchants, brokers and railroad companies.  &lt;br /&gt;In order to combat this issue, the Farmers Alliance created a new agenda in which their attention would be placed towards politics. In 1889-1890, members of the Farmers Alliance created the Populist Party which spread to almost every southern and Great Plains state by 1892.Their reason for forming the party was twofold: first, the alliance wanted to reform and new regulations in national politics. Their platform include demands for a graduated income tax, civil service reform, abolition of national banks, unlimited coinage of silver, and an eight hour work day. Secondly, the alliance was receiving minimal support from the Democratic and Republican parties who did not agree with their policies.  &lt;br /&gt;By mid 1892, the Populist Party reached its peak during their national convention. Although the Populist Party did not win the 1892 presidential election, it was still able to win four states as well as receive electoral votes from another two states.

Essentially, General Orders No. 69 held that every exempt and detailed agriculturists' (i.e. plantation farmers, mainly) was to provide 100 pounds of bacon, or at the options of the Government, its equivalent in pork, and 100 pounds nett. Beef for each able bodied slave on the plantation between the ages of 16 and 50 years.'  The order also directed that these agriculturists sell at fair price any marketable surplus of grain and other provisions on hand' to the government or directly to soldiers' families.&lt;br /&gt;Written in conjunction with this General Orders, this circular explicitly indicates that several southern planters paid but little respect to the obligations they had contracted,' namely provision of resources in exchange for exemption from service.  This unwillingness towards, as the order says, diligently employing in good faith his skill, capital and labor, exclusively in the production of grain and other provisions' indicates a potentially deep rift forming between wealthy slaveholding land-owners and the poor white farmers that were fighting in the trenches.  This suggestion seems substantiated by the circular's indication that these exempt agriculturist sought profit by becoming speculators in food and provisions' while others openly affirm that they do not mean to have any surplus' that year.&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at the conditions that Confederate soldiers faced during the war, it is often contended that a lack of arms, munitions, food, or other resources never contributed directly to a major defeat.  In fact, many prominent schools of thought argue that the Confederates did not quit fighting until they had been absolutely destroyed physically, economically, and morally.  The hatred many southerners had more to feel towards the Yankees and the profound embarrassment that they anticipated if they should lose were often enough to keep southerners on task no matter how dire circumstances may have seemed.

Rice posted an advertisement in <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> titled <em>Wool Wanted</em>. Rice claimed that cash will be paid for good, clean wool. In the expanding population of the early nineteenth century the demand for woolen cloth kept well ahead of its productive capacity. In response to the increased demand for wool, a boom in mill construction occurred across America. According to James A. Morris, southern mills had no advantage in raw wool production over the North. Instead, their competitive edge resulted from lower wages created by the presence of slavery that bolstered the economy. "," Virginians used four basic types of mills. According to Morris, in undershoot wheels water flowed against the bottom of the wheel. Undershot wheels depended upon the use of dam and a dependable stream volume. The overshot wheel used a flume or race that brought water against the top of the wheel. Breast wheels received water above the axis. Water set pitchback wheels into motion by running against the back of the wheel. Nature dictated where Virginians built their mills. Men constructed mills wherever a creek had a ten-foot drop or sufficient flow to sustain a dam or millrace. Most mills produced less than forty horsepower since power depended upon water flow multiplied by the height of the fall. Morris claims that mill owners most commonly used the high-breast design. Unless mills used a large wheel, only 60 percent of the streams power could be used. Water proved to be an unreliable source of power, mainly due to droughts and floods. As a result, wool production could not keep up with demand because the South did not have sufficient resources to produce the valuable commodity."," In addition, problems with the insufficient supply of wool resulted from a minimal supply of sheep. The increased market for vegetable and dairy products pushed sheep into grazing lands of the West. Americans used Merino sheep, the only breed of sheep present in America that produced quality wool. However, these sheep required a large amount of grazing land. The other types of sheep present in America in 1821 produced coarse wool that created undesirable, poor quality fabric. Problems also resulted from a lack of effective transportation to carry wool from grazing lands in the West back to cities in the South. The demand for wool exemplified a recurrent problem in the South at the time of Rice's advertisement; the South lacked a sufficient supply of resources to meet the demands of its growing population.

A Virginia newspaper, The Montgomery Messenger, shows great interest in the economic benefits of a more extensive merchant marine. In an article written on March 3, 1899, it cited the London Statist, claming that since the United States has developed its iron and steel industries, outlets for such products would be highly beneficial. The paper went on to affirm this, explaining that trade with other nations is only natural, and almost necessary in light of the country's growing industrialism. Thus, because naval vessels were the only way to reach countries on the other side of the ocean, more ships had to be built. The paper calls for the government to subsidize shipbuilding to a degree in order to put more American trading ships on the water."," The United States' iron output grew tremendously in the years following the Civil War and Reconstruction, specifically southern iron output. Over twenty years (1880-1900), southern iron output increased from 397,000 tons to close to 2 million tons. Thus, the interest Southerners may have had in building more ships with which to trade seems very reasonable, almost natural. The desire to enlarge the shipbuilding industry in the United States stemmed from the desire to put more American raw materials on a global scale in larger quantities, and the South with its rapidly growing industries was particularly interested in this. The South was a huge source of natural resources for the country, its goods ranging from timber, minerals, and of course, the many agricultural products that were produced in huge quantities during that time (cotton, grains, livestock goods, etc.). With a powerful merchant marine (and even more significantly, a Southern-based merchant marine) these myriad goods could be transported more efficiently and in larger quantities to any foreign buyer. The stronger merchant marine may even be beneficial during wartime, which it proved to be in World War I as the United States used the Europeans' war as a huge source of income. As money continued to pour into the South, the desire to expand its trade increased as well.","Date: March 3, 1899","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Agriculture, Economy, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, March 3, 1899.

Shapard's Richland Creek estate advertisement boldly read: That very desirable and Beautiful Farm. Shapard first ran the advertisement in Nashville on March 4, 1847, and by Saturday, March 27, 1847 it ran again in the classifieds of The Daily Union. Shapard wanted to sell his estate, and vividly described every aspect of it in his advertisement. The estate was not merely a house on a plot of land, but it was an elaborate and highly integrated plantation. W.B. Shapard recently finished constructing a new main building. Built of brick, the house contained nine rooms, two large passages with handsome stairways and was finished in the best of style. Besides the house itself, Shapard listed the many plantation amenities to be found on the estate. These included a kitchen, store rooms, smoke house, carriage house, negro houses, stable, cow houses, and a spring house. According to W.B. Shapard, his plantation typified a proper country residence. Shapard ornately described the intricate details of the interior of the main house and painted a picture of the countryside which surrounds it. In his advertisement, Shapard capitalized on the romanticism that accompanied the reputations of plantations through out the South. "," Plantations like Shapard's separated the middle region of Tennessee from the more mountainous regions in the east of Tennessee. To the east of Nashville, in places like Knox County, farms produced on a much lower scale than plantations in the middle region of Tennessee did. Farming families like the Gibb's of east Tennessee, produced grains, wool, and other food stuffs. They also raised several different types of livestock. Farms like the Gibb's could not compete with the production of the South's staple crops by large plantations. Farms surrounding Nashville and other regions of middle Tennessee produced tobacco in an amount that was four to six times greater than individual farms in other regions of Tennessee."," Plantations like W.B. Shapard's supported production of this magnitude. Running a plantation was in a sense like running a business. The difference became evident by the way plantation owners provided for their workers. Instead of receiving salaries, owners provided their slaves with food, clothing, and living quarters, such as those described by W.B. Shapard. Plantations like the one W.B.

Cocke, the owner of a large plantation in Fluvanna County, Virginia, was concerned about the security of one of his major investments, his crops.  On January 24, 1876 Cocke received a letter from a store in Richmond, Virginia; the author of the letter regretfully informed Cocke that the wheat received from Cocke's farm fell short of the desired weight.  At the time that Cocke received the letter, R. S. Dunn, Cocke's farm manager, directed the planting, harvesting, and sale of Cocke's crops.  Thus, Dunn bore the responsibility for this oversight.  The store manager admitted that it was obvious to him that the crop fell short the moment that he first saw the wheat.  A competent and knowledgeable manager should have known that the wheat was insufficient according to market standards.  Dr. Cocke was unaware of this problem until the store manager informed him by sending a letter.  Between Dr. Cocke's visits to his plantation, he relied on the reports of his farm manager as a means to remain informed of the status of his crops and livestock.  During the second half of the nineteenth century, a number of farmers in Central Virginia, like Cocke, employed laborers to work their fields; these laborers served as a constant concern to the farmers in Central Virginia who were hoping to profit from sales of wheat and corn.  ","The cooperative nature of farm production in Central Virginia during this period increased the vulnerability of landowners like Cocke who employed independent laborers.  After slavery was abolished, farmers in Virginia abandoned the use of severe physical punishments to influence the productivity of their workers.  Instead, farmers in Central Virginia during the late nineteenth century adopted a more precarious position, as they entered into business ventures with their hired independent laborers, who were seeking to make profits, as well.  These cooperative farming ventures assumed a variety of forms and rendered landowners, especially those who lived away from their farm land, more vulnerable to the vices and virtues of their employees.  In <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Edward Ayers asserts that absentee landowners were growing in number during this time period, especially in the older southern states, such as Virginia.   ","Landowners, such as Cocke, relied largely on other men, in the form of farm managers, laborers, renters, and sharecroppers, to help ensure that their dreams of profit became a reality.  Both James Holladay of Prospect Hill, Virginia and Dr. Cocke utilized hired laborers on their farms.  Farmers' dependence on the labor of hired employees, renters, and sharecroppers was not limited to Central Virginia.  Ayers explains that farmers throughout Virginia, as well as farmers in all southern states, utilized various forms of collaborative labor.  Ayers argues that agricultural work displayed innumerable permutations.  While some farmers in the South utilized daily laborers, other rented their land or allowed sharecroppers to work portions of their land.","Landowners in Central Virginia found that their economic welfare was linked to the agricultural knowledge, work ethic, and trustworthiness of the employees who ran their farms.  This arrangement created problems; managers who failed to cultivate the crops adequately or neglected to realize the shortcomings of a harvest, as a consequence of their lack of the agricultural knowledge, had good reason to emphasize the good news and successes of the farm while downplaying the bad news and failures when reporting to the landowners."],"display_date":"January 24, 1876","search_date":"1876-01-24","locations":[{"id":13822,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2009,"title":"Women in Central Virginia Take Action against Poverty\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-01-01","end_date":"1885-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In January of 1876, Hester Tomlin was a troubled woman.  Hester discovered that her husband, Harry Tomlin, Jr. had written a letter to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia in December of the previous year in which he asked to rent a tract of land on Cocke's plantation.  Hester felt impelled to interfere.  A month after Harry wrote the aforementioned letter, Hester wrote an additional note to Dr. Cocke in which she begged him to deny her husband the land.  Hester explained, I hate to see [Harry] undertake anything that will not bring in money. . .for we are very destitute.  Women of the Central Virginia in the 1870's and 1880's felt trepidation when they envisioned a life of poverty; therefore, women played an active role in maintaining or improving their family's welfare.","Hester Tomlin was not the only woman in Central Virginia who feared poverty.  On the contrary, poverty was a salient topic to women across the region, as they contemplated their marriages, both present and future.  On January 30, 1885, Fredericksburg's local paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed a story about a woman who chose to marry a wealthy man and secure her economic future instead of marrying the poor man whom she loved.  This story appeared on the front page of the Fredericksburg paper.  In the aftermath of the economic depression of the 1870's, the topic was salient to the women in Central Virginia.  ","Many women in Central Virginia struggled or failed in their attempts to prevent or end their family's battle with poverty.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she admitted, I am living now on the charity of others and must continue to do so unless I can help myself in some boarding deportment. . .  Hester and other women of the time considered allowing people to live in their home as boarders so that they could earn money.  Yet, as Edward Ayers explains in <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Women [in the South] found exceedingly few opportunities to earn money in the countryside.  However, those who lived in rural areas, such as the farming areas in Central Virginia, could aid in farm labor.  An advertisement in the Fredericksburg newspaper in 1886 requested a farmer with a wife who understands the dairy business to help with the labor. ","Women, like Hester, throughout Virginia and in other southern states improved the economic wellbeing of their families by using a variety of methods for making money during the late nineteenth century, according to Ayers.  Ayers explains that farm women of the late nineteenth century normally produced and mended all of their family members' clothing.  Some women sold items such as butter, eggs, milk, and honey in order help their families earn more money.  Others made a profit by serving as a midwife to neighboring women.  Ayers also describes the vital role that women played as teachers in their communities during this time period.  In fact, Ayers points out that the number of female teachers in the South doubled in the 1880's. ","In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Central Virginians recognized the active role of women like Hester who worked diligently to better their family's financial situation.  On January 28, 1887, the <em>Free Lance</em> of Fredericksburg printed an article entitled They Never Strike that commended women for their hard work.  Yet, secretive or more subtle actions these women undertook in order to secure their family's future were undoubtedly overlooked.

Holladay had worked hard to perfect the new silo he designed for his farm, but he wanted assurance from an expert that his silo needed no further improvements.  On October 28, 1887 Holladay wrote to Professor Elliot W. Stuart, an expert in agriculture at the University of Virginia, and inquired as to the soundness of the new silo and machine that would automatically fill the silo that he had developed.  Holladay explained, The increasing difficulty of obtaining reliable labour when needed led me to consider the practicability of substituting machinery for hand labour in this part of the operation of filling silos.  Like Holladay, a number of farmers in Central Virginia who struggled to maintain or increase their plantation's productivity utilized innovative tools which, in the words of Holladay, improved in the quality of eusilage and economized labour.  After the economic depression that occurred in the 1870's, men in Central Virginia whose primary source of income revolved around agricultural ventures explored new options that would allow them to reduce farm expenditures while retaining their land.","Other farmers in Central Virginia did not invent new farm machines but, instead, rented tracts of land to tenants as a means to increase the economic productivity of their plantations.  In <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Edward Ayers explains that status as a renter was viewed as a temporary station that was merely a rung on the agricultural ladder of economic success.  Those who entered into contracts as renters aspired to one day become independent landowners.  On July 18, 1875, in a letter addressed to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia, Thos J. Rowland of Richmond, Virginia inquired about the land that Dr. Cocke was hoping to rent.  Mr. Rowland proposed that he pay rent in the form of annual cash payments to Dr. Cocke in exchange for the usage of five hundred acres of his land.  In December of the same year, Mr. Harry B. Tomlin, Jr. wrote a similar letter to Dr. Cocke in which he too asked to rent a parcel of Dr. Cocke's land.  However, Tomlin offered to make part of his payment by relinquishing a portion of the crops he produced on the land to Dr. Cocke.  ","Some farmers in Central Virginia undoubtedly utilized both of these techniques for increasing their plantation's productivity.  Holladay, the plantation owner who designed the new type of silo, also received a letter from a prospective renter.  On December 5, 1884, Z. C. Daniel wrote to Holladay saying that he would either buy or rent a tract of his land because he was somewhat short for land to put in corn.  Mr. Holladay and other farmers of Central Virginia both rented their land and created new farm machines as a means of coping with the aftermath of the economic depression that occurred in the 1870's. ","In Southern Crossing, Edward Ayers describes the years following the economic depression by asserting, New technologies and techniques offered sudden hope to areas that had been passed over for centuries.  These new technologies offered hope not only to farmers like Holladay in Central Virginia, but also farmers in the other farming regions of Virginia and states of the South.  Dependable help was hard to maintain due to the abolition of slavery and the migration of laborers, according to Ayers.  Therefore, farmers needed to develop methods for increasing production while decreasing the number of laborers they utilized on their plantations.

Burruss on July 24, 1841, John W. Burruss asked, ...do we not dwell in constant danger, are we not standing, rather [lying] down - sleeping on a smothered - not extinguished - volcano? John W. Burruss was expressing his fear of slave revolt, a fear he shared with many southern plantation owners. In his letter Burruss described a discovered slave revolt in West Felicia Parish, Louisiana, not far from Burrus's own Mississippi plantation. An overseer had overheard slaves having a suspicious conversation in the fields. The slaves were whipped until they confessed to plotting an uprising and revealed the names of their co-conspirators. One of Burrus's slaves, Lewis Campbell, was accused of involvement in the conspiracy. Burrus seemed certain that Campbell was a key player in the development of the scheme. He assured his father that the proper authorities had taken Campbell and the other insurgents into custody."," Although the revolt was quashed, the community was left in a state of upheaval. After southern white citizens discovered news of the rebellion many immediately became aggressive, lashing out against their slaves, though not to the infliction of death. Burrus went on to note that the trial would take place in August. He remarked that though the turmoil surrounding this event would eventually calm, tensions would remain as plantation owners continued to feel the threat of revolution. Slavery had a strong presence throughout Mississippi, but it was particularly deep-rooted in the delta at this time. Whites had established plantations there long before the rest of the state. In territorial Mississippi, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, plantation owners viewed slavery as a necessary evil. Despite many restrictions on slaves, slave owners rarely enforced these strict regulations. However, attitudes toward slavery quickly began to shift. By the end of the 1830s, slavery was considered not only beneficial for the slaveholder, but also for the slave. The plantation system proved to be so profitable that plantation owners used any ideological means they could to justify slavery. In the 1830s the number of slaves in Mississippi grew exponentially. By 1840, there were more blacks than whites in the state. As attitudes toward slavery changed and the black population grew, slaveholders became increasingly frightened of revolt. "," A slave insurrection, such as the one John Burrus reported, not only threatened the lives of slave holders, but also their economic welfare and social power. The institution of slavery and the social system it created were essential to the wealth of the plantation owner. Southern whites had witnessed the violence against whites wrought by Nat Turner, a slave from Southampton, Virginia, in 1831. Other plots of revolt had also been discovered throughout the South. After these events slaveholders were continuously ready for slave rebellion. Knowing that he had everything to lose, Burrus surely feared that Lewis Campbell was another Nat Turner."],"display_date":"July 24, 1841","search_date":"1841-07-24","locations":[{"id":5781,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2021,"title":"Mass Slave Runaway from McIntosh, GA Plantation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Things were looking promising on Mr. Thomas' plantation, Peru, in 1850. He owned over 150 slaves and 15,000 acres, all of which produced great wealth in the form of cotton and other crops. Most of his slaves had been reared on his plantation alongside him and his son ten-year old son, Edward. Both father and son felt they were very good to their slaves and provided them with ample food, clothing, and housing. Their generosity was such that Master Thomas even allowed many of his slaves to own guns, boats, horses, and to raise their own crops to sell to others. The Thomas' felt they treated their slaves in a fatherly fashion and called them our people, feeling that the relations between master and slave could not have been better anywhere. Both masters and slaves even went to the same church on Sundays, although the enslaved people had to sit in the back and take Communion last. Young Master Edward felt particular kinship with some of the slaves, as he played with them and requested barbeques on the plantation that everyone enjoyed. In the eyes of the Thomas family, life could not have been better for everyone on the plantation during the planting time of 1850. ","However, this content feeling disappeared when the largest slave runaway in young Edward's memory occurred just before the crop planting of 1850. Immense amounts of cotton were due to be planted, and it was a time when the most hardworking slaves were needed. At this crucial time eight or ten of Mr. Thomas' best slaves ran away, along with several other slaves from neighboring plantations, numbering fifty or sixty in all. The whites in the neighborhood were very angry at the fact that the runaways fled to the woods and outlying areas, and were surviving by stealing crops and cattle at night. Mr. Thomas and Edward were most distressed because in addition to ruining the slave-crop ratio needed for the planting, when the slaves left they felt as if fifteen thousand dollars had taken wings to itself and gone. The neighborhood did not see the runaways as men trying to obtain their rightful freedom, but as outlaws and menaces that had to be caught. The neighbors searched on horseback and with hunting dogs, and actually saw the runaways steal a boat and flee further into the woods but could not stop them. After that, nothing more was heard of the runaways until the first of December. That night, they came back to the plantation, sought out young Edward, and told him to tell Master that they were come in here. Master Thomas did not proceed to beat them but instead said he wished them to hell and later hired them out to a railroad contractor for the rest of the winter.","The runaway from Peru Plantation was in no way an unprecedented event for Southern slave owners, and runaways occurred for various reasons across the South. The living conditions of Southern slaves varied. Many were driven from sunrise to sunset, beaten constantly, had little food and terrible housing, and were given virtually no free time. However, despite the harshness of the institution of slavery, some masters were more lenient. Many told themselves they had to be good to their slaves because they were obligated to watch out for them and care for them in a fatherly manner. Many owners in Georgia also gave their slaves rations of meat, instead of just meal and corn. Some, like Mr. Thomas, allowed the slaves free time, which many used to tend gardens and sell their crops, as the slaves on Peru plantation did. Many masters, such as Mr. Thomas did not require their slaves to work on the Sabbath. However, even when slaves were given some leniency, as they were on the Peru Plantation, their masters were foolish to believe that their slaves were satisfied and placated by their master's paternalism and provisions. ","One of the biggest outlets for slaves to express their dissatisfaction was to run away. When they hid out like the Peru slaves, and as many others did across the South, it hurt their masters monetarily and unsettled the white community. It reminded them that their slaves were not satisfied, even if it did not totally ruin their delusion of being good masters. Slaves that fled, often raided crops and joined with slaves from other plantations when running away. These characteristics of the McIntosh runaways were not unique. Another common factor in slave runaways is that the slaves often only left for a short amount of time and sometimes returned of their own accord as did Mr. Thomas' slaves. It was hard for slaves as far south as Georgia to make it all the way to a free state and it was also hard for them to hide in a community where people would recognize them. Often they returned to their masters' plantations and the most common form of punishment was either being beaten or sold. Mr. Thomas did this on a lesser scale by hiring them out for a season. However Mr. Thomas felt, it can be assumed he was surprised by the slaves running away since he thought they had such wonderful conditions and relations, but this was what most slaveholders across the South believed. The nature of the McIntosh runaway was typical and shared many trends with other slave runaways in the South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":2023,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC INTOSH, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2030,"title":"A Very Satisfactory Cotton Crop\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-11-27","end_date":"1857-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gustavus Henry believed that producing cotton could make him a wealthy man. On November 27, 1857, he wrote a letter to his wife stating that despite encountering troubles for the past month, the gin stands [had] been doing finely for the last five days. Gustavus described the recent production as delightful. He further said it was a beautiful thing that the lead pipe, which brought water from the lake, enabled him to power two gins at once. However, he wrote that the water power was not sufficient enough to drive his saw mill or corn mill at the same time as the gins. Gustavus's excitement continued when he exclaimed that no one here [would] do any better than [he would]. He had reasons to be happy. At the time he wrote this letter, the price for cotton was unprecedently high. Henry estimated that he would likely sell close to 200 bales on this occasion which, thanks to the high price of cotton, would bring in about 10,000."," The detail Gustavus provided about his farm and the description of the work completed depicted that of a typical Arkansas plantation. Agriculture dominated the economy in the antebellum South, and cotton was the main agricultural product in Arkansas. Gustavus devoted the majority of his letter to discussing the status of his cotton crop. As historian Dallas T. Herndon argues, people in Arkansas who had money to invest preferred to invest it in a cotton plantation rather than a factory. In the rural economy of Arkansas, it was more beneficial for a man like Gustavus to invest in agriculture instead of textiles. "," Nearly every time Gustavus mentioned his cotton crop, he got excited and commented on the high price of cotton in the market. Because of the extraordinarily high price of cotton, Gustavus anticipated making 10,000 by selling his 200 bales of cotton. This was the kind of return he expected when he built his plantation in Desha. There was great wealth available to those who grew cotton. The allurement of such wealth enticed many men like Gustavus to grow cotton which made the South one of the largest producers of cotton in the entire world. "," Gustavus attributed the success of his crop to the efficiency of his cotton gins. The cotton gin was not a new machine in 1857. Eli Whitney's invention to separate seeds from cotton fiber had been around for sixty years. However, Gustavus stressed the important role the cotton gin continued to play on his plantation. Although he did not specifically describe the nature of his cotton gins, it was likely that the gins he owned were large. He described a lead pipe that brought water from the lake to power the gins. The use of water power was usually reserved for cotton gins of considerable size. "," Gustavus again focused on his cotton gins in another letter sent to his wife a few weeks later. In this letter, Gustavus described how a fire had destroyed his cotton gins and he did not know if his insurance would repay him for his loss. Gustavus's devastated tone in this letter again reflected how instrumental cotton gins remained in agriculture, even sixty years after Whitney first made his invention."],"display_date":"November 27, 1857","search_date":"1857-11-27","locations":[{"id":548,"lat":33.8857804348,"lng":-91.3151620379,"zoom":9,"place":"DESHA, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2031,"title":"Erastus Brown Encounters Indians on His Way to Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-11-15","end_date":"1859-11-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Like many young, adventurous men in the nineteenth century, Erastus Brown decided to explore the new frontier of the United States. Upon returning home from a trip to Texas, he wrote a letter to his sister, Millie, asking her to accompany him on his next trip. In discussing his trip to Texas, Erastus described his encounter with the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw Indian Nations. He described the Cherokee people and remarked their land was the most lovely country [his] eyes ever beheld. He added that the Cherokee people seemed very well enlightened. However, Erastus did not think so highly of the Creeks. He considered the Creeks to be the most inferior of the three races. Erastus continued his focus on the Creeks, and gave a full account of the traditional Creek dance he witnessed. The Creeks gathered around a pole yelling, singing, and dancing in a manner that reminded [him] of the exact representation made in history of their 'war dances.' He remarked, Only the poor or inferior portions continued such dances. The superior Indian Nations [studied] the art of agriculture. "," Erastus Brown was not alone in wanting to travel to newly settled territories in the United States. In fact, historian Randolph Cambell titled his book, Gone to Texas, to represent the message that appeared on the doors of many abandoned homesteads across the southeastern United States in the mid-nineteenth century. While Erastus did not explicitly state his reasoning for going to Texas, Cambell offers many reasons why people from the southern United States felt comfortable leaving their homes for Texas. First, the U.S. Army established forts and explored the new lands, thus providing the stability needed for people to move into the new territory. Those who went to Texas wrote home about the opportunities the new territory offered -primarily cheap, rich land. Furthermore, like other new territories, slaveholders saw Texas as an opportunity to expand slavery. "," Although Brown did not mention the exact route he traveled on his way to and from Texas, it was likely he traveled through Oklahoma. He stated that he went through the Indian Nations: Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw. As historian Dallas T. Herndon states, the movement of Americans into the western frontier forced Native Americans to be relocated to reserves in Oklahoma and part of the Texas Panhandle."," Brown noticed the different effects that American expansion and the relocation of Indians had on the tribes he came across. He described the Creeks as being inferior compared to the other Indian Nations. The Creeks continued traditions and rituals from the past such as the war dance. Other superior Indian Nations, moved away from their traditions and [studied] the art of agriculture. Herndon states that the Choctaw - one of the Indian Nations that Erastus encountered - were the most skillful agriculturists of all the Southern tribes, cultivating a greater variety of crops and with better successes.

Cotton-picking was back-breaking work. Always in the past, though, slaves had worked the long hours in the sweltering heat. Slavery ended, but the demand for labor did not. Suddenly the planters had the job of enticing labor that had been so simple, if expensive, to secure just years earlier. They began to question just where that easy labor had gone.","The Milledgeville Southern Recorder addressed just this question in early 1869, at the same time revealing a great deal about white attitudes. Some whites, the Recorder begins, blame the mysterious absence of black labor on the railroads. The paper counters that this is only a partial truth. The greater drain, it insists, is the great number of black families who have a self satisfied confidence in their ability to run a farm of their own, thinking they know as much about cotton making or a little more so than did their masters. This, the Recorder prophesies, is a self-correcting foolishness. A year or two of experiment will give us plenty of negro labor as in days past, it insists, adding, by that time, they will get an idea in their heads as to their ability to be planters.","     In the heart of Radical Reconstruction, freedmen across the South grasped at one of their more central new freedoms - the ability to choose employment, including the right to work for no man but himself. Some chose the railroads, others paid work on plantations, but many chose to find land, whatever the cost, that they could own and farm. Such endeavors were difficult to keep running, however, with the great variance possible in cotton prices even year-to-year. The Recorder's article show an emerging strategy among whites of using control of capital, especially valuable land, to dominate black labor now that political oppression was - at least temporarily - less complete. Sharecropping, a policy where planters would grant a piece of land to farmers in exchange for a substantial portion of the harvest, would become a common arrangement across the South in the decades to follow. This arrangement, while preserving the idea of independence and self-employment, rarely allowed sharecroppers to escape poverty. Over time more complex forms of economic domination would develop. The expectations of black failure are no surprise. Rhetoric casting black men as foolish, innocent, child-like characters who simply needed time and experience to see the errors of independence would become standard throughout the region for decades to come."],"display_date":"February 1, 1869","search_date":"1869-02-01","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2041,"title":"Yankees Rampage through Barnwell\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-01","end_date":"1865-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the winter and spring of 1865, Union forces smashed through South Carolina. The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer. After burning much of the town to the ground, General Kilpatrick arrived and put a stop to the attack, though the Recorder's letter insists that he gave secret orders to burn the town after dark.","Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas focused on destroying infrastructure and demoralizing Confederate troops. With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2058,"title":"Hitting Shore With a Vengeance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Haynie Bradshaw thanked God every time he arrived back on shore. Oystermen were reputed to be daring and unscrupulous men, who regard[ed] neither the laws of God nor the laws of man, but Bradshaw was a devout Methodist who sometimes led services on Sunday. As an oysterman, Bradshaw dredged the Chesapeake Bay aboard one of the infamous bugeye boats. It was a terrible living. Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery. All the buildings had holes in the floors to toss away emptied shells. The entire town smelled of dead oysters. Girls on the street corner outside Blizzard's were hardly discreet about their employment. The town's residents used guns to disperse the rowdy drunks prowling the streets after dark. While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other. The saloon in Crisfield was a far cry from his Methodist Church back home.","While the slavery system ended years earlier, the free labor system for both blacks and whites could be awful as well. In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry.

The unit remained in northern Florida throughout its service, where the Union naval blockade intentionally caused serious import shortages on goods like coffee, tea, and salt. Salt was a commodity that was vitally necessary to preserve perishable foods for the army. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, manufacturers would produce salt by extracting it from saline artesian wells and rock salt deposits. However, during the war, due to the Union naval blockade and limited imports, Frier and his comrades had to produce their own salt by filtering it out of the dirt on the floors of meat store rooms. Frier hardly knew what to call the substance they created, for he claimed it looked more like mud than salt, but he was determined to make the most of the discovery. He and the reserve company manufactured several bushels and used them to preserve their meat during the winter of 1863. However, they soon realized that there was limited supply of useful dirt, and Frier worried that a salt famine was on the horizon. ","Since filtering salt-laden mud was not a long-term sustainable practice, Florida residents had to find other sources of salt. The method by which salt production came to be cheapest and most efficient in the state of Florida was boiling sea water, a simple process which required little machinery and which became the largest industry in the state following the Civil War. The industry helped increase civic morale and inter-state interaction during the Civil War, as many Georgians and Alabamans set up operations along the Florida coast to produce salt to sell to their home states. Critical to the development of the domestic salt production industry in the region was, indeed, Frier and his army. The war forced Southerners like Frier to look to new ways of producing those goods of which they were deprived, while it also helped to expand the previously small-scale enterprise of a few Confederate soldiers into a state-wide industry. Although Florida was strategically and physically peripheral to the Civil War, the Union coastal blockade and the occupation of its ports helped shape post war issues and industries.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

After describing the weather, terrain, and typical lifestyle, Dr. Byme acknowledged the differences between Florida cotton and that grown in other states but made sure to clarify the reason behind the variance. It is true that the average quality of Florida Cotton is not rated so high as that of the Sea Island, but the difference in this respect is chiefly, if not entirely, attributable to the defective manner of preparing the former for market. ","Despite the noted difference in quality, the long staple cotton of Florida sold for a high market price. This led Byme to claim that the lower quality (but greater amount) of Florida cotton was due more to a deficiency of care in its preparation for market than to an inferior product. Perhaps what Byme meant by claiming that there was a deficiency of care in cotton production was that the one-crop agricultural system implemented in Florida was problematic. It used crude, unscientific methods that left slaves incapable of working with the modern agricultural implements introduced in later years. Lacking versatility, Florida slaves could be taught little more than routine operations required in the growth of a single staple. ","In emphasizing the importance of quantity rather than quality for the Florida cotton planter, Byme was describing an economic reality of the region. When the Florida planter found that he could make an average crop of three hundred pounds of cotton to the acre, he was unlikely to bestow as much care on its preparation for market as the planter would on the Sea Islands of South Carolina where, Willie Lee Rose explained, one hundred twenty pounds was a good average crop. Dr. Byme wrote his pamphlet in such a way that clearly illustrated a widespread desire to jumpstart the Florida economy in the mid-nineteenth century. Byme praised the climate, landscape, people, and agriculture of Florida so as to prove the state's superiority over South Carolina and Texas, specifically. He boasted that Florida's seasons were more favorable to the production of cotton than those of any other Southern state. He wrote, Florida not only surpass[ed] Texas, but far excel[led] every other state in the Union.","In 1860, when Byme wrote the main article of his pamphlet, growing and selling cotton was, indeed, the most common way for Florida residents to earn cash. However, in future years, attempting to produce a cotton crop came to be a gamble for households that had limited labor resources (i.e. only had a small number of slaves, all of whom knew how to complete the same exact task). With the onset of the war, Floridians began to realize that they needed to reduce cotton production and increase food production if they wanted the South to survive. Many did not act through purely patriotic motives, however, but to the economic fact that cotton could not be sold in large quantities, and that foodstuffs, especially corn, could be readily sold and could produce a significant profit. Dr. Byme did not foresee the development of other agricultural industries when writing his pamphlet, but those readers who bought into his real estate propaganda soon learned the economic realities and needs of plantation life in the deep South."],"display_date":"April 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-04-01","locations":[{"id":1421,"lat":29.2235069663,"lng":-82.0960676488,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2090,"title":"Charles Whitehead Ridicules Jackson&#39;s Domestic Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-01","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jackson was a wealthy Florida planter who inherited several acres of land from his family. He owned dogs, horses, and men-servants and maid-servants were born in his house, and the forests surrounding Jackson's plantation were plentiful with wild animals. In 1860, he and Charles Whitehead decided to practice their hunting techniques on his property. They camped by the side of his house to spend a few days in pursuit of the chase. They relaxed in the tent and laughed wildly as the negroes ran to prepare food and the little nigs looked on from every out-of-the-way corner. They sat and drank as the slaves cooked for them in one of those little disconnected kitchens so favored by your true darky cook, who, when not turning the corn-bread, stands in her red bandana in the doorway with her arms akimbo, looming as large as the wonderful fat woman in the Museum. (Akimbo is a body position in which the hands are on the hips and the elbows are bowed outward.) Jovial and relaxed, Whitehead and Jackson cracked jokes about Jackson's slaves while they worked to prepare dinner and to maintain Jackson's estate.","The slaves Whitehead described clearly lived and worked in close proximity to where Jackson interacted with his fellow white men. While most Florida slaves usually ate in their cabins, those that Whitehead described were charged with the task of cooking and were also allowed to eat supper near their masters. This led to intense ridicule and the formation of stereotypes and derogatory terms about domestic blacks that persisted for decades. In his written accounts of his hunting adventures in the Everglades region of Florida, Charles Whitehead used terms like nig and darky to delineate the stark contrasts he perceived between the blacks and whites on Jackson's property. Not being wealthy enough to own slaves himself, Whitehead probably did not have any direct interaction with individual slaves. Therefore, his perception of blacks was all the more harsh and impersonal. For Whitehead, as for many, poor treatment of slaves was a way to dehumanize the black race in such a way that negated any guilt on the part of the white race."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":1428,"lat":26.6841881812,"lng":-82.0889710874,"zoom":7,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2124,"title":"Virginia General Assembly Votes on Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-09","end_date":"1835-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By 1835, the Industrial Revolution had swept up Richmond in its wave of innovation and change. At a time when massive advancements were being made in the areas of agriculture, factory production, transportation, and communication, Richmond's General Assembly was still reeling from the logistics of such a massive overhaul. In early January, an advertisement was taken out in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser alerting the public to a petition about to be presented to the Assembly. If passed, the newspaper said, the petition would allow a railroad to be constructed, from the Coal Mines in Chesterfield, to some eligible point on James River, below Whitby bar as well as a line that would end near Belona Arsenal, in said county. At the time this issue was being voted on, Richmond (like the United States) was at a crossroads of economic growth. More than ever, industrial success depended on tying resources, markets, and people together in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Railroads were becoming the preferred way to do this, and any effort by the legislature to build an expensive railroad needed a lot of public support. ","But why was the General Assembly so eager to link coal mines with industrial centers (like Richmond) on the James River? The answer reflects an underlying fear that plagued many Virginians in the early nineteenth century: economic inferiority. Virginia had been a dominant producer of coal in the early decades of the nation's history, but by the 1830's the state was beginning to feel the strain of economic division. Rather than devoting itself completely to the production of one good (like states in the deeper South who depended on cotton), Virginia had diversified. As a result, coal miners in the west found themselves in competition with planters in the east for slave labor and transportation resources. This strain resulted in high prices and poor quality, setting Virginia behind other coal-producing states further north. Railroads represented a possible remedy for this problem, and would give entrepreneurs the ability to move coal from the mines to Richmond fast enough to be competitive with other states. Unfortunately, even the infusion of new technology brought on by the Industrial Revolution could not save Virginia's mining business. Although officials in Richmond tried to revive the industry (and gain public support), coal mining in the state was destined to remain the victim of arrested industrialization."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2131,"title":"The Wheat Economy in Antebellum Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-09-12","end_date":"1830-09-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["George Watson was a businessman in antebellum Richmond.

Like any businessman, he also kept a tight eye on his bottom line - constantly setting and resetting the price of wheat once demand started to pick up. Watson was also George Valentine's boss. Valentine, an overseer in the wheat trade, regularly made the long wagon trip from the wheat farms near Richmond to the mill in Louisa to deliver bushels of grain to be ground into flour. Besides making sure every wagonload got where it needed to go, Valentine was also the middle man between Watson and the mill operators. Like any good employee, he tried to get his boss a good deal. When Watson wanted to fix the price of each shipment in order to turn a heavier profit, Valentine took care of business on the ground level. After one particular journey to the mill, Valentine told Watson he could, fix the price any time you please for the whole crop in order to maximize revenue. Watson and Valentine were clearly regular customers in the wheat trade, and were cut a good deal by the owners of the mill for their patronage.

Farmers like Watson helped the state become one of the leading wheat producers in the nation, with Richmond serving as a central trading point. Virginia growers often shipped hundreds of thousands of bushels of wheat per year to Northern cities and foreign ports.

Printing in the years leading up to the Civil War was more advanced than ever, and as a result, printed material began to blanket every corner of the United States.","Even with books, journals, newspapers, and pamphlets encroaching on all aspects of daily life, the most popular literature to roll off the antebellum presses was the almanac. Almanacs were known as the poor man's Bible because of their practicality and widespread use among all classes. Leafing through the latest edition, a farmer could learn just about anything, from how to plant and harvest crops to how to break ill news. Almanacs also contained more civic-minded information, such as a list of the members of the General Assembly and a schedule for sessions of the local and federal courts.","Almanacs included so much useful information that many families kept a copy in their homes at all times (since they never knew when it might be useful).

As the sun fell below the horizon, word was sent down from the house that grandma had gone to sleep for the night. A family servant told the visitor, Mr. Davis, that it was time for bed and offered to make up a room for him to stay the night. Much to the surprise of Caroline, the young man said he had not intended to stay and was actually planning on riding over to a neighbor's house that night on business. This created a problem because it was pitch dark outside. Mr. Davis suggested that if he waited at the Watsons' until the moon rose, he could find his way along the unlit roads. Immediately, Caroline consulted the family almanac, which said the moon would rise around nine o'clock that night. While they waited for the moon, Caroline and Mr. Davis were frequently interrupted by messages from her tired (and angry) grandmother, who eventually concluded the two were going to stay up all night.","By reading Caroline Watson's account of her family's evening visitor, it is clear just how often and in how many situations the almanac was consulted.

An accident such as this would have been very bad news for any southern plantation owner.

Quitman could have only hoped that the remainder of his cotton would be recovered. "," On September 20, Quitman received a letter from A&J Dennis, the firm in New Orleans through which he shipped his cotton. The firm obviously had not received his shipment and had heard of the accident. A&J Dennis hoped that only a small portion of the cotton was actually damaged. Luckily for Quitman, he held insurance on his shipment. The insurance would cover the cotton at thirty-five dollars a bale, which would have been close to the value of Quitman's cotton. "," The destruction of the <em>Vicksburg </em>would have been very harmful to Quitman if his cotton had been lost. The importance of cotton in the 1830s cannot be overstated.

Many slaves entertained the idea of running away to the North, prompted by news about freedom for blacks from northern abolitionists that was creeping into southern territory. The southern belief that the Republican Party was out to destroy slavery caused animosity towards the North and during the year before the start of the Civil War in April 1861, tensions reached an all time high between the northern and southern states. The controversial election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted southerners to begin considering the idea of succession much more seriously. The northern abolitionist's rhetoric of freeing the enslaved African Americans did nothing to please white southerners like Alden Spooner Forbes who depended on the labor of enslaved people to earn a livelihood. The thought that this very same rhetoric of equality and freedom was reaching the ears of their laborers intensified the white southern secessionists' hostility towards the northern abolitionists. The fear of new ideas of freedom formulating in their slaves' minds provoked many, like Forbes, to be especially harsh on their laborers in an attempt to keep them from trying to escape."," Mississippi did indeed secede from the Union on January 9, 1861. People like Forbes who depended on the labor of slaves drove this secession because they could not imagine a world without slavery, like the one they thought northern Republicans would try to create.

It was this fear that prompted many of them, in Mississippi and the rest of the South, to use cruel methods, such as whipping, to try and convince them that life as an enslaved laborer was the only life for them.

With very little money or land of their own, they were often unsure of how or where to proceed next. A system of sharecropping thus evolved where the newly freedmen rented tracts of land from landowners and were expecting to give the landowners a portion of the profits made from the crops harvested on that land. Labor contracts were then signed arranging the details of what was expected of the freedmen and of the landowner.","On February 17, 1865, newly freed Henry Kanes, signed a contract with Chandler Sueham in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The contract allotted that Sueham, the landowner, would provide Kanes with the land and tools necessary to produce a crop, and in return, Kanes was to attend to Sueham's flock (no specific animal stated), as well as pay Sueham back one-third of the profits he gleaned from the land. Contracts like this led to discontent between the sharecroppers and landowners because they often felt like the other was not holding up their end of the bargain. Disputes arose because of beliefs that perhaps the sharecropper was not working hard enough, or that the landowner was not providing what was agreed upon in the signed contract. The Assistant Commissioner for the state of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land, reported to General O.O. Howard on November 28, 1868, that there had been many complaints filed recently about these labor contracts. The problems reported were specifically prompted by an upcoming election for delegates to the state convention that had impelled many freedmen to leave their work for the purpose of attending meetings held by political aspirants. The landowners from the Mississippi delta region were particularly unhappy because the laborers had missed several prime harvest days for the meetings, and they felt that the crops had thus faltered. "," Instances like these led to the precarious situation that Mississippi found itself in after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The majority of the newly freed people were generally unable to use what little savings they might have had to buy land of their own. Thus, they once again found themselves having to answer to a superior, who was normally a white man. The sharecropping system, originally intended to help the freed people on their way towards full independence had thus began to resemble the system of slavery that had prevailed for so long before it. The labor contracts were usually heavily weighted in favor of the white landowner, and the wages earned by the sharecroppers were so low that black women and children found themselves having to work so the family could survive. Women usually kept house for white families, and children engaged in seasonal field labor. Thus, emancipation did not eliminate the need for large amounts of labor in the South, and the labor contracts that resulted only slightly increased freedmen's control over their situation. In places like the Mississippi Delta, entire freed families found themselves working in order to make ends meet. Labor contracts gave the newly freedmen some sense of independence from white masters, but the conflicts that arose from the differing opinions of the laborers and landowners led to discontent among the majority of southerners dealing with the system of sharecropping."],"display_date":"February 17, 1865 - November 28, 1868","search_date":"1867-01-08","locations":[{"id":7123,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2177,"title":"Death of the Respectable Adam Grove\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-24","end_date":"1842-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shermariah Church, the Presbyterian Church of Augusta County, Virginia lost a valuable member of their congregation when Mr. Adam Grove died suddenly and unexpectedly on February 24, 1842. Mr. Grove's spirituality transcended Shermariah into the educational realm in that he served as a professor of religion for 20 years. His religious beliefs manifested themselves in his charitable nature. He donated a significant portion of the land on which Shermariah Chuch was constructed and also donated funds to help build the Shermariah Academy. Unlike many of the deaths that occurred in Augusta County in the antebellum South, Mr. Grove's was unique in that he died free of debt. His lack of debt can also be attributed to his religious beliefs. Grove was very familiar with the scriptures and lived by them. One such scriptural saying was, owe no man anything.","It was said that Mr. Grove's farm reflected many of his admirable characteristics such as his good management and industrious habits. Though he possessed only a small piece of land, it was lucrative due to its high state of cultivation. At the time of Mr. Grove's death, the land was worth two to three times more than if he had bought two to three additional pieces of farmland. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Mr. Grove's death, however, is the fact that one of his servant women died about 15 minutes after he did. She was also a member of Shermariah Church and it was believed by the citizens of Augusta County that they had both gone to the same blessed reward. ","The dichotomy of this obituary lies in the fact that during life of earth, slaveholders of Augusta County treated African Americans not only as their inferiors, but as their property; meanwhile, they sat through church services in the same sanctuary. They worshipped the same god and believed that they experienced the same afterlife. The role churches played in race relations of the antebellum South is a major theme in Melvin Patrick Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>. Ely portrays a culture similar to that of this obituary, where blacks and whites attended the same churches. These churches nurtured the moral similarities of people of both races. Furthermore, according to Ely, churches leveled the playing field between whites and blacks by acknowledging the spiritual gifts of each, and by identifying their equal ability to sin. During the 1840s and 1850s, white evangelicals felt it was their duty to bring black members into their churches. Spending on ministries to slaves increased dramatically. In the Methodist Church in particular, it increased from 167,258.87 in 1829 to 1,706,207.70 by 1864. This may give us some insight as to why Mr. Grove and his servant participated in the same church service.

In Chatham County, they invested a lot of money in growing rice, as did many planters across the lowcountry regions of both states. However, in 1844 Charles began to be slightly disgruntled with the labor production of his slaves and began comparing their efficiency to that of other slaves. Other planters told him that twelve bushels of clean winnowed rice would be average one day, but then the next day they would only get about five or six. This inconsistency was unsettling to most large planters. Manigault voiced his concerns with his overseer A.R. Bagshaw. Bagshaw told him that with the twenty-five slaves that were working the threshing area, they should get at least fifteen bushels a day. However, the week before they were only producing about ten bushels. This led to the consternation of Manigault and the overseer, and they blamed the slaves. They accused the slaves of finding ways to get around their production duties, and of only fulfilling them to the rule, not to the greatest extent. Bagshaw said that the slaves were cunning enough to remember that what they are harvesting they will have to thresh, and will tie as small sheaves as they can. Manigault tried to come up with a solution to this production problem, but Bagshaw assured him that the slaves were smart and efficient enough to find ways to get around them.","The problem Manigault had with his rice production was not unique to his plantation. In fact, it happened in plantations all over the lowcountry districts of South Carolina and Georgia. The unique rice-growing agriculture in those districts called for a different kind of labor than did the cotton or tobacco growing areas. There were limits to planter's authority all over the South, because no matter how harsh they were, slaves often were cunning or brave enough to find ways to subvert their master's plans. It was even easier for slaves to do this in the lowcountry rice area, where Manigault had his plantation, due to the type of task forces that were used for cultivating rice. The tasks were not based on time (such as working from 6 am to 6 pm) but on how many crops were produced. Planters decided what they thought was a reasonable amount of product, and the slaves had to cultivate that amount. Once the slaves were done, they often got to use their free time for other activities such as socializing, selling or tending their own crops, and other activities. So slaves, such as those on Manigault's plantation, found ways to produce the right amount of sheaves but made them smaller in size. This way, they could get around their masters orders while still fulfilling his supposed goals. Also, jobs on these plantations were more individualized than on cotton plantations, so an industrious slave could complete his day's work faster and have more free time than his owner expected. To some extent slaves could reject the clock on a rice plantation and work at their own pace as long as they completed the task. Also, not working as efficiently as a master wanted, but still getting working so as to avoid punishment, was a strong form of resistance among slaves. Slaves did not often feel personally about their work, so subverting their masters by producing slightly less was a good way to punish their owners. So although Manigault and his neighbors felt frustrated about the labor on their plantations, these frustrations were most likely felt all across the lowcountry districts of the South, due to the nature of their agricultural system and its needs, and to the cleverness of the slaves that worked their fields."],"display_date":1844,"search_date":"1844-07-01","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2197,"title":"James Cody Sues John Baily Over Slander Regarding Illegal Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-12-11","end_date":"1850-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Cody of Bryan County, Georgia prided himself in having a good reputation as a respectable Southern man. When his neighbor John Baily accused him of buying rice from a slave without written permission from the slave's owner, he was extremely offended. He considered these accusations to be false and demanded to meet John Baily in court to settle this slanderous dispute. Cody felt that Baily's remarks offended his honor and implied that Cody was a dishonest trader and guilty of buying and keeping stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He felt that his good reputation was at stake and he needed to go to court to settle the matter. He also demanded that Baily pay him 5,000 dollars in damages, a huge sum in the 1850's.",">James Cody's indignation and determination to repair his honor, seek redress, and prove that he would not illegally trade with slaves demonstrates many important principles and customs of the South in the 1850's. Lawsuits about slander and false accusations were not uncommon in the South, especially among men. This was due to the fact that a man's honor was central to his sense of self and his public image, so any kind of slander or ill talk would be insulting. Insults, or anything that offended a man's honor, questioned a man's very masculinity. Many people in the South reacted very strongly to an affront to their respectability, and would take the accuser to court. For example, a man in Prince Edwards County, Virginia took his slanderer to court, saying he would rather get back his honor than get money in the case. To those Southerners who did sue for money, such as Cody, the huge amounts of money they asked for probably represented how offended they were at an affront to their honor. ","The second aspect of this case that represented the state of the South, was the fact that the specific slander regarded a white man trading with a slave without the master's permission. Black Codes or laws regarding slaves and their conduct had existed since the very beginning of the eighteenth century, but they got more rigid and more encompassing throughout the nineteenth century all across the South. It was illegal in most states by 1850 for a slave to trade or sell goods without his master's written consent. He was not allowed to trade publicly for his own benefit at all unless his master deemed this acceptable, which some did. A slave guilty of violating a law like this was often punished with a whipping. One reason for this law was that trading and selling allowed slaves some degree of autonomy and gave them their own money, if their master did not demand the proceeds they made from their sales. It also gave them more independence and could make less interested in their master's concerns, which was something whites came to fear more and more as the number of slaves rose. As their numbers rose, so did the potential threat for rebellion or a general challenging of complete white supremacy. Also, as questions over slavery were discussed elsewhere in the nation it added to the insecurity felt throughout the South.","The result of the Cody-Bailey case is not known, or was at least not documented in the court petition record, or it may have been lost over time. However, the important themes that arise in this case are themes that pervaded the pre-war South. The ideas of male honor, the power of slander and the lawsuits that could arise from it, and of the increase in slave codes throughout the South in the mid-eighteenth century, all speak of important ideals and trends in both Georgia, and the South, as a whole."],"display_date":"December 11, 1850","search_date":"1850-12-11","locations":[{"id":1562,"lat":31.8212333753,"lng":-81.1636262055,"zoom":9,"place":"BRYAN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2237,"title":"Arthur P.

Their son, Glenn, worked nearby on a tugboat that went up and down the Mississippi, and Frank, a tinsmith from New Orleans, continued a desperate search for work throughout the year. Alice, also out of work, remained on the houseboat most of the time, except for a few explorations of the city of St. Louis on foot to entertain herself. Both Frank and Alice wrote regularly to their brother and sister, Arthur and Ellen P. Thrasher. The correspondence from Frank and Alice to Arthur and Ellen illustrates the fact that Frank and Alice are having serious financial troubles harbored in Missouri, from which they cannot seem to get out from underneath. Alice wrote to Arthur on August 2, 1897, not a thing to complain about, only the lack of income. And consequently running behind financially. Alice spends much of her letter to Arthur relating to him how she felt blue and worried almost obsessively over finances, although she was very proud of Glenn for having a job, which was not easy to come by in St. Louis in that time. ","Alice made it very clear in her letters that the living and working conditions of St. Louis were uncomfortable and poor compared to other cities she lived in before that were farther south, like New Orleans. In her letter of August 2, And if we ever succeed in getting out, I think we will give it a 'wide berth' in the future. Alice and Frank had plans to sell the boat to the first buyer and head for home via New York City, but as Frank observed in a letter written on August 24, 1897: There don't seem to be anyone around here with money enough to buy a boat yet but I still am thinking there will be before many weeks now. Frank, who was a little more optimistic in his letters to his relatives than Alice, wrote in a letter postmarked July 12, 1897, Business is about the same with us. I have no work yet but think will have some soon. I put an ad in the paper and may hear something from that but will not be surprised in case nothing comes of it as money is sure scarce. ","From living on a houseboat, the Thrashers were able to get a broader perspective of conditions up and down the Mississippi than most southerners. Alice was aware of St. Louis in relation to other cities in the North and South, which she made clear in her August 2 letter: I am convinced this is the very largest city I was ever in. I have found just that it claims nearly 700,000 population. And since Brooklyn has helped to swell New York city's population, St. Louis has become the 4th city in size in the U.S. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago being greater; they, running up into the millions in counting their population. She was also aware of the conditions in New Orleans because of her family there. When Mrs. Alice Thrasher wrote to their relations in New Orleans, she indicated that they were well off, and at times was slightly jealous in the letters to her sister, Ellen, Your letter was 'breezy and hopeful': I only wish I had some of the of the work that you and Aunt Lil each do. But while I have not, I am not so one- sided in my sympathies that I can't feel glad that you are prospering. "," Frank and Alice were well-traveled, and could see the differences not only between the cities of the northern and southern parts of the South, but the differences between the North and South as a whole. They often noted in their letters that their poor economic standing was not uncommon in other southern cities in the nineteenth century. Instead of a middle class, the South and its, conservative form of urban industrialism after the Civil War gave birth to a fairly economically polarized society. Factors that caused this gap between the very wealthy and very poor might have been a combination of economic, social and political factors which kept the region off what Jonathan M. Wiener called the classic capitalist path that had been blazed by England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and followed by the northern states. There was a large expectation for the South during Reconstruction to quickly join in the industrial revolution of the North. But cities like St. Louis, although big and bustling, did not always provide enough jobs for skilled craftsmen. Factories wanted men who could act as cogs in textile mills, not men like Frank Thrasher who was a skilled tinsmith. Even if Thrasher took a job in a factory, wages were shockingly low. Historian William H. Nicholls argued that perhaps, had the pace of the South's post-bellum industrial development matched that of the earlier industrial Revolution of England or New England... The Southern middle class would have flowered more profusely. Some historians, like Wilbur J. Cash, argue that because economics in the South were originally based on plantations, the region's middle class remained subservient to the values of the planter, the result of which was an economy that only benefited a small but powerful coalition of planters, merchants and industrialists. Cities like St. Louis in the nineteenth-century urban South did not get the economic boom for middle class men like Thrasher that the North did."],"display_date":"1895 - 1898","search_date":"1896-12-31","locations":[{"id":8037,"lat":38.6358212793,"lng":-90.2450510752,"zoom":11,"place":"ST LOUIS CITY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2254,"title":"Death, Love, and War","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-06-30","end_date":"1861-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The operation was dangerous: destroying a bridge near a railroad ten miles away from camp in Martinsville, Virginia.

Murrell bought Tally Ho Plantation in Iberville Parish in 1848. The plantation was run by an overseer named L. Hewett, who communicated with Murrell through a series of letters, most posted to an address in Lynchburg and some to an address in New Orleans.  In the letters, Hewett told Murrell about the day to day productivity of the sugar plantation, asked for his boss's instructions, explained how those instructions were followed, made recommendations as to how the plantation should be run, and reported on the health and behavior of the enslaved people of the plantation.  In a letter from February 1849, Hewett wrote that he had put goods out to be collected on the bank of the river, but for some reason, they remained there.  The person who was supposed to pick up the goods sent word that he would collect them on his next trip.  Hewett explained that since Murrell had given him no instructions to send the goods on another boat, he would not do so. One problem that Hewett had managing the estate was that he had to constantly wait for instructions from an owner who lived far from the plantation he owned.  This prevented Hewett from making time-sensitive decisions, such as whether or not to ship goods on a different boat than the one originally agreed upon.  Hewett's problem was not uncommon throughout the South; many men who had wealth, name and influence in their home communities and who did not wish to leave these places, bought and operated distant sugar plantations in hopes of making large amounts of money.  These men hired overseers to manage the plantations, and made decisions through mail.  This arrangement could be frustrating to both the owners and the overseers.  ","Since owners usually knew little about the people they hired and were not present to supervise them, they had to worry about being cheated.  Overseers would sometimes neglect their jobs, steal from the owners of the plantations, or make important decisions without informing the owner.  Overseers, in turn, would often have to deal with owners who did not know the correct ways to deal with crops and who gave bad orders.  Since owners rarely visited they did not always fully understand the needs of the far away plantations they owned and overseers would have to convince them of what was needed without offending them.   When time-sensitive decisions had to be made, it was the overseer's job to make them and hope that his boss did not get angry.  To make plantations profitable for both the absentee planter and the overseer the two had to learn to trust and respect each other, or else the plantation would risk failing or performing poorly.

It was hardly a triumphant parade of U.S. naval power. The Sailing Master of such a flagship was one Edward C. Anderson, and he took in the alien landscape as it passed on either side. Upon arriving at Miami, he found it to be little more than a collection of armed occupants, so called, receiving from government a certain quantity of land as a grant, in a suffocating tropical environment. Possible fertile river bed soil was made worthless by layers of limestone, and the horizon stretched off into a pine barren land. Worsening an already unspectacular picture were the horseflies and mosquitoes that infested the region; all animals must be covered and kept in dark stables or the insects would make the blood trickle from every pore.","Indeed, Miami's future did not seem bright, but the settlers there were still very sanguine of establishing eventually a flourishing settlement and have laid out a town yet to be built. Anderson was not so hopeful. He did not see it possible that Miami could become much more than it is for there are few facilities and no capital either at present or in prospect. In geographical terms, Miami is situated between the Bay of Biscayne to the east and the vast Everglades to the west. The area is a virtual swampland, abundant in peat and humid soil and averaging 65.5 inches of rainfall per year. Miami was not adapted for general agricultural development, and outsiders, such as Anderson, gave the settlement up for dead in 1844. The story of how Miami came to be one of the leading cities in Florida, the South, and the nation in the twentieth century is one of natural resources and an adaptive economy.","The antebellum history of Miami is marked by the same patterns as other Florida cities: Indian attacks, hurricanes, and poor agriculture. Miami became the seat of Dade County in 1844, the same year Master Anderson visited, but the county's population would decrease from 446 in 1840 to 85 in 1870. To put this in perspective, Dade County is almost the size of the state of Massachusetts. This mass migration was due, in part, to Seminole hostilities; the settlement did not recover. Miami's identity as a city would begin to take shape after 1870. Pioneers won their lands from the jungle around Miami and soil was reclaimed through canal drainage systems. Population rose to 861 in 1890, 3,322 in 1895, and would explode in the twentieth century with the extension of Henry M. Flagler's East Coast Railroad to Miami in 1896. Miami emerged as a resort and tourist destination and remains such to this day. ","Florida was very different from the rest of the South: stormier, swampier, less networked by railroads, and ravaged by Indian wars. With the exception of the Cotton districts in west and central Florida around Tallahassee, Florida failed to be a major cash crop producer. It excelled in citrus plantations but little else. Early on, Miami just did not fit in the mold of a prosperous southern city. The economic system was agricultural, and Miami could not function within that system and was pushed out of it. Even in 1880, Miami was practically nonexistent. Anderson would have seemed to be correct about the city and its settlers. Miami, along with other Florida cities, adapted with the system, and the advent of sophisticated railroads and the tourist industry gave Miami a specialization it could do well. A look back at Miami in 1844 shows how the physical surroundings and geographic location of settlements are the most important determinant of how cities develop, when they develop, and how they will be judged as a success by outsiders."],"display_date":"May 25, 1844","search_date":"1844-05-25","locations":[{"id":1317,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DADE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2283,"title":"The Richest Slave \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1846-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the fall of 1845, caterpillars destroyed the cotton crop in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, where Solomon Northup was enslaved. His master, along with other planters, sent their slaves, including Northup, south to St. Mary's Parish to hire themselves out on the sugar plantations where labor was needed and wages were high. Northup was hired out to a Judge Turner who lived on the Bayou Salle. After being given several different tasks, Northup was put in the sugarhouse. He acted in the capacity of driver; he was given a whip and told to use it on anyone who was idle. If he failed to do so, he would be whipped himself. The process of sugar making continued day and night; Northup had no regular times to rest and got little sleep. ","One advantage to working in the sugarhouse was that Northup was paid for some of his work. Louisiana custom mandated that a slave retain whatever compensation he may obtain for services performed on Sundays; this money allowed him to buy necessary articles such as utensils to cook with. To ask for these seemingly everyday and inconsequential things would have ended in laughter, a kick, or even a whipping from the master according to Northup's autobriography, <em>Twelve Years A Slave. Narrative Of Solomon Northup.</em> In the book, Northup also points out that however injurious to the morals, it [was] certainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave, to be permitted to break the Sabbath and be able to purchase everyday items. Northup earned 10 in Sabbath money. He added to this by playing his violin at a party given by one of Judge Turner's neighbors. He ended up with 17, which he took great pleasure in counting. He would spend his time dreaming of the water pails, pocket knives, new shoes and coats and hats and other everyday items that he would be able to buy. He also took great pleasure in being the wealthiest slave on the Bayou Boeuf when he returned home in January of 1846."," On a sugar plantation, such as Northup worked on, labor was almost continuous. Planting began in January and ended in March; cultivation began in March and lasted till July. Farm chores were done until grinding began in October. During the grinding season a mill would run almost nonstop from early Monday morning until noon on Saturday. It required work and constant supervision, and those chosen both to accomplish and oversee the task, like Northup, got little to no rest. Sometimes slaves were even required to work on the Sabbath, but, as in the case of Northup, slaves were usually paid for the work they did on this day usually reserved for rest. ","Throughout the South, planters of all types of crops often hired slaves from other plantations to provide extra help. Slaves' owners, as in Northup's case, sometimes hired out their slaves to other planters; in this situation the slave's master would usually take at least some of the money the slave earned in the job. Slave owners also found it profitable to hire slaves out to industry, such the lumber industry, or to the state for public works projects. Sometimes slaves were able to hire themselves out, meaning they could keep their own earnings. After the slave received his or her money, then that slave was free to spend it. Slaves often spent what little money they were able to make on providing themselves and their families with extra food and clothing. They could also buy small luxuries such as furniture.","Northup had not grown up having to spend endless hours working fervently in a hot sugar-grinding mill, nor did he grow up having to work on Sundays or play his violin at parties just to earn money to buy the few necessities of life. Northup had been born a free man but was kidnapped in 1841 while visiting Washington, D.C. He was drugged, threatened with death, and then put on a boat to New Orleans where a slave dealer sold him into slavery. His story, though unusual, was not unique. Not all African Americans sold in the slave yards were born into slavery; some where free men and women who had been kidnapped and sold South where they would be unable to escape or solicit help. Free African Americans were kidnapped from all over the United States in the nineteenth century. They were kidnapped from within the South. Three generations from one free African American family were kidnapped from Point Coupee, Louisiana, and sold in New Orleans. They were kidnapped in the Midwest; a free African American named John Merry from Illinois was arrested in St. Louis and sold in New Orleans. Northup himself was from New York in the North. Some of these kidnapped men, including both Northup and Merry, were able to get friends from the North to help them win back their freedom, but others did not always have friends who could help. Whether or not they were able to escape, they had to grow accustomed, for at least a little while, to being a piece of property who had been bought and paid for and who had to struggle though long hours of hard work for which they usually received no pay."],"display_date":"1845 - 1846","search_date":"1845-12-31","locations":[{"id":5713,"lat":29.8296521317,"lng":-91.9512085468,"zoom":9,"place":"ST MARY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2285,"title":"Southside Virginians in the Spanish American War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["July 31 - Pendleton, Charles - Harris Creek - Amherst County - Railroad Brakesman - 27 years of age - Single - 5'7.5 - 136 pounds - Chest Measurement 34 and 36.5 - Ruddy Complexion - Blue Eyed - Light Brown Hair - Accepted - Vaccinated was how the many Army documents read in the collection of James Dearing Fauntleroy.

These documents became important when the United States declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898.","Leading up to the war, the United States had a great deal of interest in purchasing Cuba because many Americans had invested in sugar plantations. In fact, by 1895 Americans had already invested approximately 50 million dollars in Cuba with the profits from trade being close to double that amount. President Grover Cleveland announced on June 12, 1895 that the United States was neutral, even as fervor for war increased in the United States. Spanish General Valeriano Weyler decided that insurgents in Cuba would be easier to control by the Spanish Army if they were located in the center of the Cuban island, so he enacted a policy of Reconcentration and then put the entire island under marital law. On December 7 of the same year, President Cleveland changed his decisions stating that the United States would become involved in the Cuban conflict if Spain failed to end the crisis.","After the explosion aboard the U.S.S. Maine on February 15, 1898, it looked as though the United States would definitely become involved in the conflict. On March 28, the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry determined that a mine caused the explosion on the U.S.S. Maine. Later that spring in April President McKinley ordered a blockade of Cuba just four days before declaring war on Spain. Once American troops landed in Cuba in June, the Marines captured Guantanamo Bay. The Mobilization Act of April 22 enabled approximately 190,000 regular Army members and volunteers to join the troops already in Cuba. After troops attacked from San Juan and in the San Juan port in early July, Spain signed an unconditional surrender agreement on July 16. A peace treaty signed between representatives of the United States and Spain on December 10, 1898 in Paris, France determined the independence of Cuba while ceding both Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States and allowing the purchase of the Philippines Island by the United States.","At the end of the war, the United States had invested 250 million in the war and lost 3,000 lives.

Guion wrote that his plantation had increased in both size and productivity since his first application for a loan due to the fencing of his land, the erection of a cotton gin and a gristmill, and from the cutting of ditches. As security for the additional loan he offered to the bank his plantation and sixteen slaves whose ages ranged from sixteen months to fifty years. It is unknown if the bank granted his loan. ","Banks in Louisiana were encouraged by the state to make large loans to planters in order promote agriculture and commerce. The state mandated that banks open branches in plantation areas and make a certain number of mortgage loans, specifying the geographical distribution of the loans around the state. Although collateralized transactions usually accounted for a small number of credit transactions, slaves were the most popular form of collateral for those short-term and long-term loans that required collateral. For example, slaves accounted for 80 percent of the securities offered in recorded mortgages in antebellum East Feliciana Parish in Louisiana. Slaves could also be used as collateral for purchasing shares in Louisiana's investment banks. ","In the South, slaves were property-they could be bought, sold and transported to any location that allowed slavery. As property, their owners could use slaves when they needed loans. The income stream, or the prospective value of a slave on the present market, influenced the amount each slave was mortgaged for; thus a slave's value was measured in cash. The mortgages usually consisted of recognition of a debt by the debtor and a description of the debt and the property being mortgaged and the time and means by which the mortgaged property had been purchased. Banks all over the South allowed slaveholders to use their slaves as collateral. The Bank of Charleston in South Carolina, founded in 1834, accepted at least five hundred and twenty nine slaves as collateral for mortgages and loans in the years before the Civil War. They also confiscated and owned an unknown number of these slaves when loans were defaulted upon.

Johnson had a very specific vision for the property; I want a colony of ten families from the Northwest to settle here, he wrote. Traditionally Southside Virginia, including Amelia County, had a rural background with very few towns of any size. In both the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until the end of slavery, Southside Virginia had borrowed from the Chesapeake region the tobacco economy based upon slave labor, only lacking the wealth and sophistication. Johnson knew that the area would not attract those seeking great wealth, so he aimed his advertisement towards families committed to a rural lifestyle.","Bradley Tyler Johnson promoted the property through its location and land attributes. First, Johnson advertised on his flyer that the Woodlands was located only two and a half miles from the Amelia County Courthouse and 36 miles southwest of Richmond by the Southern Railroad. Other benefits the property based on its location included receiving mail twice a day, two newspapers - one from Baltimore, Maryland and the other from Washington, D.C., and telegraph service. Next Johnson went into detail in describing the many land attributes such as the red clay soil, the alluvium river bottoms, the oak forest, and plentiful streams and springs. He said that the Uplands have never been ploughed since the flood 'Before the Wah'. I suppose they were scrathed for an inch to an inch and a half, in depth by a mule and a n----r, but below that depth has never been stirred by the hand of man, and is just as virgin, as the morning Noah landed on Arabat. Johnson made plans to divide the Amelia County land into farms of 150 acres each and suggested that the settlers grow orchards of apples, grapes, pears, plums, and cherries.","Although it was not entirely clear whether Johnson would have leased the land to sharecroppers, sharecropping was a very common practice during and after Reconstruction. Sharecropping was leasing land to families who would pay their rent by giving the owner a portion of the crop grown on the land. During Reconstruction not only freedmen and women but also poor whites without land practiced sharecropping in Virginia. The practice continued strongly after Reconstruction especially in rural areas formerly based upon the labor of slaves such as the tobacco farms in Amelia County. Sharecropping exploited the people who worked the land by charging high interest rates on borrowed goods and by demanding large portions of their crop. Plantation owners in rural areas found themselves without labor after the Civil War and the practice of sharecropping helped to alleviate the burden of labor.","Johnson was a wealthy man who owned land in Amelia County while spending much of his time in his Richmond, Virginia home. He had a strong desire to lease his land to a colony of families who are neighbors and friends at home and would be so in a new country instead of Virginia locals who were likely to be freedmen and women. It is clear from the language of the advertisement that Johnson only planned to lease the land to white families based on a discussion of black labor and the use of derogatory, racist language. Johnson told the story of rural farmland and woodland where a family could find happiness but not riches instead of telling the story of sharecropping and how difficult life could be."],"display_date":"August 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-08-21","locations":[{"id":13617,"lat":37.3359551661,"lng":-77.9760581709,"zoom":10,"place":"AMELIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2292,"title":"A Letter to Congress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-06-23","end_date":"1842-06-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Several planters and sugar manufacturers from Jefferson Parish joined with citizens from parishes across the state of Louisiana in signing and sending a letter to the United States Congress pleading for increases in tariffs on imported sugar. Stating that the Tariff of 1832 had caused the agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing interests of Louisiana's sugar industry to become paralyzed, they said Louisiana sugar planters needed tariffs on sugar to be high so that Americans would buy their domestic sugar instead. The planters claimed that soon every mechanic, every manufacturer, every merchant, every farmer, every corporation, in our happy Union, [would become] a bankrupt. The planters urged Congress to reinstate the Tariff of 1816, so as to protect the industry.","This letter shows an instance where economics dominated over regionalism in the South. Generally, the South exported their goods and bought imported goods, making them favor lower tariffs. Tariffs were meant to protect United States industries from foreign competition, and since most of the South did not have U.S. market interests they did not care for the tariffs. But the sugar industry did care; they hoped to dominate the American market, but to do that they would need foreign sugar to cost more, and thus they favored high protective tariffs.","This favoring of high protective tariffs meant that planters across the South voted for politicians who also favored protective tariffs. Generally this meant that Southern planters voted for the Whigs. The Whigs supported high tariffs so as to protect homegrown interests. Tariffs proposed in Congress were usually voted for by Whigs, while Democrats generally opposed and tried to stop the passage of tariffs. The Whigs also appealed to Southerners because they believed in states' rights. These shared values helped create a mutually beneficial relationship between the party and the South.

She claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Peter McQueen, an Indian prophet whom the United States Army had been pursuing for some time. General Jackson had recently just narrowly missed capturing his at Natural Bridge. As per his quick temper, the general was enraged. This Seminole woman presumably heard through word of mouth-there were some Indians serving under General Jackson's command-about his near miss. She offered to turn McQueen over to the United States in return for General Jackson to allow her people to be transported to the land of the upper Creeks, with sufficient provisions to tide them over until they could establish themselves agriculturally. In his furor, Jackson readily agreed to this pact, and she departed with a letter to the commanding officer of Fort St. Marks detailing the agreement. This was, however, the last recorded sighting of her. She never upheld her end of the bargain, nor did she seek further assistance from General Jackson in the relocation of her people. McQueen was, indeed, never captured.","The Seminoles, including the unnamed woman, were directly related to the Creeks. They were in fact originally members of the Creek confederacy in Alabama and Georgia. They migrated to Florida, however, in three distinct phases. In the first half of the eighteenth century, they executed small invasions of Spanish territory, but with the intent to raid white villages, rather than to establish settlements of their own. In the second half of the century, they began establishing villages; by 1812, the Seminoles inhabited at least six towns in Spanish Florida. From 1812 to 1820, the political and cultural tensions in Georgia and Alabama led many Creeks to move to Florida and join the Seminoles already living there. So when the Seminole woman asked General Jackson to help her people move back to the upper Creek nation, she was not asking for him to help her people invade another tribe's land. She was just asking to go home.","This incident is also a clear indication of the growing power of Seminole women. From 1812 to 1820, they experienced a significant increase in their ability to exist formally outside of the household. With the migration of Seminoles to Florida, they came increasingly into contact with whites, allowing them to enter into small trade with them. These agricultural business transactions-primarily involving Seminole women growing and selling oranges, melons, corn, rice, and peaches to whites-greatly increased the political legitimacy of these women, thereby giving the unnamed woman the authority to strike her deal with a general in the United States Army."],"display_date":"April 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-04-18","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2337,"title":"Sam Forwood&#39;s Fatherly Advice\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-10-08","end_date":"1846-10-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 8, 1846, in Clark County, Alabama, Sam Forwood wrote a letter to his sixteen-year-old son, William Stump Forwood, who was living in Maryland with his grandmother for schooling.Young William had been questioning what occupation he should pursue, and his father had several points of advice. Sam advised his son to pursue the profession of medicine. As Sam explained it, becoming a doctor would not prevent him from being a farmer. Rather, Sam found it vitally in your advantage to be acquainted with the science of medicine, and it is an easy profession to acquire. According to historian James Volo, the medical profession in the antebellum period thought of itself as knowledgeable and humanitarian, but its practitioners were neither selective in their methods nor well regulated by their fellows. Such methods were still based upon medieval concepts and home remedies. A country doctor-which William would be if he returned to Clark County, Alabama-was even less advanced in practical methods due to the lack to intellectual stimulation from living in rural areas. In other words, even though studying to become a doctor would be respectable and considered knowledgeable for William, it would still be an easy profession, as Sam stated, for him to acquire.","Sam Forwood's reasoning behind his advice was that he knew about the hardships that farmers in Alabama faced at the time. As William Rogers explains, in Alabama, one of the states making up the Cotton Kingdom, the fluctuation of cotton prices, the higher cost of purchasing goods in a protected market, and the lack of economic development and diversification contribute to the unsettled economic conditions that characterized the time. The uncertainty of farming - when it would rain, how much it would rain, etc. - dominated letters among antebellum southern planters. Sam Forwood himself exclaimed anxiety about his crop of cotton being small, yet hopefully highly priced. Focusing on another profession, William Forwood could ease his dependence on this lifestyle of ambiguity. Although doctors belonged to what would be considered the white elite class, they still depended upon the agricultural success of the Cotton Kingdom. Certainly, doctors were a very separate occupation, which only served to build up the resources in a local society. Nevertheless, such occupations still depended on Alabama's economic vitality, which undoubtedly depended on cotton. With this in mind, William could still find time for farming-that occupation upon which southern society hinged. William Forwood did take his father's advice. In 1848, he returned to Alabama to pursue the medical profession. Later on in life, he served as the president of the Clark County Medical Society and published several articles in medical journals."],"display_date":"October 8, 1846","search_date":"1846-10-08","locations":[{"id":78,"lat":31.6767353507,"lng":-87.8307270777,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2338,"title":"Alexander Allen&#39;s Essay on Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Alexander Allen was asked to write an essay on the Advantages and Disadvantages of Slavery at Franklin College, Alabama, which he attended during the late 1830s and early 1840s, his answers were based upon the society in which he was immersed for all of his life. First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2349,"title":"The Cycle of Sharecropping\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-01-09","end_date":"1889-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Widowed and with few options available to support herself, Dolly Lang, a black widow living in Falls County, Texas, signed a sharecropping contract with Mrs. V.C.

On September 27, 1895, an announcement ran in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> explaining the recent arrival of the boll weevil population to the United States. The species moved up from Mexico into certain areas of Texas and was wreaking havoc on cotton crops. The U.S. Agricultural Department considered the cotton boll weevil to be one of the most harmful pests to have existed in the United States. The boll weevil appeared to reproduce rapidly in some areas while in others, populations spread more slowly. Despite scientific studies which took place in Brownsville near the Rio Grande, no solution had yet been discovered to control the boll weevil population. They continued to make their home in cotton bolls, their only known habitat, and ruin cotton crops in Mexico and Texas.","After Texas cotton crops endured years of droughts and inclement weather, the boll weevil made its first appearance in Texas near Corpus Christi in the early 1890s. The boll weevil caused mass destruction in cotton crops as it fed on and laid its eggs in the fruiting structures of the cotton plant. Resistant to common insecticides of the time, boll weevil populations were able to spread across the entire state of Texas and eventually covered a vast area including North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In this region known as the Cotton Belt, the pest caused a decrease in cotton productivity over a period of thirty years.","While the boll weevil population fanned out across the region, its damages were most heavily concentrated in southern Texas. Prior to the Civil War, Texas had not been a high producer of cotton; in 1850, Texas had one of the smallest cotton crops in the South. Yet during the Civil War and leading up to the twentieth century, cotton production in Texas flourished and grew from 58 thousand bales produced in 1850 to 2,584 thousand in 1900 when it was a top cotton producer. As cotton production increased in Texas, the effects of the boll weevil became more far-reaching and added to the volatility farmers faced in the cotton industry. An official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture toured an area in southern Texas in 1894 and reported that around 90 percent of the cotton crop was damaged due to the boll weevil. Ten years later, one estimate revealed that 700,000 bales of cotton were ruined by the boll weevil population in one year, totaling costs of 42 million in Texas. Many southern states continue to work today to keep boll weevils and their capability of destruction under control."],"display_date":"September 27, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-27","locations":[{"id":12520,"lat":29.8870533163,"lng":-96.2779799564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUSTIN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2374,"title":"Crop Variation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-04-01","end_date":"1852-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was the middle of April and the time for planting crops in the Western Florida county of Leon. At Chemonnie Plantation, except for a small piece of ground near the southwest edge of the plantation, the crop was all planted. The crop referred to by John Evans, the plantation overseer, in his bi-monthly letter to the plantation owner George Noble Jones was the king-cotton. Having addressed the major crop on the lands, Evans's letter quickly proceeded on to other activities from previous two weeks. Since the old rice paddy was planted with cotton, a new pond had to be ditched and cleared for this year's rice crop. Trees had been cut down and sawed into a heap of nice fence. Some of the lumber was already being incorporated into the fence along the plantations road frontage. Evans had sheared all the sheep and neutered the lambs, but had not yet spayed the shoats. That, he promised, would happen in the coming week. Evans reported the team looked a little thin but would sure to gain the weight back now that all the plowing had been completed. Evans completed his assessment of livestock with an update on the status of a pregnant sow. Evans also addressed a concern voiced by Jones involving the ratio of corn to cotton. At Chemonnie, Evans had planted about 200 acres of corn and 250 acres of cotton. He reassured Jones it was a good decision given the amount of land, number of slaves and size of the team available. Evans closed his letter promising not to work the team too hard.","Though king cotton was the most highly valued crop produced on large southern plantations like Chemonnie, it was neither the only crop cultivated, nor necessarily the most important. Within this one letter, Evans mentioned the production of cotton, corn, oats, rice, lumber, pork and wool. Southern plantations, often portrayed as only producing cash staples such as, cotton, tobacco, rice, or sugar, produced a diverse array of goods. In Florida, especially in the newly settled lands, a plantation resembled a classic frontier farm more than an older, established plantation of the Upper South. However, even after a plantation became well established, owners, much like Jones, tried to make their operations as self-sufficient as possible. Most often this entailed producing as much of the food consumed on the farm as possible. Foods produced included grains like, wheat, barely, buck-wheat, rice, and corn. Vegetables grown consisted of potatoes, sweet potatoes, greens, squashes, and beans. Livestock for home consumption included, cattle, chickens, and hogs. In Florida the easiest and most often produced food crops were sweet potatoes, corn and pork. At Chemonnie's height, of the 771 acres of open land only 451 consisted of cotton.

The school aimed to enhance the labor skills of newly freed blacks. The state chartered 15,000 towards the school, but still needed more funds. The board of trustees purchased three hundred acres of land with an estimated worth of 2800 in yielded crops. Yet it did not yet have the bare essentials needed to function. Over 100 pupils attended the school, the rooms were not big enough to accommodate the students, and there were not enough farming instruments for the use of the school's manufacturing and mechanical branches. The board acknowledged Watkins's appeals and sent agents north to seek assistance and support. "," Seeking assistance in the North was necessary because support within their own state was not likely. After congress passed the fourteenth amendment granting citizenship to African Americans July of 1868, many Tennesseans became furious. Riots broke out. Radical conservatives established group aimed to terrorize African Americans called the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Robert Corlew reported that Troops were necessary to stop atrocious murders and numerous outrages which had been committed by violent and disloyal men. "," In response to such violent outcries, Congress worked fast to design the Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans survive among the chaos. They distributed food, supervised contracts, and established schools. This bureau offered government and abandoned land as a refuge and by December of 1968, already established the Manual Labor School in Rutherford, Tennessee. They created the school to help African Americans develop labor skills in order to function in society and intended to have enough classrooms as well as tools they could use for practice. Education was so popular among African Americans because they had never before had the opportunity to receive it. With such a large turnout of students, the original allotted funds for the school were not sufficient. "," Schools for African Americans in the South had trouble receiving sufficient funds because they were surrounded by so much opposition to their cause, yet the eagerness of African Americans to learn was the key to starting educational institutions. According to Stephen Hahn, the burdens of establishing and running schools fell chiefly to the freed people themselves. They had to pool their meager resources, rent or purchase a tract of land, build a schoolhouse, and hire a teacher. By 1867 African Americans composed about one-third of the teachers in freedman's schools, and was growing. Those dedicated to receiving more funds had to lobby to northerners for support. Republican leaders of the Freedman's bureau made great attempts to respond to the requests of the newly freed blacks, hoping to receive their votes once they learned about the voting process, but it was difficult because there just was not a lot of money to give.

Dirty and unshaven, his tattered, mismatched clothes belied his purpose. Much to the surprise of Sheridan, this raggedy character, whom Sheridan took for a vagabond, tried to sell him land. The man took offense at Sheridan's disbelief, but continued to push the sale of his land. After further questioning, Sheridan learned that the land, although in a good area of Texas, not only was not in cultivation, but also had not yet been cleared. ","Sheridan related this tale in his journal to show one of the problems that confronted a growing Texas: most of the land is in the possession of persons who do not possess a shilling & who consequently are unable to cultivate it. This was true because of the liberal land policy of Texas. The Texas Constitution of 1836 granted a league of land (4,428.4 acres) to heads of households and a labor of land (177 acres) to single men. Later the government also decided to give lands to veterans of the Texas Revolution and their families. With people owning large amounts of land, some who were poorer were unable to make use of all of it. Clearing land was time consuming, and if a man could not afford slaves to help him clear the land, it could easily go uncultivated.","A law of December 1837 produced another problem in Texas land policy. The law created land commissioners whose job was to give certificates to landowners allocating to them their legal amount of land. Once they had obtained their certificate, landowners had to have their land surveyed then approved by the land commission. Sam Houston had opposed this system because he said that it would open the door for fraudulent land certificates and claims to land, and he was right. There were many instances of fraud and shady dealing. The law also created a business for speculators. They would go out and locate the choicest land and obtain for themselves the certificate to this land, all before real settlers could move in. This left those in search of good land at the mercy of businessmen. Texas's generosity with land created opportunities both for eager settlers and slick speculators.

Sitting on the banks of the Deep River, the new Island Ford Manufacturing Company directly faced the Randolph Manufacturing Company.  In less than a year the handsome three-story building sprang up with capital of 14,000, and the company began by running 528 spindles.  It is no surprise that the local paper enthusiastically greeted the new factory and predicted it would be crowned with success, for the economy of Franklinville relied upon the textile industry.  Newspaper editors expected that the capital would increase quickly to 20,000, and that operating spindles would soon double in number.  ","The construction of an impressive cotton factory in North Carolina's Piedmont attests to the dominance of cotton and local efforts to capitalize on its production.  Franklinville was in many ways a suitable location for a cotton mill in North Carolina due to its relative proximity both to a source of falling water and the coastal region.  As North Carolina's Piedmont stretches south and west, increasing distances to markets made freight prohibitively expensive; Franklinville was successful because of its atypical location.","Despite the efforts of the planter class to industrialize the Old South, Stephen Goldfarb dismisses the few textile mills of North Carolina as almost insignificant in comparison to the major industrial areas of New England in antebellum America.  North Carolinians in 1848 had reason to celebrate industrial growth, but ultimately antebellum North Carolina would not process its cotton to the extent that rivaled Northern and international operations.  While the impressive amount of capital and infrastructure attest to optimism, North Carolina's cotton mills rarely exported their manufactures.  Factors including dismal transportation options and lack of capital limited cotton manufacturing to meeting local demands, especially before the arrival of railroads to most regions of North Carolina.  The new manufacturing company, nevertheless, testified to a burgeoning period of economic growth that aided North Carolina in undertaking certain internal improvements. Until the complete establishment of railroads after the Civil War, prohibitive distances between falling water that powered the mills and coastal seaports helped prevent Southerners in the Piedmont from rivaling Northern mills."],"display_date":"April 12, 1848","search_date":"1848-04-12","locations":[{"id":9736,"lat":35.7102732834,"lng":-79.8060567039,"zoom":9,"place":"RANDOLPH, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2426,"title":"1841 Harvest Impacts Southern Society as Whole\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-06-01","end_date":"1841-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["To most South Carolina planters, the weather was of utmost importance. They relied on nature to provide them with their livelihood, the planting of rice and other crops. Charles Heyward resided in Charleston for most of the year, but controlled many plantations outside of the city, including Rose Hill, Amsterdam, and Lewisburg Plantations. By 1860, he owned 471 slaves. Therefore, it was in his best interest to record a journal like the one he kept during the years 1835-1855. It was to his benefit to record patterns in the weather.","Heyward recorded that June and July of 1840 were unusually cold and rainy for the summer months, putting a strain on the crops. He noted that although this kind of weather was favorable in the city, it was detrimental to the countryside where his plantations were located. In addition, August was a very wet month, which injured many of the crops and forced an early and unfavorable harvest. The cotton crop was injured the most. In the South during this time, cotton reigned supreme among crops. For a cotton harvest to fail like this created economic alarm among South Carolinians and Southerners in general. The year 1841 did not bring a good harvest, either. In fact, Heyward noted that it brought the worst harvest the area had seen in years. Although it came in September that year, relatively on time, the rain arrived that year in conjunction with the excessive high tides, which crested the river banks and caused the harvest to be quite deplorable.","The weather was just one of many factors that caused Charleston's cotton exports to fall sixty percent between 1821 and 1842. Business was terrible in the Charleston cotton market. Reportedly, grass was growing in the streets by 1842. Charlestonians grew alarmed because each member of the city's society, from slave to wealthy planter had a stake in agriculture. Planters and their families had less money; slaves were treated worse because of the darkened moods of the planters and overseers. They tended to blame slaves for bad harvests since they were the ones working with the crops. It was up to publications like The Southern Agriculturist to help planters think through their options in an effort for agriculture to become profitable once again. Theodore Rosegarten's essay The Southern Agriculturist in an Age of Reform, highlights a society based on the riches of the harvest. Because planters were arguing about what was causing their problems, The Southern Agriculturist was created to help scientifically sort out the issues of the growing season.

Formal delegates to the convention were to be appointed by the governors of those states which held an interest in the cattle industry. The letter, which was signed by Wm. L. Black, chairman (and others), pointed out the government's inability to offer solutions or relief for the depressed condition of the cattle industry. Members of the cattle industry in Texas realized the deficiencies in the system could not be ameliorated without the united action of all those who had something at stake in the cattle industry. Specifically, the letter referenced the commercial problems the industry faced and the consequent desire for merchants and bankers to attend the convention and join the effort for improvement. Cattlemen were suffering as the industry lost money and it seemed that the little profit that did exist went into the hands of only a few. He asked the readers with this terrible depreciation in the value of our resources, it is any wonder that farmers are poor, and that the commercial industries of the West and Southwest are so paralyzed?","In response to the letter's appeal, delegates attended the convention on March 11, 12, and 13 of 1890. At the convention, delegates discussed the issues of the apparent railroad monopoly in shipping cattle and other challenges facing the industry. They also suggested measures that members of the cattle industry could take on their own accord, without having to wait on government action, to improve the current situation. Potential solutions included tariffs as well as an increase in the use of refrigerators and other actions which could reduce the immediate supply of beef and drive up prices.","Texas had long been a major player in the cattle industry; however, it was not until most of the Indian population was driven out of the area and barbed wire was developed that the industry was really able to operate in a systematic manner. Barbed wire, invented in 1874, made it possible for herds to be enclosed and for controlled breeding to take place. The new creation also ended the need for long cattle drives and helped put an end to Indian raids on the cattle. Indeed, the cattle boom existed to such a great extent that cattlemen often faced a problem of market saturation which drove down prices. Breeding was often moved to more northern states in an effort to spread out the supply. The delegates at the convention also pointed out that the invention of refrigeration provided one potential solution since it granted the ability to transport the meat to new markets before it spoiled.","As beef became a major food product, the national and international interest in cattle grew; this prompted the industry to transition from a market of individually-owned herds to a market of corporations, with investors based as far away as Europe. The development of closed range ranching altered the scene of the cattle industry and the Southwest as it grew in scope and productivity. The cattle industry eventually branched out to cover most of the United States, as evidenced by the fact that delegates at this particular convention represented such states as Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Colorado, Illinois and Wyoming. As the cattle industry became a major source of investment as well as an increasingly large source of meat products, it became a national and international interest and brought to light economic and agricultural issues that needed to be addressed."],"display_date":"March 11, 1890 - March 13, 1890","search_date":"1890-03-12","locations":[{"id":13232,"lat":32.7703945791,"lng":-97.2918801714,"zoom":9,"place":"TARRANT, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2433,"title":"First North Carolina State Fair\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-10-18","end_date":"1853-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Visitors filled every hotel and boarding house in Raleigh. Replete with music fanfares, banners, and daily crowds of over 4,000 people, North Carolina inaugurated its first-ever State Fair in Raleigh on Tuesday, October 18, 1853. Local newspapers hailed the watershed event as a triumph. For North Carolinians, it was as much a matter of state pride as agricultural interest. For years neighboring states had ridiculed North Carolina for its undeveloped agricultural infrastructure. Farmers, merchants, mechanics, entrepreneurs, artists and assorted people converged on the state capital to display and observe livestock, minerals, improved agricultural implements, carriages, and many other exhibitions of North Carolina enterprise. Auctions were held for livestock and implements. The <em>Raleigh Register</em> stated that it had never gloried more in the fact that we were a citizen of North Carolina, than when, on the opening of this Fair, we beheld the evidences of a greatness, prosperity, and progress... North Carolinians congratulated themselves not only with pride in their state's current achievements, but also with the anticipation of progress into a more enlightened future."," The Honorable A.W. Venable imbued the event with its sense of occasion in a well-received address to a large crowd. He began by placing arduous agricultural efforts in the context of Adam's fall from innocence in the Book of Genesis. He further connected farming to a daily awareness of an overruling Providence on whom farmers relied for their produce to grow. The core of the speech addressed the phenomenon of soil depletion and poor land management. In harsh terms, he challenged North Carolinian farmers to take responsibility for replenishing farmland and investing in the quality of their soil. Venable spoke of a growing change in this respect that would move farmers away from unsustainable practices which left base deserts of farms. The process of clearing, exhausting, and abandoning land was denounced. In another challenge to farmers, Venable requested their support for cheap methods of interstate transport that would allow better utilization of North Carolina's resources. "," North Carolina had been pejoratively called the Ireland of America in the earlier nineteenth century as a result of its agricultural under-development. Lacking many basic internal improvements like canals and good roads, farmers devoted considerable portions of their income to merely freighting their produce to markets. People along the coast received goods from Maryland by water less expensively than from the interior of their own state. Furthermore, the soil of the Old South had been depleted by monoculture nutrient-intensive cash crops with little replenishing fertilizer. Avery Craven deems the efforts of Venable's contemporaries as unsuccessful in the long-run. Despite Venable's exhortations, the optimal balance between immediate agricultural profits and soil conservation seems never to have been struck. While North Carolina's first State Fair offered an encouraging sense of economic development, it may not have been as effective in revolutionizing entrenched practices."],"display_date":"October 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-10-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2441,"title":"Letter to Thomas Butler Concerning Selling His Land in Woodruff County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-04-02","end_date":"1879-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The letter to Thomas Butler concerning his property holdings in Woodruff County, ","Arkansas was sent to him by his lawyer, J.

Butler's land has been leased to tenants through Davis's business for some ","period of time and Davis stated that it was making little progress economically for Butler. Davis ","made sure that Butler realized that this was the only offer he had received in quite some time for ","this piece of land and it was probable that this was going to be the only offer they would receive ","anytime soon. Davis told Butler that not only was the land in Woodruff County in very low ","demand but that land in the entire state of Arkansas was not selling at all.

The storm started slowly, with the rainfall increasing as morning approached. Rain fell steadily and consistently for days, so much so that flooding began to occur throughout central Alabama. Waters roared with such wrath that houses along situated along streams were swept away. The flooding caused nearly five million dollars in damage. ","The flooding not only damaged homes, but it also destroyed crops, particularly cotton and tobacco. Crop production that decreased during the Civil War, resumed as farmers returned from the battle fields to fields of their own. Many crops provided both sustenance and income for Alabamans. However, the flood of 1884 cut the cotton crop for the year by nearly forty thousand bales and set farmers back for the season. Due to minimal technology, only almanac's served as resources for predicting weather. To add insult to injury, a particular infestation of worms accompanied the flood of 1884, infiltrating cotton fields across Alabama making it virtually impossible to produce market-worthy cotton. State-wide production decreased by over five hundred thousand bales from 1860 to 1870. Cotton production bounced back, increasing 196 percent to 299, 814 pounds by 1880. The Great Flood of 1884 set all progress back. ","Called the Great Southern Staple, Cotton was king.

One letter, written by An Eastern Virginian to <em>The Lynchburg Virginian</em> in 1854, stressed the vital need to fix the railways running between Norfolk and the Valley of Ohio. Though transporting goods to the Valley of Ohio was possible, the route was extremely difficult due to the railway's lack of gauge uniformity. Norfolk's neglect to correct this problem greatly diminished its export potential. The current railway route was divided into five separate sections that totaled 520 miles. Very inefficient when hauling large loads, the divided railway needed to be unified. An Eastern Virginian was convinced that the commercial prosperity of the entire state hinged on this railroad. Since Virginia was experiencing an economic slump, the state's revival rested on the shoulders of the Norfolk line. Due to the Norfolk railways' present state, Baltimore and the North were shipping all of the goods to the West. An Eastern Virginian found this despicable and intolerable. If gauge uniformity were achieved, economic prosperity could be shifted back to Norfolk and Virginia. The Eastern Virginian even set out future plans to connect Norfolk's rail system to St. Louis, Louisville, and Memphis. Furthermore, the Eastern Virginian even discussed the advantages of the railway as a great military road, as it would create a direct route through the heart of the Union to the West."," The improvement of Norfolk's and Virginia's rail systems was a necessity to help boost the lagging economy. Inferior to other Northern and Western railway systems, the Norfolk line and many other Southern railways were unable to transport goods at a profitable level. The problem stemmed from the economic depressions that hit the nation. The depression of 1839 and the crop shortages of 1846, 1847, 1850, and 1851 greatly affected the South's agricultural output. Since the Southern economy depended on agricultural sales, the shortages hit the South much harder than the industrially dependent North. During these hard times, as the other railways grew and improved, Southern railways remained stagnant. Another problem that slowed Southern railway development was a lack of engineers. Engineers were scarce during wartime, as the Union shipped them to aid in the Mexican-American War. By the time they were released, the South was still in economic depression, and was unable to find the capital for railways. Meanwhile, the North and West had high-capital projects waiting to be constructed, and thus hired the engineers. When the South came out of its depression, it was essentially a decade behind the North technologically. This further hurt the railways' development, as Southerners often built their railroads with glaring technical flaws (such as Norfolk's gauge problem). The need to improve Southern railways was a significant task during the mid-nineteenth century. The South's inefficient rail system, caused by the effects of economic depression, hindered the development of Southern trade."],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2511,"title":"Nullification Controversy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1833-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As early as 1830, three years before the Nullification Compromise, South Carolinians in the coastal Georgetown area became agitated with raised tariffs.  This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2515,"title":"Wilmington Port Activity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As of May 1815, the port of Wilmington, North Carolina, albeit small, was a bustling commercial center and exported a wide range of produce. Joshua Potts wrote about the state of the port for posterity and reported the following: Wilmington traded primarily with the West India Islands and the Northern United States, particularly New York.  The market opened in November, gained momentum from December through March.  It slackened in April and May and terminated in June, making the summer and fall months dull.  Excellent crops of various kinds were cultivated annually including:tobacco, cotton, rice, flour, corn, tar, turpentine, flaxseed, lumber, staves, bacon, butter, beeswax, brandies, whiskeys, beef, corn meal, pork, lard, tallow, deer skins, pees, live stock, pitch, and rosin. Potts's account bore witness to a period of great commercial growth in Wilmington at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  Not only was foreign trade on the rise, but citizens were also increasingly engaged in new ventures.  The First Presbyterian Church erected its first building in 1818, and in the same year, editor David Smith began publishing the Cape Fear Recorder. Historian William Dusinberre contradicts Potts's claim to Wilmington's substantive rice exportation.  The early 1820s bore lower rice production than the peak it had reached thirty years earlier as well as twenty years afterwards.  It wasn't until 1825 that rice planters began to recover from Jefferson's embargo and the War of 1812.

One hundred and thirty slaves appeared for the division, faces plastered with looks of terror.  In a classic rationalization of a slave master, Robert's mother wrote, I feel for them, but it is evident they all cannot belong to me.  By the time Roberts younger brother and mother died, Robert had inherited a total of 33 slaves and half of Chicora Wood, 370 acres of uncultivated land suitable for the agriculture of rice.  By 1834, he found himself managing all of his father's once-divided lands and cultivating the affection of his wealthy aunt who would visit him and bring her own barouche, horses, coachman and footman, and her own maid and laundress.  She later bequeathed to Robert a valuable Waccamaw rice plantation and 97 slaves, setting him up to become one of the most skillful managers in the rice kingdom.Timing is everything.  Robert acquired most of his land between 1819 and 1835, a time of relatively low rice productivity due to the mid-nineteenth-century cotton boom.  Thus, he learned the tricks of the trade at an optimal time in agricultural history and was an expert by the time the crop peaked, causing him to have some of the highest rice yields in all of the Coastal Carolinas. Historian William Dusinberre traced particular elements leading to Roberts financial success.  Robert spent four years at West Point, where he was educated in both military discipline and surveying.  After serving four years as South Carolina's surveyor general, he took up the full-scale management of his plantation in 1827 and used his surveying skills to stake out claims to the uncultivated areas of his plantation.

Edward Marshall was the son of Chief Justice John Marshall.

Horticulturist, W. G. Fraser spent four weeks in the South during the winter of 1900 testing a new market for Californian oranges. Upon returning to California he reported to the <em>Los Angeles Daily Times</em>, The result of my trip was most satisfactory. I found a very active demand for California fruit... Fraser attributed this demand to the remarkable prosperity of the South giving the citizens the purchasing power needed to facilitate exportation of California produce. The Birmingham economy was of considerable interest to Fraser. He noted, In Alabama, especially, was the industrial activity great. At Birmingham the iron works have government contracts that keep them employed for two years. The skilled operatives earn from 4 to 16 per day. Extrapolating from these estimates, Fraser deemed the Birmingham market worth cultivating. Upon seeing the profitability and stability of the Birmingham iron industry, Fraser only expressed regret that this market had not been studied and served earlier. "," Birmingham's economy was booming at the turn of the twentieth century. By 1899, Alabama's iron industry produced more than twice that of her nearest rivals, Tennessee and Virginia combined. Fraser's account of Birmingham's industrial success was only one of many that were narrated in newspapers at the end of the century. The tale of Birmingham and the greater Alabama industrial revolution remain integral to the state's history. In the mid-1880s Tennessee Coal Iron and Railway Company supported Birmingham's industry and the city soon left all southern competitors in the dust. However, as Fraser applauded the economic success of Birmingham, the iron capital of the South faced an industrial decline. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, [Alabama's] need for vast sums of capital outside the South...conspired to keep Birmingham from attaining what had seemed so close at hand in the early 1890s. The capital that did flow into Birmingham went directly into the production of pig iron and relied upon Northern investment. This capital did not directly enhance the personal wealth of the Birmingham labor force as Fraser suggested. The labor forces of the Birmingham iron industry, while comparably compensated to northern employees, engaged in backbreaking work for marginal personal gain. Additionally, according to Ayers, the volume of cheap labor that flocked to the industrial capital of Birmingham stunted the city's need for technological advancement. With little need to adopt labor saving technology in Birmingham, the city fell behind to northern competitors willing to update their systems. Fraser was correct in mourning California's past oversight of a new fruit market in Birmingham. Yet, Fraser visited the South approximately five years too late to capitalize on the southern industrial revolution.

Describing his marble tomb to be placed beside a similar one already sculpted for his wife on his 12 mile plantation, Hagood continued to allocate his surviving money to pay his debts and to divide the remaining within his five children, Mary, Lucie, Fannie, William and Benjamin. The daughters were to share the base plantation and all attached lands and stock amongst themselves. Fannie was also to receive the family house and lots in Pickens, where Hagood was writing his last testament. All of the land north of the Road was to go to Benjamin Holder while the other half would go to his daughter Virginia Bruce. Lucie would also receive the Folger house and lots in Pickens while also receiving three other lots at about two acres apiece. Hagood continued dividing up the family lands between his surviving children; he concluded his will by appointing his two sons as executors and stating that he wished for all of children to share an equal amount of land.","   While Hagood?s will shows the immediate results of a patriarch's death on the post-bellum plantation; we can also see how land was divided to accommodate every family member. Across the South Carolina upcountry, agriculture was based on a premise of partible inheritance; as a father died, it was expected that his children, especially the sons, were to receive acres of land to cultivate. Hagood gives his children shares of his property; however, the fact that lands had begun to dwindle by the post-Reconstruction era is present in how some gifts were spread across distances, not allowing the consolidation of plots into plantations. Ideally, the family attempted to consolidate individual farms to maintain a single, large plantation consisting of personal farming areas.","   According to Edward Ayers, plantation owners were faced with a new reality in the South after the Civil War. The average size of farms was shrinking annually as parents continued to divide their personal lands between their children. As less land was available, families were forced either to move from the plantation or to work together as a unit while employing the newly freed African Americans. Roger Shugg addresses South Carolinian economic metamorphosis in the 1880s and 1890s as he describes how several individual farms on a plantation could then be allotted to the care of freedmen. He describes how despite the change toward a division of plantations' required labor between white and black laborers, the white plantation owners still had control over their land. Hagood's will directly relates to the new economic problems of the time period as the limited supply of land left on the plantation was divided up between his children; furthermore, it relates to the practice of consolidating individual farms into a familial plantation in order to use freedmen as a labor source."],"display_date":"September 11, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-11","locations":[{"id":11632,"lat":34.890972656,"lng":-82.7237397115,"zoom":9,"place":"PICKENS, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2561,"title":"The Civil War on Civilians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-05","end_date":"1865-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was a humiliating experience for Louisa Minor. The Union troops arrived at her home and stole guns, clothing, bonds, and the watches from two slaves, Sue and Mammy E. Louisa was so alarmed at their behavior that she was afraid for her safety. She found Union officers who protected her, but the threat of violence from Union soldiers was real. Louisa Minor experienced fear that day felt all over the South as Union and Confederate troops passed through widespread communities. Like others, Louisa Minor remained defiant.","The destructive force the war had for civilians surfaced as early as in Fredericksburg, Virginia between December 11 and 15 1862. Fredericksburg had been occupied by Confederate sharpshooters slowing the Union advance, so the Union troops probably felt justified in their action. Looting in the town occurred to a severe degree as the entire contents of houses was thrown into the street. The greatest loss felt by southern women like Louisa Minor was the loss of loved ones on the battlefield. Among Virginians alone, 20-30,000 men died in the war, while by 1862 alone there were 42,000 claims for back-pay by families of deceased soldiers. The suffering and fear felt by Louisa Minor and her family in Albemarle County was just a small part of the broader suffering the war brought to American civilians.","Louisa Minor's personal humiliation at the hands of Union troops repeated itself all across the Confederacy, as the movements of Union and Confederate armies initiated destruction of civilian property from Virginia to Louisiana. In Virginia, Gen. Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 devastated that area's ability to provide food for the Confederacy. Sheridan waged war on the ability of the Confederate population to resist, a method emulated all over the Confederacy by Union forces. Significant resistance by Confederate guerillas forced Sheridan to be even more extreme. Between late September and late October 1864 Sheridan systematically destroyed the Shenandoah Valley's ability to feed Confederate troops. Far from Virginia Benjamin Butler brought the war to the doorstep of Confederate civilians early in the Civil War by confiscating private property in New Orleans after the Union took that city in 1862. Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's offensive into northern Alabama in 1864 was actually more severe than Sherman's in Georgia though it achieved less renown. Confederate units and deserters from both sides also inflicted severe hardship on the Confederate civilian population. When Louisa Minor's property was taken from her in early 1865, she became one more of the many thousands like her who had experienced the full destructive force of the Civil War.

The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

If Ella never married, Mrs. Rives wished for her to live with one of her brothers. Mrs. Rives also wanted Castle Hill, her home, to remain in the family. Near the end of her will, Mrs. Rives named her three sons as her executors.","During the nineteenth century wealthy people like Mrs. Rives usually bequeathed significant sums to their daughters to care for their wellbeing until marriage. Mrs. Rives gave land to her daughter Ella but less than she gave to her son Alfred. This begs the question of whether Mrs. Rives made this decision for personal or economic reasons. At that time few Women's Property Laws existed in Virginia. Thus Mrs. Rives may have wished to keep most of the family land securely in male hands when she wrote her will. Her will is significant because it demonstrates the complexities of women's property in the Virginia legal system before the passage of Women's Property Laws. The Virginia legislature did not a pass a full Married Women's Act until 1877. By 1875, the year Judith Rives wrote her will, there was only a preliminary law in place protecting a wife's pre-matrimonial property from her husband's creditors. Thus, though progress had been made for women's property rights by the time of Mrs. Rives wrote her will, leaving land in her daughters hands have could still resulted in the loss of that property to her daughter's future husband.

The total crop for the year for all four men was worth 2,033 dollars  Mr. Bills took 515 dollars for rent, or  twenty five percent of the four men's total crop.   These landless tenants had no choice but to accept the high rent that Bills offered.  Instead of growing his own crops, Bills relied on his dozens of tenants to farm his thousand acres and provide his substantial income.  While Bills returned comfortably to his home, his white and black tenants faced the  bleak economic reality of declining cotton prices. "," Unlike a crop-lien system, Bills charged a flat rate rent in order to reduce the risks associated with tenant farmers. The trend continued on a regional level in Georgia where the number of cash tenants grew from 18,000 in 1880 to 59,000 in 1900. At nearly seventy years old, Bills was too old to oversee that tenants properly tended to the cotton fields.  Although it seemed like a lucrative business, landowners found it difficult to keep tenants because farms competed for the lowest rent.  Heavily indebted tenants could leave unexpectedly without paying for goods that Bills provided.   With cash tenants, landowners did not need to keep a store or furnish any goods.   Landowners increasingly avoided the crop-lien system, as they did not want their tenants to rely on them for food to feed their families. Tenants knew how much they had to produce to meet their rent and landowners could isolate themselves from the harsh realities of tenant farming.  Since landowners did not have any personal stake in the success of their tenants, Bills could retire to a leisurely life of hunting and fishing instead of supervising the farm. ","Lower commodity prices caused by overproduction after the Civil War made farming a difficult life for  landless African Americans and whites.  More efficient cotton processing and new farming methods flooded the European and northern markets with cotton, corn and tobacco causing commodity prices to plummet.  Still, agriculture was firmly ingrained into the landscape of the South  for generations and industrial opportunities were scarce.   Recently emancipated African Americans with little education turned to the familiar cotton farming of the antebellum period. The lack of affordable land forced both white and black landless farmers  to accept high rent.  If there were blight or an early frost, tenant farmers risked not having enough money to feed their families. ","White landowners had a complicated relationship among white and black tenants.  If both the tenant and the owner were white, they enjoyed a closer relationship than with African Americans.  Landowners would often work aggressively to help their white tenants to succeed while having little contact with black tenants.  Black and white tenant farmers developed tensions when they competed for the best crops and the best land.  Whites especially resented successful black farmers who challenged white supremacy.  Even though believed they were racially superior to black tenant farmers, they were on the same economic ground.  In many ways tenant farming placed whites and blacks on equal ground.

On January 11, 1868, HarpWeek published a two-picture political cartoon entitled The Pleasure of Tobacco. The first picture featured a young man in bed enjoying his pipe. The caption under the drawing said, To which young and promising Tom Smudger abandons himself. He wasteth the midnight oil. Quantities of Killikinick, and himself simultaneously. However, the second picture is a casket covered in a sheet with a pipe on top. The casket is resting in the grass of the graveyard; captioned Smudge becomes a martyr to his Love, and the Object of the Devotion is buried with him. This cartoon warned against the fatal consequences of smoking tobacco. "," George William Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly, used to smoke himself but stopped in the 50s. In 1867, he submitted his own editorial to warn his readers of the negative effects of tobacco use on their health. He said that tobacco contained poisons that were harmful to our bodies and that if we quit, we will soon feel in better health. The deadly politics of tobacco was certainly a struggle- on one hand it was the second most profitable cash crop in the South, but on the other, people were dying from it as well. "," HarpWeek published many advertisements for tobacco products as well as those for quit and get fit campaigns. But in the man while people die prematurely of palsy of the heart, cancerous stomachs, and diseased lungs from its excessive use; and they will continue to do so if half the world is depopulated by this vegetable tyrant. Lack of scientific evidence regarding tobacco's harmful effects caused much controversy over the topic. Some claimed that everything in moderation was fine, including tobacco use and that it in no way could be linked to disease. "," Even the last great tax on the luxury of cigars and pigtail, by Congress, which seemed likely to limit its consumption, has had no more effect than beating an elephant with a feather. Efforts were made by governments across the country to tax tobacco more heavily in hopes to reduce its widespread usage; however, it's use continued to only expand. Some saw tobacco as a drug, a killer, and others as just something to do to pass the time. Even a hundred years before Surgeon General warnings, we already had begun to understand tobacco's effects. "," Tobacco was more prevalently grown during the colonial period, than during the years after the Civil War, but it certainly had not disappeared from the scene. Seventy-five percent of cotton came from plantations along with other crops such as sugar, rice and tobacco. Richmond was one of the largest producers of tobacco in the world during this time. The slave trade experienced increased activity and more profitability than any other time thus far and therefore provided even more labor for fieldwork. The new railroads connecting the rest of the country also allowed tobacco to be traded and sold great distances. Tobacco remained a very important cash crop in North Carolina and Kentucky. Meanwhile plantations in Virginia and Maryland were not so fortunate; they suffered from depleted soil and decreasing profits. "," Tobacco was an extremely soil depleting crop. While plantations thrived, small farmers were hard pressed for money for such large-scale productions. They would often plant small plots of lower quality tobacco and rotate with other crops like sweet potatoes and cowpeas to allow the soils to recoup. These small farmers rarely could afford to own slaves because prices had sky rocketed in upwards of 2,000 a slave. In order for plantations to succeed, planters not only had to have plenty of acreage but enough cheap labor to work it. Needless to say, the plantation economy was not the norm for most southern whites but was responsible for the production of the majority of tobacco for the entire nation. "," The years preceding the war, cigarettes became the most popular form of tobacco- both hand rolled and machine rolled. The tobacco industry continued to boom from Virginia all the way down to Georgia. Durham and Winston-Salem North Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky, and Richmond, Virginia became major centers for cigarette production and brought wealth to the areas. The invention of the cigarette rolling-machine and the manufacture of cigarettes so close to home increased the demand for the plant immensely. Annual national per capita consumption rose from 1.5 pounds in 1860 to 5.5 pounds in 1900, a 267 percent rise.

This license enabled Mr. Austin to distill from domestic materials for one week only. The rules set forth by this license were issued by the United States, not the state of Virginia. Mr. Austin's license shows how alcohol was an important part of the social scene of the South. According to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the South has always been into heavy drinking, even when Virginia was only a colony, and the colonists heavily on many occasions. Southerners were also known for the variety of drinks that they consumed. Wilson and Ferris explain that brandies were made from apples, peaches, pears, and other local fruit...imported wines/ graced wealthy tables...

After the Revolution, molasses became expensive, and whiskey became the major drink of the South."," The Upper South, including Buckingham County, became a region for distilling bourbon which was distilled from corn, a crop which grew well in this region. Whiskey stayed as the prominent drink of the South until the mid twentieth century. Many settlers illegally distilled alcohol on the frontier of the South. Because alcohol was a large part of life in the South, the residents experienced both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, alcohol became the social beverage to most in the South. Whether it was beer at a small farmer's get together or wine at a wealthy planter's dinner party, alcohol became the drink of the social scene in the antebellum South. On the negative side, alcohol brought about widespread alcoholism and violence. "," The negative effects of widespread alcohol use became the main motives for the temperance movements throughout the nineteenth century. The temperance movement took a while to gain a hold in the South, but the religious revivals helped this movement gain momentum. Some townspeople supported this movement, included those strongly influenced by the religious revivals, but they were strongly outnumbered by the alcohol supporters. The wealthy planters still enjoyed drinking as a social activity. Small farmers benefited economically from distilling. The temperance movement of the early nineteenth century accounted for 44 percent of the population of the country, but only eight percent of the South; none of the southern states adopted prohibition in this time period.  Many immigrants had settled in the South along the frontier, making this issue strongly divided among the North and the South; these immigrants came from backgrounds where drinking was a dominate part of their culture. Many of these immigrants had settled along Virginia's frontier, making Virginia a wet state where alcohol supporters outnumbered prohibition supporters.

Being located along a river and along a railway line, he saw that cotton production proved to be very prosperous for those in Augusta because they could easily ship their products throughout the nation. Along with the cotton factories, he noticed that there were flour mills and tobacco factories taking advantage of the transportation and opportunities for their products. He commented that there was a greater use of fertilizers to increase the production of cotton. According to the traveler, the farmers used much of the white labor source because the African Americans worked well only if paid well.","Fertilizers were used in greater quantities in order to produce more cotton to trade in on the cash value of the crop. The land used was not productive enough for their needs or had been neglected previous to the high production of cotton, as the historian Lewis Nicholas Wynne argued. He found evidence of people in that time commenting that land without fertilizers 'would not produce over one-eighth or one-tenth of a bale.' The overproduction of cotton lowered the demand for it and lowered the price that farmers received for growing it. Because farmers had to produce cotton to satisfy merchants in the crop lien system, Wynne found that farmers increase[ed] production in order to offset lost income, while really just making the situation worse and reducing their incomes in the long run. The economy was worsened by this seemingly unending system of the overproduction of cotton.","The use of white labor instead of African American labor shows that reliable black labor may have been difficult to find. After receiving freedom from the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War, African Americans sought to assert freedom in their lives. One way that they could have control over their lives was to choose their own way to work. The writing of R. Tracy McKenzie shows that the historian Sharon Ann Holt made a claim to this effect saying that freed people made a freedom for themselves.

A local store would have been profitable for Maupin since so many people just produced cash crops and bought necessities from their towns. The crop lien system was a major part of Southern agricultural society. Lewis Nicholas Wynne found that merchants could allow people to buy products necessary for farming and also daily necessities by charging a high credit price and getting a portion of the cotton crops to cash in at the end of the season. Merchants played an important role in how agriculture turned out in the South. They forced farmers to produce cash crops even when the return prices dropped very low. People could not produce crops for subsistence and merely worked for the cash crops. According to Jeanette Keith, merchants could have made an even larger profit than what they were making by taking advantage of uneducated farmers who did not know that they were paying more than necessary. Thus, it would have been very profitable to be a local merchant and would entice those with enough money to invest in it. ","It is not surprising that Maupin's young wife went back to live with her parents after his death. According to sermons from the time that Edward Ayers found, men were expected to provide for and protect their wives while the women took care of the home. Since Maupin's wife would have depended on him economically, she would not have had the means to care for herself when he died. Since women did not provide for themselves, it was important for them to get married. Ayers also found letters that encouraged young women to get married and start their own families.

The deed needed to be witnessed, signed, and sealed. The land was 132 acres and all the boundaries were listed. Land was essential in social standing and those with land were of higher class than those who weren't even if they were of different races. "," Land not only provided social standing, but it also was vital to the economy of the South. According to Edward Ayers, ideally a farmer of either race was able to work his way up the 'agricultural ladder' from landless laborer to sharecropper to renter to landowner. There were many ways to acquire land; like Archer Williams, it could be handed down within a family. An adolescent boy could also move to a landowner's farm to learn the practices of running of a farm, prove that he is a dependable worker, and earn a daily wage. Once he earned the trust of his employer or another landowner, he could become a sharecropper. Sharecroppers had responsibility for a plot of land and could earn money on their crops from the local market. Renters, on the other hand, paid for the use of a plot of land, provided their own tools and work animals, and could plant any crops they desired. They risked the possible losses, however. Once either the sharecropper or the renter saved enough, they could buy their own farm. No matter which way the farmer acquired his land, his main goal was to have his own farm."," Agriculture and crops were a major source of income for many Southerners. More and more blacks were acquiring land, and by 1900 although still many more whites had farms, 45 percent of blacks had land along the coasts, compared to the 70 percent of whites. The usage of land was different depending on its location and its environment. In the lower south, including Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains and also Southern Virginia, the area was the best suited for agricultural purposes. On the Eastern shore after the Civil War, farmers diversified their crops, so that if a crop failed that year, it did not mean that they would suffer incredibly. This trend was common all over the South after the war.

He also reminded the farmers to make sure they were rotating their crops so they were not depleting the soil of the nutrients they were attempting to restore. Next to God, he pointed out, agriculture was a vital part of human life, especially in the South.

Many were pushing aside interests in agriculture at the same time that self-reliance and independence were becoming more important for the individual farmers. Things had gotten so bad that the governments had to step in and they were proposing remedies, new techniques of farming, and advising the farmers on improving their attitudes in regards to farming. As Perman points out, when the government got involved with agriculture, especially the Democratic Party, claiming that cultivation had to become more efficient and more up to date, even things like elections were influenced over the issue of agriculture. Since the Democratic leaders were perceived as better at advising farmers on these techniques to improve their farming methods, the farmers who followed this advice began to actually see change, and this influenced them to vote for the Democratic Party.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O.

Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence. This poor white man complained that his crops just began growing, but he was too poor and weak to fix the fence, whose destruction meant starvation for himself and his family."," Both Bundy and a Confederate officer felt sympathy for this man, saying so to the men stealing the wood. The Confederate officer explained the problematic nature of this situation, professing, Our people only know one part of making war. They known how to fight, and that's all. The southern men have no business faculty. Although this officer requested supplies many times, his soldiers were naked and starving in their own homeland, the South. Bundy and the Rebel officer agreed upon the injustice of taking from an impoverished family.

Expectedly, his situation worsened during the years of economic decline of in a nation at war, as John B. Boles describes. The extreme poverty suffered by a large portion of southerners during the Civil War was horrifying to this northern man. He and his enemy, a Confederate officer, shared the same opinion on the poor white southerner's situation: it was unfair for a quartermaster to destroy a family to attain a few pieces of wood. According to Boles, towards the end of the war, however, conditions worsened for soldiers and civilians alike, as the economy continued to deteriorate through a lack of Confederate economic policy. Boles illuminates families' struggles with starvation, and conquering Union troops, embittered too by the continuing war, made fewer exemptions for civilians, feeling less guilt at taking fence rails and other amenities. Bundy and his comrades were en route to finalize surrender by the Louisiana armies and still civilians suffered at the hand of apathetic officials. Bundy, unable to forget the unfortunate fate of this family, witnessed a typical tragedy throughout the poverty-stricken South, a family unable to sustain itself and apathy of exhausted officials.

In this particular letter, Mr. Hudson had finally gotten around to planting his cotton and he still intended to plant more cotton among the other things he was cultivating. Despite his general complaints about the weather, like the rain and his difficulty with getting the planting done as well as getting into town, Mr. Hudson seemed to be in good health as was his family. He discovered in this letter as well that Hudson was not going to be going into town quite as frequently as before because of the lack of service provided by the mail system so he would not be picking up his correspondence quite as frequently.

For example, in Hudson's life, without slaves, planting and agriculture took over most aspects of his life. He became much more conscious of the weather patterns to the point that he began informing his friends about those in correspondence. As many farmers were feeling the same pressures Mr. Hudson was facing where agriculture dominated their lives, organizations like the Agricultural Wheel or the Farmer's Alliance developed. These groups claimed to stand for the interests of small producers and drew on the political support of the Greenbackers. Both of these institutions attempted to improve the farmer's standing in the competitive marketplace. Michael Holt says that even though these institutions excluded blacks, the blacks were also able to mobilize on their own to achieve some of the same things in the field of agriculture.

McDowell's plow struck the side of a heavy object and he dug through the ground to discover a burnt clay sepulchre. He pulled a small portion of an arm out of the dirt and waited for a scientist to properly disinter the entire sepulchre. The sepulchre was a long slab, almost seven feet long and four feet wide and the underside held the complete cast of a human body. McDowell surmised that a people group in the distant past had buried the sepulchres in shallow graves, covered the bodies with clay, and piled wood upon them to consume them with fire. As a result, the burnt clay sepulchres became hardened slabs. McDowell found several similar sepulchres several years earlier when he first farmed his land in Macon  County, but he destroyed the relics through plowing his field. Initially, no Native American scholars trusted the authenticity of McDowell's discovery, as they did not believe Native Americans buried their dead in such a manner. Nevertheless, McDowell's discovery of the sepulchres in 1872 proved the validity of his find. ","McDowell acquired his Macon County land in 1821 after Cherokee Indian communities abandoned the region due to white American expansionism. In a letter to the Scientific American, McDowell emphasized the pleasure he experienced when he first acquired his own land, expressing the spirit of romance he felt when pioneering his small farm. McDowell greatly benefited from the removal of the Cherokee natives from North   Carolina and expressed great interest in their practices.","Historian Steven Conn argues that mid to late nineteenth-century historians developed interest in the study of prehistory and formed the belief that Native Americans were living examples of prehistory. The academic scholarship in late nineteenth-century America began to treat Native Americans as objects of anthropological science. However, the late nineteenth-century historical movement concurrently served to write Native Americans out of the romantic narrative of American history. Thus, Native Americans were treasured for their ability to provide glimpses into the deep American past and were simultaneously removed from the American historical future because of their inability to fit into the white majority's view of American identity. McDowell's story supports Conn's view of the dichotomous treatment of Native Americans. McDowell prized the importance of the Indian sepulchres he discovered, and yet, felt blessed by the land he acquired from the Cherokees' migration in the early eighteenth century. McDowell failed to recognize the dichotomy that existed between his passion for ancient Indian artifacts and the personal benefits he obtained through the oppression of Native Americans."],"display_date":"June 16, 1872","search_date":"1872-06-16","locations":[{"id":9598,"lat":35.237570606,"lng":-83.4949345538,"zoom":9,"place":"MACON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2778,"title":"The New Textile Industry in Athens, Georgia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-11","end_date":"1849-01-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Cotton farming had reached great heights in Georgia by the mid-1800's but some saw that there was still room to grow in the cotton business. Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

Logie went before a large gathering of farmers and cotton-growers in the Charlotte and proposed an organization of all cotton-farmers in the area. Under this association, farmers would pool their entire product of that year's growth, sell it as one, and share the dividends. This group would be headed by an elected congress of representative farmers who would create a constitution and by-laws for the agency, which would then create chapters in every state. Each state would be under the same management in terms of buying and selling, and all would be under the direction of the central board of control. "," While it is unknown if Logie obtained much support for his proposal, other alliances between farmers were very popular at this time and experienced much success, both economically and even in the political arena. Charlotte was considered to be one of the predominant Southern towns in the cotton industry. However, throughout the 1880s, agricultural depression had run deeply throughout North Carolina, causing many farmers to declare bankruptcy. Therefore, it is not surprising that Logie decided to propose his plan in this city, where he would find a large concentration of cotton-farmers also wondering at how to improve their economic means. The Farmer's Alliance, an organization founded by a group of farmers in Texas in response to the economic depression that ensued after the Civil War, had been increasing in size and popularity at this time, which likely inspired Logie to suggest a very similar society of farmers. "," The goal of the Farmer's Alliance was to increase the prices of their commodities through collective action in groups of individual farmers, which can be seen in Logie's proposal. The association quickly flourished and began establishing chapters throughout the south that helped white farmers buy goods at wholesale and sell their produce without having to pay a middleman. The organization eventually became involved in politics, and the alliance was later reborn as the Populist Party, centering on the same platform of government control of transportation and communication (which would help curb the powers of monopolies), as well as reforms of currency, land ownership, and tax policies. While historian Robert Hinton noted the ultimate failure of the Farmer's Alliance as an economic movement, their influence throughout the south, both agriculturally and politically, must be recognized as an inspiration to people like Logie who also desired to employ those tactics and attempt to improve the conditions of rural farmers.

The Salisbury Truth article was composed of statements and facts gathered by a person who has given the subject a great deal of thought. The piece described how, with the help of modern machinery, one man and his two sons were able to complete work that had required 11,000 spinners only a few years ago, while another man was able to do the work of 50 weavers at once. Other machines had greatly affected the amount of labor needed to execute certain tasks, such as cotton printing machines, which had reduced hand labor by 1500 percent, and log sawing machines, which fostered the unemployment of 499 men out of 500. In the manufacturing of paper, the article reported that 95 percent of hand labor had been replaced, and by the use of machinery in loading and unloading ships, one man could do the work of 2000. "," While it is unknown whether these statistics are in fact correct, what they reveal is the profound effect mechanization had upon the South at this time. The author's wonder and admiration at the capabilities of this equipment was profound and sincere, and he predicted correctly that such devices would only improve in number and quality over time. In a society intensely focused on agriculture in particular, these machines were miraculous for the amount of time they saved and the efficiency in which they completed some of the most grueling and labor-intensive tasks. "," The effect these devices had on the South was profound. In previous decades, North Carolina had lagged behind other southern states in agricultural productivity and economic means; Mississippi and Alabama were the only states that ranked lower. However, from 1880-1900, textile manufacturing increased dramatically, along with the development of new railroads, highways, educational institutions, banks, and tobacco factories. These economic advancements were fairly unique to North Carolina compared with other southern states, claims historian Dwight Billings, making it known throughout the South for its progressiveness in the era of the Second Industrial Revolution. However, the effects of labor-saving machinery could be felt throughout the South, inspiring improvements in communication, transportation, and productivity. Those developments brought many rural people into Southern cities to work at mills and factories, and before long, a strong and substantial middle class had emerged.

Green knew that there was a future in the manufacturing of tobacco because he noticed the extensive amount of its consumption in the Confederate Army and among university students. Green focused on the manufacture of smoking tobacco by buying only the best grades of leaf. Later that year, a terrible incident turned out to be a blessing for him. The Confederate Army, while withdrawing through Durham, acquainted Green's tobacco with the Federals. The soldiers raided the factory, and Mr. Green assumed his business was ruined. However, they quickly acquired an appreciation for Spanish Flavored Durham Tobacco, when they smelled the smoke from Green's factory. Orders for Green's tobacco began to accrue, reviving both his business and the tobacco industry.

Confederate banks, bonds, and money were now all worthless. However, Durham quickly found prosperity in the tobacco industry. Rapid growth of Durham in the post Civil War period was due to the surge in the tobacco manufacturing industry.

Brookes sent a letter to his father from his plantation in Jasper and Jones counties, Georgia. In the letter he discussed many problems he was facing on the plantation.  The troubles he wrote about included having to postpone planting, having to buy animals and having to deal with a fire in a field that burned a fence. He began the letter by discussing a delivery of materials by wagon that he had to send back to the city of Madison in the neighboring county.  The address did not clearly state that he was the intended recipient.  One reason the wagon's return was such a setback to Walker was that, among other things, this delivery contained two sacks of salt.  At the time salt was not only a condiment to improve the flavor of food, but a key nutritional component and a preservative. Without enough salt, Walter's health and food supply could have endangered.","In his book Salt: A World History, Mark Kurlansky recognized that salt had been an important substance throughout history.  People first and foremost had a biological need for salt.  Beyond this, though, salt was important because without easy refrigeration techniques, salt was necessary to store meat for later or to send it to sell in other places. This made salt trade and production an important element in the American economy from its earliest years. ","During the American Revolution there had been a series of salt shortages assuring that people in the years following would not forget salt's importance or the difficulty of obtaining it.  After the revolution there was increased salt production in the United States, this biggest production coming out of New York and Virginia.  Still, most of the salt in the United States was being imported.  ","Salt became especially important in the Civil War.  According to Kurlansky it was not only arms that the Southern army lacked but also salt.  For soldiers on the move salt was essential.  It allowed them to carry meat with them and served as a disinfectant during wars. ","We know that the Brookes family was wealthy, and so their financial ability to obtain salt was probably greater than most people in the South.  Since salt had to be imported either internationally or from a few places in the United States it was difficult to come by for everyone.  The shipping confusion experienced by Walker Brookes demonstrates the imperfections that existed in the system of distributing goods over the South.  Walker could not count on receiving what he needed when he expected it to come.  Having to send back a shipment of salt was not a matter of life or death for Walker Brookes, but it still provided plenty of reason to complain."],"display_date":"January 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-01-25","locations":[{"id":1945,"lat":33.3203883365,"lng":-83.69013905,"zoom":9,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2831,"title":"Texas Economics in 1880\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-06-08","end_date":"1880-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 8, 1880, Albert Roberts sat down at his desk at the office of P.J.

Either way, livestock was an important alternative to crops, which were difficult to depend on as they often had bad seasons.

They decided it was better to produce only what their family would need and then grow cotton to maximize their profits.","Although farms and tobacco and cotton plantations played a large role in the agricultural side of the South, many families and farmers also depended on livestock and game. In the antebellum South, hunting provided a way to supplement their limited agricultural sources of food. Also southerners hunted to reduce the overabundance of wildlife that fed on their crops and livestock. Not only was hunting a means of survival, but also the wealthy thought of hunting as a way to demonstrate their social status. After the Civil War, however, hunting decreased due to the urbanization of the South. Cities and towns were forming, and people were becoming more concentrated.

The land was not being used to its highest potential, which was a significant appeal to the Trust company.

The grand opening of the Greenville Tobacco Warehouse was the beginning of a new era in the prosperity of the town and community. The warehouse would allow the opportunity for farmers in Greenville to sell their tobacco close to home and by opening day, arrangements had already been made to bring in buyers from various other parts of North Carolina and other states.","The advent of the Greenville Tobacco Warehouse began to take form in June 1891 when a small group of men held a meeting in Greenville and made a unanimous decision to erect a local tobacco warehouse. They organized a stock company and the Greenville Land and Improvement Co. tendered a half an acre lot on Ninth Street upon which to build the warehouse. The company then purchased another adjoining lot of equal size to achieve the desired area with a floor space of 70x110 square feet. G.F. Evans conducted the warehouse during its first season with O.T. Forbes as the Floor Manager, L.L. Joyner as the bookkeeper and R.J. Hart as the auctioneer. G.F. Evans was the pioneer of tobacco culture in Pitt County and most farmers attributed its success largely to him. Everybody knew him as an upright, reliable man and believed that the general management of the warehouse could not have been placed in better hands.","The year 1890 had produced a good crop output and nearly every planter had increased his crop in 1891. In 1891, Pitt County planted approximately three thousand acres of tobacco. Tobacco warehouses had already been built in Rocky Mount, Wilson and Tarboro and Greenville's warehouse was characteristic of the greater spread of the tobacco culture along the Carolina coastal plains. While the heavy rains of July 1891 made for a bad crop season, the planters had invested too much time and capital to be discouraged.","As state farmers quickly realized the money to be made in tobacco, they began growing the bulk of their crops for market rather than producing their own food. Milton Ready suggested that the construction of the railroads, growth of towns and industries, multiplication of cotton gins and tobacco warehouses, where crops could be hauled in a day and sold for cash on the spot, made it practical to farm for profit.

More importantly, Charles Goethe Baylor came to the Convention to address the planters while on temporary leave from his position as the United States consul at Amsterdam.  The merchants of Amsterdam had authorized him to tender cash advances, at low interest, to merchants and planters who wished to trade with Amsterdam instead of Liverpool.  On October 14, 1851, a Georgia newspaper editor commented on the broader possibilities of a change in trade: England has of late years given a good deal of aid and comfort to abolitionism.  Her West India policy proves her antagonism to African slavery and her intervention in Cuba shows it still more, to say nothing of the money actually remitted by her anti-slavery societies, to promote abolition in this country.  Hence it becomes important for the south to foster the cotton manufacture of the continent of Europe, so as not to be dependent either on Old or New England. ","Baylor's speech was widely reprinted in newspapers in the weeks following the convention, and the planters were bursting to adopt his ideas.  The convention delegates immediately passed a resolution offered by Baylor favoring direct trade, and they further resolved that any adopted strategy must include direct trade.  The convention delegates, however, could not agree on what plan to adopt.  The one finally selected was widely criticized.  The national movement for direct trade began to grow and the planters became more involved in agricultural movements, but Baylor's activities did not succeed in bringing direct trade to the South.  "," Baylor did manage to empower the southern cotton planters, if only figuratively, by forcing them to consider the possibilities of their taking matters of international trade and economy into their own control.  They were a wealthy and potentially influential group of men who had the power to effect change for their own benefit, and to the advantage of the American free trade.  Baylor was likely one of the first prominent figures to publicly acknowledge that power and to ask the planters to use it.  He was perhaps more successful in doing so because of his valid and personalized appeal to the possibility of no longer being dependent upon England, which held both economic and cultural significance.  The country's abolitionist policies and England's historical control over the American economy were both significant points of tension, but the United States had yet to challenge or address either one.

Indeed, under a section labeled Alliance Principles and Demands, the first demand was unlimited silver coinage, or certificates based on silver.","Since the 1870s, the Alliance had, no doubt, had much concern over the silver issue.  The passage of The Coinage Act of 1873 and the Resumption Act of 1875 (full resumption of convertibility of paper money into gold, and vice versa, occurring in 1879), the United States returned to a commodity monetary standard as in pre-Civil War times, with the only difference being that silver was omitted and the standard was entirely a gold standard.  According to Milton Friedman, the most obvious, but by no means the most important, consequence of the U.S. return to gold rather than to a bimetallic standard was the sharp rise in the gold-silver price ratio.  A far more important consequence was the effect on the nominal prices of goods and services in general.  The increased world demand for gold...coincided with a slowing in the rate of increase of the world's stock of gold and a rising output of goods and services.  The result of these economic factors was deflation from 1875 to 1896, at a rate of roughly 1.7 percent a year in the United States...[with] the wholesale prices of agricultural and other basic commodities [falling] at a greater rate (3.0 percent a year by one index).  ","In the latter part of the 1800s, this deflation became a serious concern for farmers in the United States, including those in Mississippi, as it exacerbated the ongoing problems with sharecropping and foreign competition. Deflation affected the farmers of Mississippi, as farmers are affected both by the falling prices (the things they are selling are worth less at the market) and also the rise in the real value of their debt (most farmers are debtors, meaning simply that they must borrow money to prepare their farm before they can hopefully sell enough products at harvest time to make a profit and pay off their loans).  As the Mississippi Historical Society states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from 1870 to 1897, wheat prices fell from 1.06 a bushel to 63c a bushel, corn from 43c to 30c a bushel, and cotton from 15c a pound to 6c a pound. Most of the time farmers received even less for their produce.  The Historical Society blames over production, which may be true, but the overarching reason for this deflation was the monometallic standard.  Especially following 1890, deflation worsened and gave rise to the pro-silver politicians of the 1890s.  Because of the large farming constituency in Mississippi, these politicians were very popular in the State.  Such politicians supported returning to a bimetallic standard in order to ease the deflation and help American farmers (and sellers of silver), thus causing the State Alliance of Mississippi to publish in support of silver and agriculture in 1891.  ","The most influential silver politician of the 1890s was William Jennings Bryan, a Silver-Democrat (as opposed to a Gold Democrat) from Nebraska.  Bryan was especially popular in the strongly agricultural regions of the South, including Mississippi, and West.  Indeed, the Jackson Clarion Ledger repeatedly showered him with praise:  On July 9, 1896, the paper stated, in anticipation of the upcoming Democratic National Convention, that Mr. Bryan...is a finished orator with a resonant voice and command presence.  On October 15, 1896, the Clarion Ledger stated that Bryan is making the most wonderful canvass ever known in this country with his many speaking trips.  With these reports, the Ledger is reflecting his popularity with the farmers of Mississippi and the entire South.","In typical fashion, according to Friedman, William Jennings Bryan mesmerized the crowd at the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his now famous speech, in which he declared you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.  His speech has been called probably the most effective speech in the history of American party politics.  Bryan eventually won and accepted the Democratic nomination for President.  ","Although his platform had many other facets, which were outlined in his acceptance letter published in the Clarion Ledger on September 17, 1896, a bimetallic monetary standard and the free coinage of silver were always his main speaking points.  These points, however, began to lose ground during his campaign due to advances in gold extraction processes made by Scottish Chemists resulting in the beginnings of inflation.  Unfortunately for the Farmers' Alliance in Mississippi, Bryan's other platform stances were not strong enough for him to defeat William McKinley.  According to The World Almanac Encyclopedia of 1897, he ended up losing the election by 100 electoral votes and 603,514 popular votes.  As typical of the South and West, however, Bryan won 63,859 out of 71,184 votes in Mississippi, or slightly under 90 percent.  Election result maps show that McKinley was absolutely dominated in the region, excluding California, Oregon, and Washington.  Bryan's domination was due to the large farming and ranching constituencies in those areas, as well as, according to Richard Bensel, strong silver areas in such areas as Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah.  No doubt the Farmers' Alliance of Mississippi, as did many other similar organizations, rallied in his support."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - November 30, 1896","search_date":"1894-05-19","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2895,"title":"Human Property\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-01","end_date":"1833-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 1, 1833, when Charles Manigault moved slaves from another plantation he owned to Gowrie Plantation, several miles up stream from Savannah Georgia, he left neat columns of names to inventory his property, while at the same time, putting brackets around each slave family. Furthermore, next to each slave's name he wrote descriptions. Not physical descriptions but personality traits. Manigault deemed Jacob smart and intelligent and Plato he thought to be good and trusty; however, his praises stopped with Young John when he described him as lazy and Moses as slow and complaining. Manigault commented on his slaves' characters and personalities, not just their working abilities. He called Bob slow, honest, good. These traits have very little to do with work ethic and mostly with character."," It's not personal, it's business has become a mantra for much of the twentieth-century corporate world. Slave owners in the early nineteenth century, however, did not have the luxury of making that distinction because they were dealing with inherently personal things: humans. Charles Manigault displayed this fascinating balance between humanity and business in many of the records he kept of his plantation, as seen in these records. Slaveholders all had to navigate between the fact that their slaves were human and the fact that they were possessions. Many slaveholders did so by recognizing families and marriages within the plantation, by giving slaves measured freedom during their few days off, and by acknowledging such humanizing characteristics such as temperament and work ethic. Slaveholders did, however, repress this humanity in their slaves. They did so through whippings and constant verbal reminders to their slaves of their enslavement, and very few slaveholders to take familial ties into account when contemplating whether or not to sell a slave. "," This repression of enslaved people's humanity had two purposes. The first purpose was to keep slaves enslaved. By constantly suppressing their humanity and treating them as objects, many slaves learned to act as such, at least towards their masters. This deference and servility most likely made the day to day operations of the plantation far easier. The second purpose of the repression of humanity was for slaveholders' own consciences. Had slaveholders dwelled on the humanity of those people whom they were forcibly enslaving, slavery would not have continued. Instead slaveholders reduced their slaves to only partly human, seeing them as children they had to care for not humans they were enslaving. "," This paradox of understanding slaves' humanity as well as treating them as possessions applied to every slaveholder as well as to many non slaveholders who upheld this system of slavery and paternalism.

President R.T.C. Hunter oversaw the meeting as Mr. J.C. S. Brown discussed the necessary control of labor; he laid stress on the fact that no matter the situation, whether it was the tenant, the cropper, or the hiring system, the farmer was conned out of the most profit. As the President called for open discussion, Mr. E. P. Chalmers argued that if the farmers did not control their labor force in a more contractual manner, farming would be futile. According to this man, the farming community should have banded together in order to agree upon a labor committee; in response, Mr. H. H. Folk described a committee to find common beliefs between all members of the labor clubs across the county, and this concept was later adopted. Then, Mr. Chalmers described his essay on small grain; in his essay, he stressed the importance of independent sustenance farming. The modernization of the upper county yielded this change of food production as the farmers had become accustomed in shipping food stores; however, in the lower portion, the farmers continued to produce their own food, which attributes their success. However, Mr. Frank Moon contested this with the fact that the upper half's increased poverty level was a result of the greater impact of the freeing of the negroes. In response to all statements, Senator J.A. Sligh observed that the farmers were in a ruinous system that needed to be changed from the all cotton system. By raising all cotton, the farmers were forced to buy bread and meat; this economic system had to be restructured to incorporate food production in the economic system's post-war reconstruction."," While the farmers at the Newberry convention had personal arguments over labor in their county, this debate can be seen as a microcosm involving the labor issues across the state of South Carolina. As farmers across Newberry County attempted to stabilize the economy in the increased growth of cash crops, like cotton, which, modernization, according to Gerald Nash, played a major part in the economic metamorphosis after the war. As the slave system fell, industrial powers increased; however, labor was still required. Newberry County, and similar areas across the south, attempted a cotton-only market; however, they found that capital was not found in their constant import of food staples. Modernization decreased hard-labor requirements; however, their complete focus on cotton as a result of this lower labor level yielded economic instability that yielded labor debates across the area."],"display_date":"February 22, 1886 - February 23, 1886","search_date":"1886-02-22","locations":[{"id":11611,"lat":34.2951280342,"lng":-81.6113260746,"zoom":9,"place":"NEWBERRY, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2938,"title":"North Carolina Farmers&#39; Alliance Comes to Sampson County \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-01","end_date":"1888-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Although the Alliance appeared in Robeson County, North Carolina in the spring of 1887, it was not until January 1888 that the Farmers' Alliance reached Sampson. By October 1887, the Alliance had established a state organization, with Syndenham B. Alexander as its president, Leonidas L. Polk as secretary, and Elias Carr as chairman of the executive committee. The Alliance attracted both small and large landowning farmers, in addition to tenant farmers, rural doctors, and teachers. The group allowed women to join but excluded blacks, atheists, lawyers, and merchants from joining. Over the ten week period following the arrival of the Farmers' Alliance in Sampson, the organizers set up almost twenty sub-Alliances spreading from Newton Grove to Goshen. They advertised their organization by speaking at churches and schools and describing the Alliance to anyone who would listen. They would then set up a sub-Alliance in that area.","The Farmers' Alliance appealed to Sampson farmers and residents for a number of reasons, first of which was that it offered farmers goods and materials such as fertilizer, at lower prices. This allowed the farmers to avoid the high prices or credit problems that they associated with merchants. At this time, commercial agriculture was expanding in Sampson as production of cotton, the county's leading cash crop, had increased by more than 500% between 1860 and 1890. At the same time, cotton prices had fallen dramatically and the farmers could expect little help from the elected Democratic officials whose own interests favored the existing arrangements.","James Hunt argued that while the Alliance expanded to many places throughout North Carolina, the expansion of the Farmers' Alliance to Sampson County was especially important because it was in Sampson that the group found one of its most powerful leaders in Marion Butler. Shortly after learning about the Alliance, Butler became the president of the Sampson County division and published its news in his newspaper, The Caucasian. His presidency within the Alliance was the beginning of a long political road for Butler, leading to his election to the state Senate as an Alliance representative, president of the North Carolina Farmers' Alliance, president of the National Farmers' Alliance, and finally a six-year term to the United States Senate in 1894 as the Fusionist representative."],"display_date":"January 1, 1888 - January 30, 1888","search_date":"1888-01-15","locations":[{"id":9794,"lat":34.991531922,"lng":-78.3712329782,"zoom":9,"place":"SAMPSON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2953,"title":"Chinese Workers Arrive in Iberville Parish, Louisiana","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-10-26","end_date":"1870-10-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Chinese workers were wide-eyed with anticipation when they arrived at Edward Gay's St. Louis plantation in Iberville Parish, Louisiana on October 26, 1870.  The welcome that the workers recruited from California received when they stepped foot on the rich white Gay family's land was far from hospitable.  Moon-Ho Jung's <em>Coolies and Cane</em> frankly describes the scene: Gay's son Andrew, a planter himself, found the Chinese 'the queerest looking creatures he ever saw,' while his daughter 'laughed till she cried when they came stalking off the boat.'  These foreigners were received with a welcome of mocking disdain.  Gay's wife tried to fit the Chinese into her perception of the local racial structure.  She identified the Chinese as a mixture of mulatoe and Indian.  Edward Gay quickly tried to assimilate his new laborers into his plantation culture.  He gave them work clothes and sent them directly to work in the sugarcane fields.  The Chinese were only allowed to wear their Chinese dress on Sundays.  Just like slaves had been treated, these Chinese workers were stripped of their cultural dress the moment they arrived in Louisiana.  Although these were hired laborers, unlike African American slaves, they still faced similar repression in terms of expressing their specific culture traditions.","    Chinese laborers were gathered from California since agricultural labor was so scarce during Reconstruction in the plantation districts of Louisiana.  Many slaves had left the country or the South altogether, trying to shed its memories of bondage; others still just refused to do the same work they had been forced to do only a few years ago.  White workers often refused to take jobs formerly worked by slaves, as they felt such toil to be below them.  Therefore, with a large and continuously growing Chinese population in California, many plantation owners like Edward Gay looked to this other race to supply their need of labor.  As J.R. Tucker states in his article Race Progress in the United States, 75,132 of the 105,465 Chinese living in America in 1880 were located in California.  In addition, over 70,000 of the Chinese living in California were adult males who were prime candidates for the strenuous labor of the Louisiana cane fields.  ","Since labor prospects for post-Civil War Louisiana plantations were insufficient, owners looked to the growing Chinese population of California to assuage their problem.  Once the Chinese arrived in Louisiana, however, they faced prejudiced treatment that lingered from the recent times of slavery.  Racism was still deeply entrenched in many mindsets of the Louisiana Delta, and was reflected onto the unfamiliar Chinese the planters sought to exploit.  In order to rebuild their war-torn land and economy, plantation owners still used tactics and practices similar to those that had shown them such success during the system of slavery."],"display_date":"October 26, 1870","search_date":"1870-10-26","locations":[{"id":5535,"lat":30.2584984466,"lng":-91.3493659627,"zoom":9,"place":"IBERVILLE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2958,"title":"Plantation Owner Seeks Compensation From Incompetent Overseer\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-06-22","end_date":"1848-08-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 22, 1848, plantation owner John Powers filed a petition against his overseer, William Ingram, in the Inferior Court of Houston, Georgia. Powers sought reimbursement for financial losses resulting from the overseer's poor and irresponsible work, asserting that half of his cotton and corn crop was lost due to bad management, want of industry and misconduct of the defendant. His plantation lands were damaged as well, and he claimed that losses amounted to 1,750. Ingram allegedly neglected his duties to the point of contriving...to injure and aggrieve. On August 9, the Inferior Court dismissed the case and ordered Ingram to answer Powers' claims in the Superior court of Houston County on the fourth Monday of the following July.","Although affluent plantation owners usually owed their wealth to agricultural success, they often chose to outsource control of their plantations rather than become personally invested in the work, preferring to participate in the leisure activities of the Southern cultural aristocracy. As a result, overseers often had near-complete control over the farm, especially if the owner had more than one plantation and was often physically unavailable. As a result, a planter's continued success depended on the ability of the men he hired to take over the management position.","Although we do not know how accurate Powers' claims are, his was certainly not an unusual accusation. Plantation owners frequently believed that their overseers were incompetent, complaining about their work even when the consequences were not so financially devastating. William Scarborough argues that planters did not appreciate the difficulty of the position's many complicated and delicate tasks, and they expected too much of the overseers. The work was obviously complex if planters declined to do it themselves, but in their defense, overseers were sometimes not the most hardworking or determined employees. Presumably, the difficult and unrewarding nature of the work was not appealing to those who were truly qualified. It is not unreasonable to think that many overseers were unsuccessful, especially given that they had only a temporary interest in their work and would not necessarily benefit from any added success."],"display_date":"June 22, 1848 - August 9, 1848","search_date":"1848-07-16","locations":[{"id":1919,"lat":32.4768937786,"lng":-83.7324016007,"zoom":9,"place":"HOUSTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2963,"title":"Henry Banks&#39; Land Sale\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-05-08","end_date":"1816-05-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In May of 1816, Henry Banks put up his estate for sale.

Banks put an ad in a local Richmond paper, the Virginia Argus, to inform his neighbors of the sale.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

A company called the Bay Line and Pennsylvania railroad offered to take people in Norfolk to the Niagara Falls for 14 dollars in the Norfolk Virginian, thus expanding the number of places that Southerners could easily visit. This was a new mode of transportation that had revolutionized the pace and manner that southerners conducted their lives. Railroad rates although more expensive than steamboat fare was faster, more efficient, and did not rely on weather, water levels, or other uncontrollable circumstances to operate. In addition, railroads made hard to travel geographic areas much more accessible. For example, there was a fall line stretching from Virginia to Mississippi where the rivers were easy to navigate, but above that fall line the rivers were not navigable according to William Cooper, therefore railroads would enable travel above that fall line. Railroads not only transported people, but also goods. Goods such as cotton tobacco, lumber, cattle coal, and oil became more readily available to regions that did not produce these and also economically expanded these industries. Central Virginia had several major tobacco producing counties such as Prince Edward in the state that was one of the leading tobacco manufacturers, so the railway system was truly to its benefit. ","According to Cooper, the southern railroad tracks more than tripled from the 1880's to the 1890's. By 1890, there were more than 300 companies. However, there was a downside for railroad owners. Mostly rural and agricultural, the southern railroads had peak times of good transportation such as crop harvest periods, but all other times of the year saw little demand. Since railroads connected to so many places, it soon became an enormous industry and became one of the first big business industries of the South. The larger railroad companies soon became big influences in politics and railways leaders, like J.P. Morgan who constructed the Southern Railway became big names both in the industry and in politics.

The bullet from the double-barreled shot gun grazed Joseph Richburg's coat. Almost immediately, a second shot tore through his pants. Responding quickly, Richburg fired back at his adversary, Brewer, who had begun to flee. Then Richburg aimed his shot gun at Brewer's son, prepared to fire again. However, when Brewer's son dropped his gun and begged for mercy, Richburg allowed him to live. This confrontation in the form of a duel typifies the white Southern gentleman's way of dealing with a dispute. Moreover, Richburg's grace and mercy highlight a chivalrous, honorable deed that would have served to better his reputation. The culture of excessive masculinity in the South made duels a respected means of settling a conflict."," In the anonymously written <em>Practical Lessons Under the Code Duello</em>, published in 1874, there are valid instances when participation in duels is not only acceptable, but also necessary. The author goes on to state that if a man finds himself in some situation in which his authority or character is threatened, he must be...less than man if he were to submit in silence. The practice of dueling, the author believes, will never fade away, because it will be persisted in as long as a manly independence and a lofty personal pride in all that dignifies and ennobles the human character shall continue to exist. This bold statement clearly reveals the drive that pushed Richburg and Brewer to a duel. The code of honor that came with being a man was deeply branded within the mind of both Southerners."," Joseph Richburg and his neighbor Brewer had been friends in Madison Parish, Louisiana. They were both small planters and knew well the hardships of maintaining a self-sustaining farm. Both men would have relied on a barter system to attain goods and services. However, when Richburg owed Brewer some meat, <em>The National Police Gazette</em> cites that a dispute arose and that out of this tension grew a bad feeling which nothing but gore could satisfy. Richburg was unable to pay Brewer his debt, and so the men confronted one another in a duel. The two men met at Willow ditch, a lonely swamp between Pawpa Lake and Joe's bayou. Brewer brought his twenty-one year old son with him to the meeting, and Richburg brought his fifteen-year old son and his friend, Mr. Willis. Willis, acting as a mediator between the two men, persuaded the men to settle the matter with words and not bullets. Brewer's son, Willis, and Richburg converged to reach an agreement, but suddenly Brewer jumped out from behind a tree, shooting twice at Richburg. The scene described above then unfolded. "," The detailed description <em>The National Police Gazette</em> afforded this event is quite significant. It shows that duels were still a completely acceptable and sometimes necessary way to settle disputes between two men even in 1881. Southern men held themselves to a strict code of honor that included an aggressive, masculine showcase of confrontation which often culminated in dueling. Duels were afforded much attention in this culture of extreme virility that is so dramatically detailed in the both The National Police Gazette and the Code Duello."],"display_date":"May 21, 1881","search_date":"1881-05-21","locations":[{"id":5578,"lat":32.147356423,"lng":-91.0322487665,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3062,"title":"More than Just Dancing at the Ball\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-01","end_date":"1862-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Every year the Fearn plantation threw a ball in honor of the magnitude of work that had been done the year prior.

The Fearns were the last to leave for the ball. As they followed the path to get there, a large slave armed with knives approached Mr. Fearn. This slave had run away three months before to avoid the harsh demands of the sugar-grinding season. The plantation owner ordered the slave to put down his weapons. Out of respect for Mr. Fearns authority the slave fell to the owner's feet and begged to go to the ball. The master agreed to allow him to attend the ball, but warned he would be subject to the punishment by the other slaves. Upon entering the ball he was severely beaten by his fellow slaves and dragged from the ball.","Oftentimes runaway slaves were not punished directly by their owners. Many owners thought that runaways were just an inevitable part of slaveholding. Although slave escapes were a common occurrence, they did not cause much excitement. In fact an owner did not advertise that he had a runaway until that slave had been missing for several weeks. This composure about runaways was due to the fact that most slaves returned to the plantation because they could not bear to leave their families. It was assumed that a successful runaway would never return to the plantation he or she left and would leave his family forever. ","Family was one of the most treasured aspects of life for slaves. The Christmas season was the best time of the year for slaves because it enabled slaves to spend time with their families. Slaves were permitted to take a break from their grueling work to enjoy the holidays. On sugar plantations throughout Louisiana this leisure period was often pushed back until the end of January - after the grinding season. It was common that a dinner and a ball were held in honor of the slaves. Dancing was the most popular activity for the slaves. They danced long into the night. Fellow slaves played music and were sometimes able to make money doing so. Masters often gave their slaves gifts during the Christmas season and may have even given them passes to go where they pleased, within a certain distance, during the rest of their break.

The farmer wrote that there were two theories about the source of the epidemic that was rotting cotton crops across both South Carolina and Georgia: that the disease arose from degradation of the cotton plants due to over cultivation, or that a scourge of insects was responsible for the ruin. Supporters of the first theory contended that bad cultivation of foreign plants is known to lead to an eventual decline in the vegetable quality, and also cited the fact that the disease spread very uniformly and very quickly across the cotton growing region, suggesting that the cause must be a disease because insects need time to migrate. Proponents of the insect based theory offered support for their theory by referring to several sightings of strange insects in cotton fields and puncture wounds found in the cotton boles of spoiled crops."," The author of the article discussed both these theories as possible sources of the cotton rot affecting the South. However he himself did not claim to hold the answer to the problem, and therefore suggested that the state should provide funding for agriculture societies to further research the matter. He expressed his opinion that this crisis should be a priority for South Carolina because of the economic implications of wide spread cotton rot: if a solution cannot be found it was unclear what crop would provide an acceptable substitute for cotton as a cash crop. The regional land was not suitable for growing tobacco, indigo, or wheat. He also expressed concern that a particular species of property [slaves] will soon be of little value if a solution is not quickly discovered.","The South depended upon the economic success of cotton.

One not only had to be intelligent, but also wealthy. James N. Greear of Scott County, Virginia was one such man. In a letter home, Greear informed his father of his great interest in medicine and of the recent examinations he had taken. He noted that he had taken the examinations necessary to graduate though he was not sure of his intentions to apply for graduation. A majority of his letter revolves around his financial situation. Knowing it would be of keen interest to his father, he writes that he has spent ?not a lot? of money and then cites each of his expenses and its monetary value. Greear goes on to inquire about his father?s farming situation in Scott County. He asks where his father had been selling his corn crop and how much more clearing of the crop he had left. Noting it was April, he wondered if an early spring would reap more fruit. His inquiry into his father?s corn success is in fact Greear?s only interest in his home town affairs. ","Many southerners were forced to make an entire living off of a single crop. James Greear?s great interest in his father?s corn crop is due to the fact that his tuition money was most likely the direct result of that crop. Corn had been grown in Appalachia for many years before white settlers arrived there. Cherokee Indians, who inhabited the land during the frontier period, heavily influenced the whites that later settled there. Wheat was at first very difficult to grow in Virginia due to high counts of nitrogen in the soil and the difficulty in uprooting tree stumps. Adopting the techniques of the native Cherokee, corn became the most commonly grown crop in Appalachia. Corn took very little effort to grow and thus early on in the settlement of the colonies, most farmers grew it. While by 1882 southern agriculture had become far more diversified, the demand for corn was still present. It is no surprise that James Greear?s letter is mainly focused on his expenses at school and the success of his father?s corn crop. One poor harvest could devastate a farmer financially.

In addition, Trammell gave the slaves a plot of land and allowed them to work the land on Saturday afternoons."," This kind treatment was not universal. Many owners worked their slaves to the extreme. Some owners forced their slaves to work Saturdays and few gave rest days for Sunday. They also utilized the slaves in every capacity.

Unfortunately, keeping these animals healthy after the Civil War became a constant struggle for many Appalachian farmers. Disease ravaged the livestock population after the war. In 1884, the Wytheville Dispatch ran an article about ?our friend? Bob Crockett. Crockett was famous in Wytheville for his work in improving the cattle, sheep, and horse population. Disaster had struck, however, when he lost several of his valuable, full-bred Catawold Ewes to poisoning. The newspaper noted that Crockett had a clue as to who was responsible, and it gave its best wishes to him in bringing those who committed the ?cowardly act? to justice.","Cattle, sheep, and horses were invaluable to Appalachian farmers following the Civil War. Responsible for improving the livestock population, Bob Crockett was a local hero. Before the war, cattle fever, or glanders, was nearly non-existent in Virginia. As the livestock in North Carolina, Georgia and other southern states became sick prior to the war, Virginians made sure their cattle had no contact with them. When the war began and livestock grew scarce, Confederate soldiers demanded cattle be brought to them in Virginia. Thus, after forty years of no disease, cattle fever became rampant in Virginia by 1865. Other southerners blamed the disease on northern soldiers who purposely left their diseased horses on southern land, spreading the glanders disease. Soon southern farmers were faced not only with cattle fever but also an equine influenza that would do even more damage. ","The Civil War destroyed the southern landscape. Railroad tracks were torn up, farm land became infertile, and disease was everywhere. The livestock epidemic that ravaged Virginia only made things more impossible. High cattle losses meant farmers had very little homemade fertilizer. Low supplies of fertilizer made farming and recovery nearly impossible. Bob Crockett was a savior to farmers in Virginia for rehabilitating some of the livestock.

Commissioned by the Missionary Society of Connecticut in 1815 to preach Christianity to the masses of emigrants moving west, Flint was no stranger to such exploration. He ministered in the Ohio Valley, St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as taking an opportunity to travel through the new Arkansas Territory in 1819. Due to ill health, he was often traveling between Louisiana and New England, seeking escape from the sweltering heat of summer and the freezing cold of winter. "," After traveling several days east along the Red River in 1835, he finally came to its junction with the Ouachita River, which could take him north through the Arkansas Territory, should he choose. Flint found, even at this remote place, small cabins dotting the landscape where just a few years before there had been no one. He employed the services of one such settler, a Hollander dressed in a shabby and crude Robinson Crusoe costume, to ferry him closer to the Ouachita. Flint was so amused by his new friend that he requested to see where this Dutchman lived. The Dutchman obliged, presenting Flint with a small two room cabin surrounded by cultivated peach and plum trees and a small garden, miles from any other habitation. His home was dug into the side of an Indian mound, which he shared with his animals. Like his clothing, all his tools, eating utensils, and dishes were crude and hand-made. The ferryman took the opportunity to express his opinion on religion as well, pushing a book of Astrology on the Reverend. Flint graciously declined, lamenting a lack of familiarity with the Dutch language. "," Whatever entertainment Timothy Flint gained from such a man, he still expressed regret that so great a proportion of the emigrants are of the class of poor, vagrant, and worthless foreigners, the scum of despotic governments. Many who emigrated to the frontier owned very few slaves or none at all and appear in the tax records as not owning property, much like the Dutch ferryman. These men and their families eked out a small living, and required, as many church officials from the East believed, a revived understanding of the Christian faith due to their removal from civilized society. ","In the same year that the Missionary Society of Connecticut sent Reverend Flint west, a New York paper, <em>The Patrol</em>, reprinted a progress report from the Louisiana Bible Society, expressing concern that the want of Bibles in Louisiana has been extreme.

The Rambins' cotton crop had failed that year because of excessive drought, worrying Rambin about her family's future, and the future of the poor around the area. Rambin expresses to her sister concern about what her own family would do with a working plantation, and even greater concern for the poor who do not even have any land to depend on with the failing crops.","Rambin's letter to her sister expresses many of the fears of Louisiana planters during this period. A failure of the cotton crop was a constant concern; especially since cotton prices had been continuing to decrease due to a worldwide overproduction of cotton. The difficultly of creating a profit from the cotton crop landed many of the sharecroppers, like the family Mr. Rambin had brought, in debt. Despite the financial hardship these sharecroppers faced, the African Americans were able to gain greater autonomy in this system because it allowed them to choose their own employers. The majority of African Americans remained poor and often in debt, but the ability to regulate their own land and time gave them the independence that they craved after emancipation. ","Plantation owners who leased parts of their land out, and then held the tenants responsible for one-half of the crop did not have much more financial success than their sharecroppers.

In his private diary, Ruffin noted that these men belonged to a peculiar class: In about a space of 10 miles square of Williamsburg and Georgetown districts, the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, have no slaves, scarcely any other property, and almost no agricultural labor or regular industry of any kind. The men live by hunting, often helped out by petty pillage or trespass on the neighboring properties. These people, and even the more industrious and honest of the poor in lower S.

But as Stephanie McCurry demonstrates in <em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>, the intricate relationships of power within the yeoman household were just as significant as those more conspicuous class tensions between plantation owners and yeoman farmers. Poor white men set boundaries of power within their household that defined the roles of their wives and their laborers. The yeomen and the powerful planters of the low country were not socioeconomic equals, but they shared a position of power over their respective households, a power rooted in gendered symbols of inequality, command over dependents, and a fundamental assertion of manly independence."],"display_date":"March 31, 1843","search_date":"1843-03-31","locations":[{"id":11523,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3305,"title":"Bread in the South During the 1860s and 1870s\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-31","end_date":"1863-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Levi Pitman was a respectable southern gentleman living in the southern county of Shenandoah in Virginia during the Civil War.

In 1863 the Rebel soldiers were camped near Levi's home and he could go and watch them march for their leader. He and his wife met some of the soldiers and his wife began to bake for them. Mrs. Pitman would cook and bring the soldiers bread provided that they brought her the flour to make it with.","It is not certain from Levi's diaries what kind of bread Mrs. Pitman would bake but it can be guessed at based on the trends of that time. Until well after the Civil War grain was very hard and expensive to process and only the wealthiest of plantation owners dared to eat it on a regular basis. Corn Bread was the main bread of the South, because of its flexibility and ease of processing. Lots of southerners would eat hoe bread which was corn bread baked over a fire on top of a farmers hoe. Because corn bread did not keep very well the southern tradition of warm bread at meals began to develop. Southern farms and plantations were often ransacked by Union troops traveling through the land; they would often take food and supplies for themselves. It is not surprising given the poverty of the time and the threat of Union soldiers that Mrs. Pitman would want to save her food stores for her family. Southern women were often willing to help confederate soldiers, though, if provided the supplies to do so. In later years grain production spread throughout the west and processing became cheaper prices of grain also fell, allowing poorer farmers to enjoy wheat bread like the elite. The bread Mrs. Pitman was probably baking for the soldier was corn bread. The short keep time of the bread explains why the soldiers continued to come back and ask her to bake more."],"display_date":"July 31, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-31","locations":[{"id":14269,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3314,"title":"Overseer&#39;s Place on a Southern Plantation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1864 Thomas D.

Thomas was given a list of assignments that he was to regularly do and another list of things he could do if he was finished with his own. The contract set that Thomas was set to receive a portion of the crop yields along with pork and corn. The contract even had a provision in it to break the contract based on the vote of three men, one chosen by the overseer, one by Beverly and one by the two men combined. ","Although slave overseers were not common in small plantations, they were almost necessary for plantations with 50 or more slaves Cooper and Terrill assert. An overseer's job was to ensure that the slaves were doing as much work as they should be and that everything was being done to improve the crop yield. Overseers were generally hired seasonally and a planter would generally try and find a new one for the next season. For this reason overseers worked especially hard to prove themselves to their employer. They needed to show that they possessed the right qualities to push the slaves just enough to produce more without overworking him. Overseers were mostly young men who were looking for experience to some day own their own land. Pay for the overseers ranged from 700 to 2,000 a year for cane and rice plantations, from 200 to 1,000 on cotton and tobacco plantations. Overseers were also usually given a place to live and given a small garden of their own. It might seem strange at first glance that Beverly would think about hiring an overseer just before the end of the Civil War, but it must be kept in mind that slaveholders and the majority of the South were still hoping that the Confederacy would pull through and save slavery."],"display_date":1864,"search_date":"1864-07-01","locations":[{"id":13926,"lat":36.6827683486,"lng":-79.8736743254,"zoom":10,"place":"HENRY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3335,"title":"The Joint-Worm Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-07-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["To the residents of Fauquier County, and those living in many parts of Virginia, agriculture was a way of life. And if that livelihood was threatened, the residents knew that they would have to work together to protect it. As the <em>New York Times</em> reported on July 21, 1854, farmers held a convention in Warrenton, Va, entitled The Joint-Worm Convention, in an effort to stop the destruction of the wheat crop in the region by the joint-worm pest. As the article stated, the organizers felt that the wheat crop was of the greatest importance to the state."," When all was said and done, the Convention proved to be a success as the following several recommendations were decided on and put forth unanimously by the community. The members of the convention decided that wheat should be planted early and in the most thrifty and hardy varieties. Additionally, no activities that would retard the growth of the crop, such as grazing, would be tolerated. Farmers were encouraged to work with their neighbors and conspire to sow adjoining fields in wheat the same year. And finally, all the straw that had not been fed before the 1st of May [was] to be burned to protect from infestation by the dreaded pests."," The <em>Times</em> pointed to the Convention in Warrenton as an example for all those who sought to reach resolutions in the form of committee. The Joint-Worm meeting set itself apart from the thousands of Conventions at the time by its apart effectiveness. Along with deciding on the various resolutions, those present at the Convention also appointed committees to oversee the farmers in particular districts. Despite their efficiency in compromising, all present at the meeting were not so bold as to suggest that any of their plans could succeed without the help of the Will of Him who gives and withholds crops."," Agriculture was of the utmost importance to the farmers of Northern Virginia and Fauquier County. Additionally, as mentioned by historians Kenneth E. Koons and Kenneth W. Keller, wheat was the primary crop the residents of the region depended on for economic success throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. The importance of wheat, as well as its susceptibility to vermin, including rust, joint-worm and the Hessian fly, made it necessary for farmers to cooperate to protect their livelihood. If one farmer's product became infested with a pest, his neighbor also became vulnerable. And if the agricultural output of counties in Northern Virginia, such as Fauquier, was threatened than the region's whole economy, and subsequently the way of life of its citizens, was threatened."],"display_date":"July - December 1854","search_date":"1854-09-30","locations":[{"id":13805,"lat":38.7385889089,"lng":-77.8094319404,"zoom":9,"place":"FAUQUIER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3361,"title":"The Effects of Fertile Land in the Mississippi Delta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-01-01","end_date":"1820-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a letter received by James Ure, John Bisland, a long time friend was intent on convincing him to move to Mississippi and invest in the cotton industry because of how easy it [was] to make money here. I bought 100 acres of land which lay contiguous to my estate [and] paid 600 dollars he explained and was able to make about 500 dollars by only planting cotton on seventeen acres. Cotton was seen as an agricultural gold mine and resulted in a great hunt to search for and obtain this valuable land. ","This widespread desire for cotton created an economical boom in Mississippi which led to an increased number of settlers. After the War of 1812, a substantial number of Native Americans were removed from the area which offered fresh land at a cheep price to anyone who was interested in farming agricultural products. The geographical location of this state consequently turned Mississippi into one of the leading cotton producing areas in the nation due to the fertile soils and excellent climate needed for farming this crop. Because the soil was so deep and rich, farmers could plant cotton season after season without having to rotate fields or worry about exhausting the supply of nutrients in the dirt. This newly liberated land not only became the home for rich plantation owners who cultivated cotton on large plots of land. Poorer farmers were able to purchase property and raise row crops and tend to livestock as well as middle class folk who had dreams of someday entering the plantation society by working their way up to larger plots of land as they became more successful. ","Raising and picking cotton demand a great deal of hand labor, and the crop, typically, was worked by slave gang labor on large plantations. This overbearing stipulation resulted in a search by plantation owners to find more help on farms. Slaves were heavily sought after and cotton became one of the most influential contributors to the slave trade because of the number of people it took to harvest. By 1820 in cotton producing areas of Tennessee the number of African Americans populating this region had increased exponentially consisting of 80,107 blacks which formed 18.9 percent of the total residents. Slaves were so sought after in Mississippi that Natchez became the busiest slave market in the south after Algiers, in New Orleans.

The Mississippi River, so vital to the economic profit of the sugar and cotton plantations along its banks, flooded and overflowed the fields of both parishes. Whole crops were ruined. According to B. Levy & Company's Price Current, published in the <em>Baltimore Patriot</em> on July 2, twenty to thirty thousand bales of cotton were lost. ","While sugar production was limited to the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas in Louisiana along the Mississippi River, cotton production occurred across the Deep South. Production of the crop tripled within five years. By 1820, almost 159,500 bales of cotton were harvested across the southern United States. The demand for cotton, especially for the English textile mills, made average American cotton farmers dominant members of the global market. ","But while U.S. farmers would lead the world cotton market until the Civil War, the mid-1820s brought falling prices due to overproduction. Cotton planters found themselves unable to receive more than ten cents per pound of cotton. More and more farmers found themselves in debt and unable to pay off the government for public lands they had bought to farm. Cotton production continued to increase throughout the 1820s, which only served to exacerbate the problem rather than solve it. The flooding on the Mississippi in the summer of 1823 no doubt only added insult to injury, wiping out an entire season's crop. And while B. Levy & Company were unconcerned since farmers all over the South produced more than enough cotton for one flood to effect the price or availability until a year in the future, the farmers of the Mississippi and its tributaries found themselves in dire straits. ","While the newspaper report covered only the economic impact of product loss, it made no mention of the loss of human lives, property, or homes. Whole farms were completely underwater. The rather impersonal business article failed to express the emotional and physical devastation flooding could cause. In many cases, if a family lost their fields in the flood, they also lost their home, personal belongings, livestock, and perhaps even members of their family or friends and neighbors. Depending on how fast the rivers flooded, many people might have been unable to escape. This included the many numbers of slaves kept to work the cotton and sugar plantations. While slave-owners might not equate the death of slaves with human deaths, the loss of slaves would be considered the loss of a considerable investment.

However, she was scheduled to leave for Europe to meet with her husband, and the plantation would have to continue its day-to-day activities without her supervision. Leigh wrote in her diary that she worried about leaving the place entirely in charge of the negro captains, even though her slaves were recognized within her community as well behaved. However, to her surprise, the workers approached her and begged that [she] would leave some one over them in [her] place when [she] left. They pleaded, Missus, we must have a white men to back us when you are gone; de people not mind what we say. To her great relief, Leigh was able to employ a white overseer to manage the black laborers in her absence. He was a man recommended to her by trusted neighbors. Later in her diary she wrote that neighbors spoke of how well kept her plantation was and how orderly the black workers were compared to others. ","Not only was Leigh nervous about leaving the plantation without a white overseer, but the black workers themselves were as well. They insisted on having a white manager to increase the legitimacy of their place above the other black laborers. Perhaps having a white overseer acknowledge the black captains' positions within the hierarchy on the plantation increased the respect they were shown by their fellow hired-hands. Later in her diary, Leigh wrote that there existed two vital characteristics that a successful overseer must possess: he must be southern, and a gentleman. She surmised that only Southerners were capable of understanding blacks and their peculiarities. Northerners, no matter how hard they tried, would never be able to understand their characters. Northerners had not lived their entire lives alongside the blacks; they had not experienced the trials and tribulations of every day life that influence people's development. Southerners had grown up with blacks who they considered a part of the family. Additionally, class was extremely important. Leigh observed that it was useless to put a person holding an inferior social position over them, because the laborers were highly conscientious of class dynamics. Having been at the bottom of the social hierarchy for so long, African Americans recognized that emancipation had opened up the opportunity for social advancement. Through hard work they could gradually move up in society. In the fields, though, they were less likely to work hard if their overseer was not of a higher class. They did not consider him worthy of their deference or respect. It was not enough that the overseer be white; he must be of a distinguished character. The dynamics of the relationship between the hired black laborers and their white employer represent a post-war South that seemed to replicate antebellum social practices. And yet, the importance of class hints at a growing indication that blacks were aware of their status as freedmen. They understood that their place in the social hierarchy was no longer permanently stagnant.

He worked in the mill along with the family's two male slaves, and possibly with occasional help from his five sons. Bishop's mill supported his main economic activity, which was tanning leather. But Bishop sometimes allowed the use of his facilities to grind nearby farmers' grain, typically for free. Over the years Bishop twice had to rebuild his mill. It is possible that it was damage by one of the floods that periodically struck eastern Virginia rivers. It is also possible that the mill's wooden moving parts wore out, perhaps exhausted by the extra task of pro bono grain grinding. It is likely that on at least one of the rebuilding occasions, Bishop upgraded the technology of his mill. In 1820, after repairing his mill for the second time, Bishop ran out of generosity toward the neighbors for whom he used to grind wheat for free. He publicly announced that he would no longer grind on any terms whatsoever, and that anybody who needed grinding done should build a simple mill of their own. He may have stood by this threat for some time, but by the late 1820s he joined eleven other Albemarle gristmills in commercial production, and began selling ground corn meal in bulk. "," Historian Melvin Ely described the operation of mills and their place in the daily life of nearby Appomattox, a piedmont Virginia county similar to Albemarle in many respects. Many mills only ground wheat, though many combined that task with sawing, ginning cotton, producing textiles, or making soap. After harvest, small farmers would sell their surplus grain to the local mill. The miller would grind the grain and store it in bulk. Store-owners in towns could then buy grain to retail, or individual families could buy it as needed directly from the miller. At this time a typical barrel sold for somewhere between 4.00 and 12.00, depending on quality of the grain. According to Ely, The typical mill in the area was manned by a miller, a cooper, and perhaps a few helpers. Slaves were often employed in mills, and often became as proficient at the tasks of operation as the miller himself. Free blacks, too, often found employment in mills. "," At the beginning of the nineteenth century one of the most popular books in the United States was comprehensive guide to the science and practice of milling, written by a Delaware entrepreneur named Oliver Evans. The book's success was bolstered by the fact that Evans included descriptions of labor-saving mechanical processes he had recently invented. More important, though, was Evans's ability to relate technical information to a wide audience, in common, unpretentious language. Evans's Miller's Guide was the first of its kind, popular throughout America. Previously, technical advancement often only spread through word of mouth, rough sketches, and ideas in individuals' heads."],"display_date":"March 11, 1820","search_date":"1820-03-11","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3399,"title":"Opposition to Special Field Order No. 15\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-01","end_date":"1865-02-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John C. Robinson never owned any slaves. He was born in Binghamton, New York and served as a Union general during the Civil War. Despite his Northern background, Robinson objected to the passage of Special Field Order No. 15, which granted massive amounts of land to former slaves in January of 1865. On February 1, 1865 Robinson sent a letter to President Abraham Lincoln in which he argued against granting slaves the land and freedoms promised to them by the victorious Union General William Tecumseh Sherman in Special Field Order No.15. Robinson reasoned that the slaves did not have the necessary skills to function independently. As quoted from his letter, In cases where the negros planted their own land with cotton they were often too lazy to pick it when ripe, and refused to allow others to do so on the most liberal terms and the cotton rotted in the field. He viewed the land to be too agriculturally valuable to let go to waste. In <em>Rehearsal for Reconstruction</em>, Willie Lee Rose discusses a possible reason for this lack of work ethic amongst the former slaves. While enslaved, blacks received no cash reward for growing cotton. Upon being freed, they naturally focused their agricultural efforts on cultivating and sustaining crops such as corn and potatoes; harvests they knew would help them survive. Cotton served no purpose - agriculturally or economically - to the formerly enslaved. As quoted from Rehearsal for Reconstruction, The advantages of the year-long tyranny of Sea-Island cotton had not been readily apparent to the simple people who had never received a cash reward for growing it. "," Special Field Order No. 15, enacted on January 16, 1865, reserved, as quoted directly, The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. John?s River, Florida for the settlement of negroes. The order was passed by Sherman and made use of land the Union army had seized near the end of the Civil War following his destructive March to the Sea. The majority of the land included in the order had previously belonged to white plantation owners yet it was nevertheless set-aside for former slaves. Special Field Order No. 15 is commonly referred to as the 40 acres and a mule act. Robinson's final point in his letter to Lincoln was that when Congress eventually decided to sell the land, the inhabitants would be left homeless. He was not against giving African Americans land; rather, he believed that such a vast amount of land should be properly managed instead of wasted by those who had neither the skill nor the intention of using it."],"display_date":"February 1, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-01","locations":[{"id":1510,"lat":31.6956666643,"lng":-82.2948071414,"zoom":9,"place":"APPLING, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3406,"title":"White Power and Black Wage Labor \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-01","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Francis Leigh Butler ran her plantation on her own.

Hawks was the Assistant Surgeon in charge of Hospital No. 10, a hospital founded in April of 1863 to serve African American Union soldiers. Since the hospitals inception, Hawks had received various donations of food ? ? cart load of watermelons, sweet potatoes, syrups, eggs, and chickens ? for his patients at the hospital. As quoted in his letter to the editor, ?The people of color have contributed very liberally to supply the wants of the sick and wounded soldiers, and will not soon be forgotten.? "," Beaufort was captured by Union forces on December 11, 1861 and was occupied by the Union army for the rest of the war. The majority of the white citizens fled the town for Charleston and left their slaves behind on November 7, 1861 when Union naval forces captured Port Royal. Left unattended in the absence of their masters, slaves looted plantations and food storages. To the slaves, November 7, 1861 was the ?Day of the Big Gun Shoot.? Sam Mitchell, a slave on a Beaufort plantation, thought the Union bombardment on Fort Walker was the sound of thunder rolling. His mother corrected him. ??Son, dat ain?t no t?under, dat Yankee come to gib you Freedom.?

And, fortunately for William hunter, the ship that was lost to the sand bar (he could not remember the name of the ship) was not carrying his goods. However, the incident was instructive to Hunter, as he reported to his business associate James Perry (who resided in Missouri at the time), in that after the ship's destruction he began to insure their goods against loss. Though he had not calculated on paying for insurance, he was advised by Mills and McKinstry by all means to insure all [of his goods]. Though Perry judged insurance to be a good idea in light of the uncertain marine transportation, the cost was such that he had to defer his payment to the proprietor of the schooner shipping his goods until he could sell goods to pay him [with the profits].","With the exception of the first and last sentences of his letter, Hunter's correspondence dealt exclusively with business interests and the protection thereof. Hunter proceeded to relate his most recent dealings, payments, and debts to Perry, as well the difficult time he had getting his goods through the customhouse. Such a focus on economic concerns is not surprising in a letter to a business partner, but the detailed analyses of the young Texan market serve as a reminder that the early settlement of Texas was mostly by people seeking economic opportunity. Though the history of the United States demonstrates examples of both economically and ideologically motivated migrations, the colonization of Texas with which Hunter and Perry were associated clearly aligns with the latter. One of the primary motivations for the settlement of Mexico was the availability and cheap cost of land. While land in the United States cost 1.25 per acre, land was available in Texas for about four cents per acre. Additionally, each head of a family could claim 4, 605 acres. Through the efforts of businessmen like Perry, Hunter, and Stephen Austin, settlements sprang up rapidly and Texas became a link between the stagnating economy of Mexico and the booming market of the United States. ","From 1800 to the decades after Anglo-American colonization began, Mexico's economy underwent a slight decline. America, however, saw a massive increase in economic power. The only significant economic growth that occurred in Mexico during the time period was in Mexico's far north (i.e., Texas and New Mexico), and, according to Resendez, this growth was fueled predominantly by foreign immigration, the opening of new trading routes to the United States, the availability of cheap import goods, and the region... as a crossroads of exchange. The relative prosperity of the northern parts of Mexico due to their ties to the U.S. economy is indicative of the overall growth in the American market. Resendez states that at the same time the Mexican economy was undergoing a slight decline (of about ten percent), the United States economy grew 1270.4 percent between 1800 and 1860. This growth was due in part to the increased agricultural production of the South, which spurred entrepreneurs to try their hand at developing the new lands of Texas.

As he is mentioned in a letter to James Perry, who had a number of business interests in Texas, it is probable that he was there in a role of some relation to James Perry's investments. Unfortunately for Perry, the winter of 1831 was the worst winter that Texas had experienced for several years. Upon disembarking from his boat, he intended to venture further on into the settlements, but was detained for four days by bad weather and high water. Perry was, of course, not the only one to suffer from the adverse weather conditions and their effects on the local road systems. ","William Hunter, James Perry's agent who had been running his business in Texas commented upon the economically pernicious results of the impassable roadways. Hunter related to James Perry that he had only been able to transport two loads of their goods up from the river where they were deposited by boat. He declared that he was verry much disappointed in getting hauling done because a team that had started to the river for a load the previous week had returned empty-handed. He further noted that one or two teams were mired down on the roadways at the time. This development was clearly economically damaging, as Hunter could not sell goods that he didn't have in his possession. He lamented that if his goods had arrived before the bad weather, he could have done a good business. Like the financial fortunes of Perry and Hunter, the economic well being of the South was highly dependent on roads and other means of transportation. Well-kept roads were crucial for the shipment of goods, especially from rural areas to urban centers where they could be sold or shipped to larger markets. As a result, local governments communities throughout the South put much emphasis on road maintenance even at a time where municipal services were few. An excellent example of this facet of community cooperation occurred in Virginia's Prince Edward County. As noted in Israel on the Appomatox, the Prince Edward county court expended considerable effort responding to petitions for new roadways. Also, county surveyors, or citizens in charge of certain sections of road were enlisted for general maintenance of thoroughfares. These surveyors had the power to conscript other men's slaves (and free blacks) for several days each year in the interest of improving roads. The yearly cleanup allowed for uninhibited commerce along the county's highways and byways. Because the economy of the South produced primarily agricultural goods that had to be shipped for sale, good systems of transportation were crucial. In addition to roads, transportation throughout the South was carried out by other means such as boats or, later on, railroads. However, at the time of Perry's detainment by muddy paths, Texas was little more than a collection of settlements strung together by roads that were clearly inadequate for year-round business."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3499,"title":"Southern Appalachia&#39;s Livestock Economy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-12-12","end_date":"1826-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Shepherdstown County, the blood was flowing. Such is what James Markell's sister wrote to her absent brother in the winter of 1826 concerning the hog butchering frenzy in that western Virginia area. For the past two weeks, several couples had also celebrated their nuptials never minding the penetrating squeals of the dying pigs around them. New families would begin and there would be plenty of food for Shepherdstown. Energy and happiness filled the Markell household. "," With southern livestock like hogs accounting for over two times the value of the cotton crop by 1860, the Markells had good reason to feel elated. They were part of the army of farmers in the South that would grow to produce two-thirds of America's hogs for the one hundred million dollar US market in that same period. Three types of people led this hog-raising cohort: planters, yeoman farmers, and drovers. Planters generally felt that keeping hogs was beneath them and consequently raised the fewest hogs of the group. In southern Appalachia, wealthy planters often contracted with landless farmers to sharecrop hogs and cattle on some of their more mountainous land. These landlords would supply necessary farm equipment to these poor farmers and then take a majority portion of the livestock yield at the appropriate time. Making up about three times more of the labor force than these landless folk, wage workers played an even more important role in the southern Appalachian livestock economy as short-term laborers or long-term contract employees. Yeoman farmers stood in between the planters with their workers and the drovers in producing sizable herds of hogs. Drovers earned their moniker because they almost exclusively herded animals and drove them to market as opposed to cultivating crops. In the process of taking thousands upon thousands of animals to market, drovers would support local economies by purchasing feed and other supplies for the hogs."," In contrast to some commonly held beliefs, planters did not unequivocally dominate this agrarian social group. Not all rural people aspired to the life of the planter because they had found handsome profits in more mobile lives as herders. Becoming planters was also exceedingly difficult for most southern Appalachians, so they remained in their sharecropping and herding roles across generations. Southern society recognized the important role that these people played and protected their grazing ranges for many years by limiting fencing law protection for the planter class's crops. It is hard to say where the Markells stood on this issue, but there is no doubt they were happy that their hogs were fat."],"display_date":"December 12, 1826","search_date":"1826-12-12","locations":[{"id":14642,"lat":39.30762356,"lng":-77.8627617422,"zoom":10,"place":"JEFFERSON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3519,"title":"Welcome to West Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-01","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Seven years after its creation, West Virginia continued to be less populated than its older, more widely settled eastern counterpart. According to the Encyclopedia of the South, at the end of the Civil War West Virginia was an undeveloped and rural state with a population of only about 400,000, or about one-third that of contemporary Virginia. In part to attempt to counteract this imbalance, as well as take advantage of the ongoing influx of immigrants into the United States who were moving west, J.H. Diss Debar, the State Commissioner of Immigration for West Virginia, wrote a short book. The book promoted the benefits of moving west and its author hoped to secure for it the attention and confidence of that class of honest and enterprising workers in both hemispheres, whom we are most anxious to welcome as permanent settlers to our infant state. He then proceeded to write a most complimentary compendium of West Virginia and its many assets. Debar's description of West Virginia's assets attempted to take advantage of America's rapidly expanding population, as well as its growing economic prosperity.","West Virginia was, and still is, one of the most rural states in America. Its decision to separate itself from Virginia was related, in part, to the remote and hostile nature of its geography. Slavery, though present in western Virginia, was never as prevalent as it was in the eastern half of the state. The Appalachian Mountains that cover most of the state prevented the establishment of large plantations. The lack of a viable cash crop also reduced the necessity of slavery in the area. Plus, the settlers that had moved to West Virginia prior to the Civil War tended not to be the most industrious of men. As Debar so generously put it, The genuine West Virginian is not much addicted to precipitous motion, rarely loses his temper or self-possession, and beyond the acquisition of the necessities of life, limited by almost Spartan frugality, is disposed to leave the improvement of things around him to time and chance. ","The migration of settlers to the South came to a halt during the Civil War, but picked up speed with the advent of Reconstruction. The main patterns however, usually involved movement north into the more industrialized sectors of the country. West Virginia had benefited from a small oil boom during the mid-1860s which foreshadowed the coal mining and industries that soon became a large part of the new state's identity. The industrial revolution was just beginning in the South in 1870, but, West Virginia's economy had collapsed into mostly subsistence farming around the same time. Thus, though the large coal deposits under the Appalachian Plateau were a draw for the large mining companies that flocked to the region, it was the cheap labor provided by the poverty-stricken West Virginians that provided the strongest reason for the companies to invest in the area. The optimism exhibited in The West Virginia Handbook belies the generally poor conditions of most inhabitants of the state at that time. Though a burgeoning economy would sweep most of the nation into new prosperity, West Virginia would remain one of the poorest and less developed states in America."],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":14858,"lat":39.2111004793,"lng":-81.5150237232,"zoom":9,"place":"WOOD, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3544,"title":"Mississippi Railroad Development\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-06-15","end_date":"1854-06-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1854, the central portion of Mississippi was still rural, and the road systems were","definitely sparse.

Colonel Edward Lloyd of Virginia had one such vision that he would operate a plantation in Mississippi from Virginia, and its sole purpose would be for monetary gain.  After deciding on his plan, and acquiring the land in Mississippi, he appointed John Hargon to be the overseer on the plantation in Lloyd's absence.  This was not uncommon, and most people made money from such a venture.      Given the nature of the business, though, there will undoubtedly be problems with the plantation.  Hargon dated one letter to Lloyd as October 24, 1850.  There was a problem with the shipment of cotton from the plantation on the Pearl River, which runs through Yazoo County in central Mississippi.  Hargon said that the Freight are 125 c/bale   and only one boat which carry about 400 bale makes a trip once a week when they receive 500 bales a day.  Lloyd faces a predicament that was not unique to his situation.  He put a plantation in an underdeveloped area of Mississippi, and now he cannot ship his cotton to the market. ","At the same time, Hargon was forced to work harder for profits.  Stanley Engerman illustrates the pressure for plantation overseers to reap higher and higher profits.  Lloyd wanted to get the biggest profit for his investment, which forced Hargon to use fresh, undeveloped soil. This soil was farther away from the established commerce routes, and so leads to the predicament in which Hargon found himself.  Engerman states that this expansion helped as well as hurt the plantation owners in the exact way Lloyd and Hargon illustrate.  The greater production is not immediately met with greater transportation capacity, especially in areas that are not near a railroad.  The venture for slave holders wishing to run a plantation from afar was still profitable, but due to the economic circumstances of the southwest, the true profits would have to wait until the transportation industry catches up with the plantations' expansion."],"display_date":"October 24, 1850","search_date":"1850-10-24","locations":[{"id":7158,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3547,"title":"Albert Brown Defends the Homestead Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-04-28","end_date":"1852-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Before Congress ratified it, the Homestead Bill was a hotly contested piece of legislation. The Homestead Act eventually gave approximately 160 acres of undeveloped land in the west to any man of twenty one years, on the condition that he must build a house of 12 x 14 feet and live on the property for five years.  This would not be a problem for people to fulfill who are coming looking for a life on the frontier.  Albert G. Brown, when he gave this speech on April 28, 1852, was a Senator from the state of Mississippi.  He was a democrat, and believed that the frontier should be settled.  As the Homestead Bill came to the forefront of the Congressional debate, he felt it was his duty as a Mississippian and a Senator to stand up for what he thought would benefit his constituents, the South, and the country as a whole.  People were afraid that this would bring in an influx of foreign immigrants, but he put that opinion down, and turned it around to seem as a beneficial piece of legislation for the North, which immigrants already overpopulate.  Brown though that the Homestead Bill would eventually spread out the immigration from foreign countries, and alleviate the immigration problems in the North.

The rest of the South took the opposite view on the merits of increased immigration into the South, and needless to say, theywere not very cordial.

At the time of this particular correspondence, George was in Richmond, Virginia and he was writing back home to Buckingham County, where Benjamin had established himself as a prudent physician and a prosperous community member. This exchange between George and his brother underscores the complexities and anxieties that a nineteenth-century businessman endured on a daily basis, placing particular emphasis on the relationship between creditors and debtors and the complications of relocation.","Benjamin loaned his brother three hundred dollars, no small sum in the 1850s, so that George would have any easier time appeasing his creditors in anticipation of the rearrangement of his business.

Despite the bountiful opportunity available in the booming industry, moving from one location to another carried with it great risks. George was fortunate in that he was able to establish amicable ties with his peers and create good business relationships, but relocation necessitated uprooting oneself from established social networks in the form of valuable connections that may or may not be renewed. Additionally, George's dealings with other relatively wealthy men illustrate one of the spheres of relationships between men in the South; this type of horizontal, commercially driven interaction was generally limited to white, propertied men with sufficient income to live beyond the level of subsistence, though in a few very rare circumstances free blacks were able to rise to the same level of financial independence."],"display_date":"November 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-11-05","locations":[{"id":13690,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3613,"title":"Land not fit for Man or Beast\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-08-03","end_date":"1836-08-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The grass was greener in Virginia.

The letter detailed the hardships of the North Carolina soil and terrain paying toll on the farmers and well being of Robert's brother, Thomas, whom he had left behind to care for the farm when he left for Virginia.  Thomas explained that he does not begrudge Robert for leaving because the land won't improve in North Carolina and not even clover would grow to sustain food for livestock.  There wasn't enough pasture to feed one horse for two weeks, and Thomas's son Andrew was forced to sell his horse.  The horse brought 120, and Thomas took pride in the fact that there weren't many horses of that caliber in the land for sale because most were too thin or blind due to malnutrition.  Livestock was forced to live entirely on a diet of corn because there was no rye worth dealing with.  The struggles of Thomas Anderson were consistent with those occuring on many North Carolina farms because farming practices developed very little from the age of Colonization to the period before the Civil War.  Farmers were still using what historian Henry Watson described as crude and heavy tools, and farming had not progressed into mass production as farmers were forced to raise food for their families and themselves and were incapable of providing for others. Farmers had not yet learned to utilize the concepts of scientific farming to grow more produce or subsistent crops and pasture by using rotation strategies.

This decision was unfortunate for the fashion industry, as purses, reticules, traveling bags, and footwear were all accessories that could be made out of alligator hide. Apparently, it was fashion's mandate to do so. In Louisiana and Florida, their abundance of alligators added an extra boom in their economy and helped support this fashion craze. However, alligators preyed on muskrats who would eat the crops in the area. The decline of the alligator population led to an increase in the population of muskrats, thus seriously damaging the crops. The Police Jury was so serious about this prohibition that they would fine anyone killing an alligator a penalty of 25 and put them in prison for a month for each offense. Clearly, the ban on killing alligators was not an example of animal rights activism. The banning in Plaquemines was economically and financially motivated.","While this instance could be deemed an early example of animal rights protection, it is much more likely that it is a case of Louisiana protecting its economy. Without their crops, Louisiana, much like many other states of the South, had nothing. Later in the nineteenth century, prices of farm products were consistently low. Poverty was widespread throughout Louisiana's farming population already, and without the alligators there to prey on the muskrats, their crops and income were being hurt even more. Farmers' Alliances were formed to help combat these financial issues. However, at this time, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and they essentially stood for white power, while the Farmers' Alliances consisted of mostly black farmers. During 1890, the People's Party was beginning to form, which was supported mainly by farmers in the South. It was similar to the Greenback Labor Party which had formed during the 1880s and opened the door to the concept of populism, which is the appeal to the common person and, likewise, incorporates a sense of working class activism. The Police Jury's response to the alligator situation was in direct correlation with the ideals of the People's Party and populism. The area was much more densely populated with poor farmers, struggling to make enough money to live, than rich people, who would be deeply upset by the absence of alligator purses. Only the wealthier half of the population in the state and the country could afford luxuries such as those. Therefore, the mandate to forbid killing alligators was both necessary and logical. Crops bring in much more money to the states economy than the alligator fashion trend, so sacrificing that fad makes much more sense for the sake of the states' financial well-being."],"display_date":"April 26, 1890","search_date":"1890-04-26","locations":[{"id":5620,"lat":29.1168615299,"lng":-89.3283829847,"zoom":8,"place":"PLAQUEMINES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3634,"title":"Convicts Sent to Work on Plantations\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"12/4/00","end_date":"12/4/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In December of 1900, the Board of Control of the Louisiana State Penitentiary held a meeting in which they decided to set aside two immense plantations in West Feliciana and Iberia Parish for convicts to work. Cotton would be grown on the West Feliciana plantation, while sugar would be grown on the one in Iberia Parish. Approximately five hundred workers were expected to work on these plantations, which is roughly half of the amount of convicts in the state. All of the crops produced from these plantations would end up going to the state, helping to pay for road construction and the like. The program was expected to enact extensive prison reforms after the convict lease system had been abolished.","Convicts working on plantations in Louisiana were characteristic of a productive penalty system that had been taking place in the South for the past 40 years. After the emancipation of slaves in the thirteenth amendment in 1863, farmers, businessmen, and anybody who had used slave labor in their homes needed to find other people to take their place and keep their lives in order. At the same time, many state penitentiaries realized that they could use their prisoners, who were generally black males, to their benefit - having them work for the state. The Convict Lease System, which was put into place throughout the South quickly after slavery had been abolished, was a method of aiding previous slave owners in maintaining their pre-abolition lifestyle and helping the state pay off the cost of prison administration. Farmers and businessmen needed to find replacements for their lacking labor force and convicts were the perfect solution. People using convict labor would then pay the state for their work. This example of convict leasing is especially unique because the state set aside plantations of its own for the prisoners to work, as opposed to leasing them out to private owners. The convict leasing system proved to be very profitable for the government and any business owners who utilized it. Revenues from the program contributed to over 300% of the costs of prison administration. Not only would convicts work on plantations, they would also repair roads, maintain farms, and do other work similar to that of a slave's. However, states slowly phased out of this method of penalty. The system was frequently abused because the convicts, who were mostly African American and male, were readily available and treated inhumanely, similar to the way slaves had been treated before emancipation. Southern states slowly phased out of using this system and it was finally dismantled in 1928."],"display_date":"December 4, 1900","search_date":"1900-12-04","locations":[{"id":5786,"lat":30.8801785658,"lng":-91.420930249,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3645,"title":"Steamship Lines of Norfolk, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-12-11","end_date":"1823-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The American Beacon and Norfolk and Portsmouth Daily Advertiser</em> of Thursday, December 11, 1823 contained two advertisements that concerned a new technology that would greatly change the speed with which Americans traveled their vast continent. Both advertisements concerned the establishment of steamship lines from Norfolk to important cities in the Chesapeake Bay region. The first of the two ads described the services available from the Baltimore Steam Boat Line which operated two ships, the Virginia and the Norfolk. The two ships offered voyages from Norfolk to Baltimore twice a week. The other advertisement of note in the Beacon concerned the weekly voyages of the steamship Potomac. This vessel plied a Chesapeake circuit, beginning in Washington, D.C. and stopping at Alexandria, Virginia before heading south to Norfolk. After stopping in Norfolk, the ship continued up the James River to harbors at City Point and Richmond, Virginia. The whole circuit took exactly one week, but the passenger could choose to ride any portion of it he or she desired, each segment of the trip of costing a different price. The fares ranged from 4 to 11 and included food and drink during the voyage. Although the price may have been a bit steep for the average Norfolk resident, steam travel made the voyage from Washington to Norfolk last only a little over a day.","The 1820s saw the emergence of steamboat travel on the Chesapeake Bay. Although in the early part of the decade, steamboats did little to affect the business of packet ships, they certainly attracted the attention of the citizens of port cities who noted both the curious sight of the little boats with their steam-belching smokestacks as well as the regularity with which the infant steam lines were able to provide services. Steamers such as the Virginia, the Norfolk, and the Potomac constituted this first wave of passenger steamers that began to appear all over the Chesapeake in the first few years of the 1820s. Slowly but surely, stubborn Chesapeake planters also began to realize the value of this mode of transportation that could be depended upon to get their harvests to port within one day in a variety of weather conditions. ","Technological advances like steamship travel and the later advent of rail travel in the 1830s contributed to the emergence of American tourism and the formulation of a distinct American culture. By the 1820s and 1830s, these advancements combined with a growing interest in America's natural attractions and a wealthy population resulted in the growth of American tourism. The construction of turnpikes led to more comfortable and faster stagecoach services, while steamboat travel made water routes both a faster and more reliable option. However, the price of travel in the early nineteenth century often deterred all but the wealthy. "," Tourism also changed how Americans viewed their relationship to the land. The formation of an American culture was greatly tied to American's perceptions of the landscape. Sears writes that from the beginning Americans had sought their identity in their relationship to the land they had settled. In the 1820s and 1830s, tourist attractions helped the young nation cultivate a sense of national culture in a country without the centuries-long traditions of Europe. In essence, tourism provided a means of defining America as a place and taking pride in the special features of its landscape."],"display_date":"December 11, 1823","search_date":"1823-12-11","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3648,"title":"Settling the Debts of Robert Riddick\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-12-13","end_date":"1827-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 13, 1819, Joseph Prentis took over as the Executor of the will of the late Robert M. Riddick of Nansemond County due to the death of the named executor, Thomas Swepson. Mr. Riddick's will called for the disposal of his estate for the payment of his debts. However, Riddick stipulated that in order to raise the deficiency [the Executor was] fully authorized and requested to mortgage the lands and to hire out the slaves for the purpose. For the next eight years, Mr. Prentis hired out Riddick's slaves to neighboring farmers in order to pay off the debts of the deceased. At the time of his death, Robert Riddick owned eighteen slaves. This number, while not huge, was quite substantial and suggested a sizable agricultural operation. Although, when one looks at Mr. Prentis' description of the slaves and the value he placed on each, one can see that perhaps the number alone can be a bit misleading. ","Of the eighteen slaves Mr. Prentis listed in his account book on December 31, 1819, only six were adult males. Furthermore, of those six only two were considered valued over 300 and one of those, Tom Bray valued at 350, was well past his prime at forty-eight years of age. However, Armistead was valued at 500 because he was only eighteen years of age and presumably had a whole lifetime of labor in front of him. The only other male slave close to the value of Tom Bray and Armistead was a man named Jacob, described by Prentis as a small and weakly fellow forty two years old. The other three men were worthless or close to it. Dempsey, valued at 100, was approaching at fifty-five years old. The remaining two, Mingo and Jimmy, both were appraised at 0. Mingo was around seventy years old and very diseased having lost one eye and nearly blind in the other while Jimmy was about sixty years of age and listed as very decrepit. The twelve other slaves that constituted Robert Riddick's property were all adult females and their small children. Of these there were three adult women appraised at 300 or higher. These three were all between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-nine years old, prime childbearing ages."," Further reading into the account book of Mr. Prentis reveals that he was able to hire out Mr. Riddick's slaves to pay off the late man's debts, as directed in the will. Naturally, the amount received for each slave hired out makes sense when compared to their values listed earlier. In the year 1820, old Jimmy was hired out for only five dollars. The small and weak Jacob fetched 32.50 while fifty-five year-old Dempsey earned thirty dollars. Although much younger than Tom Bray, Armistead was hired out for 34 while Tom was hired for 55. Though one cannot be sure, this was probably due to the fact that the older Tom had some skill that was in demand by his temporary master."," The story of Robert Riddick, his slaves, and the posthumous management of his estate was a common one in the slave-holding South. Southern slaveholders, while wealthy in land and human property, did not have a lot of capital at their disposal and frequently purchased on credit which often plunged them into debt. The death of a slaveholder required that those debts be settled, and often that was accomplished through the hiring out of slaves to raise the money necessary to pay the creditors. This process was time-consuming but it allowed the late slaveholder's family to retain ownership of the slaves that a quick settlement of the estate (i.e. the auction of the slaves) would not accomplish. The amount of time it took to pay off the debts of a deceased slaveholder through the hiring of his slave property could vary greatly depending upon the size of his debts and the sex, age, and physical condition of his slaves. For example, the job of settling Riddick's debts may have taken less time if half of his slaves had been young, healthy males like Armistead. Richard Randolph a Prince Edward County slaveholder discussed in Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, owned a great number of slaves that were to be manumitted upon his death. However, his wife kept them in bondage for a further ten years until the debts could be settled. The fact that slaveholders were willing to wait years to pay off debts through slave-hiring speaks to the value of slave property in the antebellum South. Southerners would rather wait than loose their property forever in a quick sale."],"display_date":"December 13, 1819 - December 31, 1827","search_date":"1823-12-22","locations":[{"id":14070,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3651,"title":"Improvements to the Dismal Swamp Canal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-11-17","end_date":"1819-11-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 17, 1819, the Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald rejoiced in reporting the news that the new and improved Dismal Swamp Canal was nearing completion and was soon to be ready for traffic. The Canal was undergoing a process of deepening and widening so that it could accommodate the traffic of larger vessels. To the Herald, the traffic on the Dismal Swamp Canal was the lifeblood of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, to whom their very existence depended. The improvements to the Canal were slowed by winter weather and heavy late summer rains, but by November the Canal was once again filled with Boats incessantly passing and repassing, laden with the produce of the country, or with foreign merchandize, present[ing] a continued scene of industry and activity as far as the eye can reach, and impress[ing] the mind of the beholder with a clear conception of the importance of this great commercial thoroughfare.","The Dismal Swamp is a great expanse of soggy land comprising over 100,000 acres in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Though early settlers realized the land was practically useless for farming, it was bestowed with another valuable resource: timber. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington formed the Dismal Swamp Company with the intention of digging a canal into the interior of the swamp so that this resource could be better utilized. The canal he constructed was a small one and it became to be known as Washington's Ditch. Later, Washington's Canal was replaced by wider and deeper waterways. The canal was important to the economy of the region because of the timber it transported out of the swamp as well as the produce that traveled through the swamp from North Carolina on its way to Norfolk and Suffolk, Virginia. The goods that were transported on the Dismal Swamp Canal were vital to the economy of eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia.","The 1820s saw an explosion of canal building in the United States of which the Dismal Swamp Canal was a part. Along with the Erie Canal and the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, the Dismal Swamp Canal was seen as an important economic link between the coast and the interior. As well as providing coastal markets for interior goods, these canals also served to connect states and regions in commerce, accelerating the economic growth of the period. Finally, these waterways were often the proving grounds for new technologies like the steamboat. In all, canals like the Dismal Swamp Canal factored greatly in the economic and technological development of the young nation."],"display_date":"November 17, 1819","search_date":"1819-11-17","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3668,"title":"Northern Neck of Virginia Desires Immigrants\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Board of Immigration from the counties of Richmond, Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland assembled to compose their forthcoming pamphlet enticing immigrants to their regions of Virginia: ...our earnest desire is to attract to it and immigration not only from the northern and north-western states, but also from Canada and Europe.

Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones.

To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes.

This person was no established politician providing aid for victims of the Irish Potato Famine; instead, he was a small five-year-old boy named Joseph Klemm. When Joseph's mother read him one disturbing account from Ireland, his first instinct was to run and get his moneybox. After returning with it, Joseph informed his mom that he was going to carry his money to the man in charge of collecting donations to send to damaged families in Ireland so that his money could be used to feed and clothe the little boys in Ireland. The story of little Joseph is priceless, despite its obvious intention of boosting public awareness and aid to the devastated country. The boy took all of his savings, one hundred and three cents, and gave it all away with the best intentions. The author described in detail Joseph's sparkling eyes, claiming that they showed the workings of a truly generous heart. The author of the article felt that this story was an important account to convey to the public, declaring that such acts deserve to be noticed and commended. He also observed another little boy being entertained by the same story, read by his father just like little Joseph, the boy asked if he too could give his money away to help those in foreign lands.Though relief aid was vital and absolutely necessary for reconstructing the Irish economy, there were numerous disadvantageous circumstances that arose, even with massive amounts of foreign funds pouring in. L. P. Curtis' incumbered wealth illustrates some of these problems. Curtis states that both landlords and tenants depended on an elaborate and secretive system of short and long-term goals. Furthermore, in the post famine period, after the rural economy had become completely monetized, virtually every tenant farmer owed money to someone at one time or another. Despite these shortcomings, it was still acceptable to feel the way Joseph and the other little boy did during such a crisis. After all, it was benevolent acts like these that built up America's character in the eyes of nations worldwide.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3846,"title":"Agricultural Survival and Wealth\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-02","end_date":"1856-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 2, 1856 in western Virginia, Congressman John Letcher wrote a letter to his friend Alexander H.H. Stuart, who was also a politician.  Letcher was born in Lexington, where he owned a law firm and began his political career.  He later served as the governor of Virginia beginning in 1859.  Stuart, on the other hand, was born in nearby Staunton where he was greatly involved with politics.   Although both of these men were politicians, they also owned land that they farmed.  In his letter to Stuart, Letcher seemed very concerned that Stuart had received some particular seeds for his farm.  These seeds were more than likely either wheat or corn because these two crops were the most popular in the Shenandoah Valley.  Also, Letcher showed much interest in making sure the seeds pleased Stuart.","This letter proves how much agriculture was important to the South.  Even though the two men were politicians, they depended on agriculture to supply food for their families as well as wealth to further their political careers.  Farming provided economic and social well-being for many other families in the South.  Without farms many people would not have been able to survive.  Particularly in western Virginia, much of the most fertile land was depleted, so many families resorted to subsistence farming.  They also tried to grow enough crops to profit from their hard labor.  The Stuart family was definitely one of these families who practiced both for-profit and subsistence farming.  The great concern for the delivery of the seeds demonstrates how these seeds were important.  The Stuart family needed these seeds to continue the preservation of their family.  They needed the seeds for food and to sell their crops on the market.     ","  Congressman John Letcher knew the situation of his friend and fellow politician because he was also in the same position.  Letcher hailed from Rockbridge County where agriculture played a similar role as it did in Augusta.  Letcher and his family practiced subsistence as well as market-based farming just like the Stuarts.  Numerous Southern families, such as the Letchers and Stuarts, relied on agriculture to provide food for the family and to represent the family's entire economic well-being.

Mercer kept a concise diary of daily activities. His diary consists of the condition of agriculture, weather, and his social life. Mercer was an ordinary Maryland yeoman farmer. As a yeoman farmer he relied on family and never mentioned the use of slave labor, except that of hired servants. He grew Maryland's first staple crop of tobacco as well as wheat. Wheat soon become more of a demand and his varied crops brought him greater wealth. Controlling a modest amount of land, as with most yeoman farmers, Mercer showed how non-slaveholding farmers lived their lives. Most people in the South were not massive plantation owners, but yeoman like Mercer. His daily life tells historians a lot about the ordinary men of the South.","Most of his days were spent planting and tending to his tobacco crop, which was labor-intensive, but Mercer also planted and harvested wheat.  Before the harvest of his wheat crop he would solicit the help of a hired \"servant.\" On June 27, 1857, he hired a servant man Jacob, from Miss Town, for eight dollars per month. A few days later he completed his wheat harvest of 336 pounds, which sold for 72 dollars. As historian Barbara Fields states, \"wheat required maximum work force at harvest,\" so Mercer most likely hired the free man Jacob to help harvest the wheat crop. He also hired other men during the year to help in tobacco cultivation.","Mercer's greatest enemy was the weather coupled with the \"eat worm,\" as he called it. The tobacco worm, which could eat a large plant in several hours, plagued the farmer. He wrote on June 18, 1857, that the \"eat worm destroyed many tobacco plants.\" Besides the eat worm, Mercer was at the weather's mercy. He began every entry stating the condition of the weather.  Since he was economically dependent upon the success of his crops the weather played a major part in his life. Exceptionally nasty storms were accounted for in greater detail than the average \"clean\" day.","Mercer did not spend all his days working hard in his fields; he had a social life as well. Along with his wife, Mercer would frequently visit Washington D.C. several times a month for fun and family affairs. While away, servants tended to the crops. Even though he left the work to his servants, Mercer was not a harsh or cruel man. His workers received \"holidays\" after harvest seasons and no one worked on Sundays. Thomas Mercer did not have an exceptionally interesting life, but he managed his farm and family well and never complained.

In <em>The Mariner's Chronicle</em>, one gentleman on board described the scene in the boiler room as a \"complete wreck - a picture of destruction\".  He witnessed one man with \"the whole of the forehead blown away: the brains were still beating.  Tufts of hair, shreds of clothing, and splotches of blood might be seen in every direction\".  Outside the boiler room \"on every side were to be heard groans and mingled exclamations of grief and despair\" as men and women dealt with the injured.  One man's face \"was entirely black; his body without a particle of skin.  He had been flayed alive\".  To witness such horrors - fellow passengers in pain, near death, and begging for death to \"free them from present suffering\" - devastated the survivors.  The gentleman judged that between forty and fifty people perished either instantly, from injury, from inhaling steam or gas, or from drowning.  "," No doubt people faced danger when traveling during the 19th century.   John Burke in \"Bursting Boilers and Federal Power\" stated that between 1816 and 1848 about 233 steamboat explosions occurred.  The lack of regulation on the boilers at that time contributed to most of the accidents.  Steamboat explosions caused the loss of goods affecting the economy as well as the loss of lives affecting each individual and each family.  Ultimately, the loss of lives and goods played a crucial role in affecting American history.  The number of lives lost compelled American legislation to question how steamboats could become safer and whether federal power had the right to create regulatory agencies.    ","In 1824, the <em>Gibbons v Ogden</em> ruling handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that \"the power to regulate commerce, so far as it extends, is exclusively vested in Congress\" allowing Congress to regulate private business and to interfere where government had never interfered before.  As more steamboat explosions killed more lives, the American people reacted.  In 1830, Secretary of Treasury Samuel D. Ingham gave money to The Franklin Institute to experiment and inspect steam engine boilers.  The combination of the number of deaths due to explosions and the data from the experiments forced the Steamboat Act of 1838 to become law.  The Steamboat Act of 1852 established the Steamboat Inspection Service, one of the first federal agency to regulate private industry, allowing the Act of 1838 to be enforced by a government agency.  Aside from safer traveling, the impact of this legislation still affects Americans.  John Ward in \"The Future of an Explosion\" further explained, \"From that distant carnage on the rivers of the West came the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and all the other government regulatory and investigative agencies that seek to protect us today\".  A steamboat explosion occurring in 1830 changed the lives of Americans far after other transportation replaced steamboats.  The loss of human life makes a difference."],"display_date":"February 24, 1830","search_date":"1830-02-24","locations":[{"id":12366,"lat":35.2121822757,"lng":-89.8820367379,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3932,"title":"An Editorial on the End of the Civil War in Charleston\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-22","end_date":"1865-07-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 22, 1865, in Charleston, South   Carolina, a man by the pen-name of Juhl wrote an editorial in the <em>Charleston Courier </em>describing many elements of city life in the post-Civil War period. The writer's real name was Reverend Julius J. Fleming, a prominent and outspoken citizen of Charleston widely respected for his roles as a preparatory school principal, a Methodist preacher, and earlier in his life, as the editor of the <em>Sumter Watchman</em>, a Charleston area newspaper. More importantly, however, the editorial Fleming penned shows a distinct knowledge of the fundamental problem that plagued Reconstruction South Carolina.","In the editorial letter that he penned in the <em>Courier</em>,<em> </em>one of dozens that he would write during his lifetime, Fleming addressed many problems that the Civil War had laid on South Carolina. In particular, Fleming's message also posed two significant queries relevant to the safety and survival of Southern culture: \"How can<em> </em>peace and quiet be permanently secured?\" and \"How and where will farmers find an adequate, reliable labor force?\" ","Interestingly enough, both of Fleming's questions hinged on one all-important aspect of Southern lifestyle, the slave labor agricultural system that had existed for nearly two hundred years at the time of the Civil War. Fleming, in his editorial, described slavery as \"the life-blood of secession and the real <em>casus belli</em> [cause of war],\" thereby showing that slavery's end was to be the single largest hardship faced during Reconstruction. On this note, he claimed that \"by one sweep the wealth of the country is taken away, and a people accustomed to wealth and ease are suddenly reduced to poverty, humiliation and toil.\" Fleming's idea of South Carolina's economic ruin as a result of emancipation was later supported by Civil War historian W. Scott Poole, who cited the disappearance of \"enormous wealth, founded as it had been on a now defunct social system.\"","There is no doubt that both questions Fleming posed were difficult ones to answer, especially considering the Union Army had freed a gigantic number of former slaves during their march through South Carolina. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the author developed several sensible answers to uncertainties faced not only in South Carolina, but the South as a whole, in his landmark editorial. Among these suggestions, Fleming's envisioned arrangement for agricultural change was particularly impressive, and featured a version of sharecropping in which wealthy planters would \"divide up a portion of their estates into small farms which emigrants can readily obtain by purchase or lease.\"  In the post-war South, Fleming's system was put to use on a large scale, and it lasted into the twentieth century. ","Across his editorial, Fleming displayed an acute knowledge of the problems to be faced as the result of slavery's demise in post-Civil War South Carolina. While there is no question that Fleming's editorial addressed on one hand \"a people picking up the pieces of an existence shattered and changed by war and defeat,\" there is also no question as to the overarching theme of his letter. This motif, of course, was not disquiet or misery, but rather an appreciation that \"the war [was] over never to be renewed.\""],"display_date":"July 22, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-22","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3942,"title":"Farming Tips from a Farmer\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-11-18","end_date":"1852-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"Give the boys tools of the best kind and where practicable, let them be adopted in size to their strength and capacity for handling them.\"  This was just one of the many tips presented in a farming advice column in the <em>Roanoke Beacon</em> on November 18, 1852.  The newspaper contained many other written editorials that expressed people's opinions.  The advice in this column, however, was more credible for others to read and follow because another farmer wrote the article.  As the quote suggests, every farm needed good quality tools to be efficient.  Along with good tools, good labor was the key to a productive farm.  Young, strong slaves made up this good labor force.  The article stated that in order to have a productive farm, one had to choose the best available slaves.  Owners must then treat their slaves with at least some care to keep them healthy.  A healthy labor force was an efficient one, according to the article.  Slave labor and good tools were the first steps to improving a farm's production.","This article demonstrated the importance of agriculture in Virginia and in the South at the time.  Agriculture drove the Southern economy, and it depended on a slave labor force.  In particular, there were 2,510 slaves in 1850 in Roanoke County; that number increased to 2,643 slaves in 1860.  Slaves were necessary for the Southern economy to work and function properly.  Slaves were so vital to the Southern way of life that they made up over thirty-six percent of the population of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South  Carolina, and Georgia.

Pinckney, a plantation owner in South Carolina, did not expect these men to continue working for free, but he realized that without them, his plantation was destined for failure. He stated simply, \"I acknowledged their freedom; did not expect them to work on the old terms, but would pay them for their labor, etc.\" Pinckney respected the knowledge of the land and agricultural work that these men had acquired while working for him, and for this reason he wished them to stay on his plantation. After his request, Pinckney received a largely negative response from these former slaves. Acknowledging their rights as free men, Pinckney told them that if they were to stay on his land they would have to work for him, but they were free to go wherever they wanted. The slaves found themselves in a frustrating bind. Fearing the failure of the federal paper currency (greenbacks), they wished to work for themselves instead of Pinckney employing them. They questioned the actions of the government, asking \"what good does it do for the government to give us our freedom and not give us land to plant?\" Pinckney, probably like most former plantation owners, was equally frustrated because his livelihood relied on the productivity of his plantation, and he could not possibly do all the work himself. ","    The free men did begin to work, but \"it was only starvation that brought them to it.\" Without any land, they could not provide food for themselves or their families, so they had to work under whatever conditions Pinckney offered. On Pinckney's plantation they were \"generally forced to adopt the share system.\" This share system became common throughout the South in the years following the war. In the early stages, the plantation remained the most common unit with free men working on it for a share of the crops, but soon enough a true sharecropping system developed. Black men were granted pieces of land to work, and when the year was over the owners returned to them a share of the crop produced. By 1870 sharecropping was so common in the South that it made any other system seem unusual. Sharecropping did not, however, allow the South to develop any more industry or diversify any more than it had under the plantation system, leaving it lagging far behind the North for many years to come."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3952,"title":"The Interstate Slave Trade\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-03","end_date":"1832-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["        The <em>Alexandria Gazette</em>, a newspaper of Alexandria, Virginia, published a small advertisement for \"200 Negroes\" on December 3, 1832.

Being sold to the Deep South was possibly one of the greatest fears of many Upper or Border South slaves. The prospect of being sold away from family and friends was considered by some, a worse punishment than whipping. ","            According to historian William W. Freehling, economic growth, booming land sales, and the invention of the cotton gin encouraged the interstate slave trade as cotton was very profitable and grew more productively in more tropical climates. Freehling also notes that \"between 1790 and 1860, Border and Middle Souths lost close to 750,000 slaves.\"  This drain was especially prevalent in the 1850s cotton boom, comprising a substantial percentage of the slave population of these states. In comparison, after the \"tobacco bust of the eighteenth century,\" the Border South was much more industrial, grew a wider variety of crops, and was more economically diversified and willing to sell their slaves \"down the river\" for a high profit. Most slaveholding southerners claimed to look down on these slave traders who made transactions possible, but according to historian Jeanette Keith, Isaac Franklin and his partner John Armfield were two of the most affluent and successful slave traders in the United   States. They later retired wealthy, purchased their own plantations, and married into elite families in Tennessee. They were also prominent Methodists. Many factors encouraged the slave trade during the 1820s and 1830s. Economics and profit to be gained in the cotton boom provided ample reason for traders to invest in this market.

One specific article presented the news of a new tariff bill to be passed by the United States House of Representatives.  This bill was designed to protect young American manufacturers and the economy from competing foreign markets.  The article also gave insight into the fact that many Rockbridge  County residents were unsure the new bill would protect industry and decrease the treasury's debt at the same time.  They hoped the bill would not pass through the House because the tariff would hurt their agricultural society.  The residents believed it was unintelligent to tax foreign imports that Americans had no way of producing themselves, such as coffee.  Moreover, with the passing of this bill United States manufacturers could then charge American consumers, like the Rockbridge County residents, higher prices.  According to the article, this tariff would help the Northern economy but harm the South.  ","There have been many such bills throughout the history of the United   States, especially in the years after Reconstruction.  All of them had the same goal of protecting the domestic economy.  The dispute over tariffs boiled down to the Northern Republicans against the Southern Democrats.  The Republicans claimed they were protecting American industry but they were actually protecting themselves, since Republican voters owned the majority of the industrial United States.  Democrats countered with the fact that tariffs only brought harm to the South. Southerners had to buy imported goods at high prices and they had to buy expensive domestic goods as well because American manufacturers were raising their prices in response to no foreign competition.  In addition, Southerners had difficulty selling their agricultural goods in an angry foreign market.  The Southern Democrats fought hard against any and all tariffs because they knew it was the key to the South's survival.

Brooks wrote these words in 1891, fifty-six years and 400,000,000 bushels of oysters after the beginning of commercial oyster revolution.  The natural beds of the Chesapeake were being depleted so rapidly that Brooks predicted a complete extinction of \"a free gift from bounteous nature.\"  \"Our indifference and lack of foresight, and our blind trust in our natural advantages, have brought this grand inheritance to the verge of ruin.\"  Despite this, Brooks believed that there was a solution: oyster harvesting.  \"An army\" of laborers must assemble and begin farming oysters, just as one would grow wheat or cotton. According to Brooks, \"our opportunities for rearing oysters are unparalleled in any other part of the world.\"  The seed for future economic and financial improvement had been planted.","            In 1895, James B. Baylor submitted to the governor of Virginia an idea based on the 439-page survey of the \"natural oyster beds, rocks and shoals\" that would not only revive the oyster industry but also bring significant funds to the ailing Virginia treasury.  Of the entire Chesapeake Bay, only 201,216.3 acres were considered to be natural oyster beds.  Outside of this, however, remained 400,000 acres of \"barren area\" that, under Section 2137 of the Code of Virginia, could be subdivided and rented to farmers for cultivation.  Baylor suggested a series of laws that, through the mandatory use of \"labor-saving appliances\" (acquired from states such as Maryland, which already had an established system of deep-water oyster harvesting) and the implementation of license taxes, would greatly improve the oyster industry and significantly increase state revenue.  Not only would everyone in the Commonwealth benefit from these laws, but also the success of oyster harvesting, which those in William Brooks' day feared might end, could be guaranteed for generations to come.  ","            Since these times, \"the shellfish aquaculture industry in Virginia has added significant value to the State's seafood marketplace.\"  Even today, notes the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, \"watermen continue to harvest both hard clams and oysters from the State's public resources.\"  Were it not for the efforts of the scientists of the late nineteenth century, however, the entire shellfish industry might have perished.

Following the cigar manufacturers' strike in Key  West that same year, Florida was forced to recognize cigars as a major agricultural product.  The opportunities that the cigar industry offered, as well as the profits, made cigar factories in Florida as valuable as tobacco plantations in colonial Jamestown.  In <em>Old South, New South</em>, Gavin Wright contends that \"the interest in keeping the southern labor market isolated disappeared after the Civil War, giving the forces that sought to promote industrial development the upper hand, and tending to integrate the southern labor market into the national one.\"  Such integration of the southern economy into the northern economy after the Civil War explains the success of cigar factories and why they became so significant to southern economy in the nineteenth century. ","As stated by Wright, the \"New South's\" dependence on industrialization forced cigar manufacturers to look elsewhere for employment after the 1890 strike in Key West.  They shifted their focus from Key West to cities like Tampa, Punta Gorda, and Charlotte  Harbor in hopes of gaining access to more job opportunities.  ","The shift in the focus of the cigar factories caused the surrounding cities to set their sights on securing lands for the cigar industry.  The article urged each town to secure at least one or two factories.  Key West launched this local project in order to draw attention to the new direction that the state was pursuing in regards to the growing cigar industry.  The large-scale manufacturing activities of the cigar industry in Florida made cigars a very important financial resource.  ","Paula Harper, associate professor at the University of Miami, traced the beginnings of the booming cigar industry to the \"exodus\" of Cubans into Key West near the start of the nineteenth century.  From there, the cigar industry became extremely pivotal in the economic, social, and political aspects of nineteenth century Florida.  This continued to be a trend until the mid-twentieth century, when cigar consumption severely declined.  The successful industrial transition from the \"Old South\" to the \"New South\" can be explained by the success of industries like cigar manufacturing.  Such an explanation allowed the \"most backward and impoverished section of the United States\" to equal the productivity of its northern counterpart."],"display_date":"January 1, 1890","search_date":"1890-01-01","locations":[{"id":1432,"lat":24.6544423073,"lng":-81.6949104117,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4018,"title":"Texans Begin to Encourage the Spread of the Peculiar Institution\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-08-25","end_date":"1861-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    \"My brother John D. Andrews of Houston, Texas, requests me to say to the people of Va, that he would like to exchange lands in Texas for Negroes,\" was the opening line of an August 25, 1861 sale notice drafted by Samuel Andrews of behalf of his brother, John Andrews, who resided in Houston, Texas.  In the ad, Andrews discussed his willingness to negotiate with Virginians who wished to \"send their Negroes to Texas, in farming there, from one to ten years... and divide the net profits on just and equitable proportions.\" It seemed as if Andrews was attempting to start some type of business or partnership with slave owners in Virginia, and the tone of his writing alluded to the idea that his plan was one that had been implemented and been successful among other agricultural entrepreneurs. Andrews' proposition illustrated the desire of those residing in the new frontier lands of the Southwest to make both slavery and agriculture profitable in an area that many people hoped would become the new South. Just as it seems that John Andrews had done, in the years following Thomas Jefferson's acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, many Americans began moving west into the frontier in hopes of gaining more land as well as finding the agricultural success that many plantation owners had found in the American South. Settlers began stretching across the midwestern section of the United States into areas such as Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. Although many do not generally associate slavery with the Lone Star state, it was a very large institution in the region. In the 1850s, the proportion of slaveholders to slaves in Texas was comparable to that in Virginia, the oldest slave state in the Union."," As early as 1833 people were beginning to see Texas as a potential slave state when Stephen F. Austin claimed that \"Texas must be slave country. Circumstances and unavoidable necessity compels it. It is the wish of the people there, and it is my duty to do all I can, prudently in favor of it. I will do so.\" In the early 1840s, people began to realize that Texas served as a great source of rich soil for farming and attracted the attention of upper South slaveholders such as Andrews. As the years went on, it became evident that slavery was going to be a very large part of the growth and prosperity in the new state. It was this fact, and this connection to the South through the peculiar institution of slavery, that would solidify Texas' allegiance as the nation began to rush towards the Civil War."],"display_date":"August 25, 1861","search_date":"1861-08-25","locations":[{"id":12836,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4021,"title":"Farm for Sale\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-16","end_date":"1856-05-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 16, 1856, John Cooke posted an advertisement in the <em>Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser </em>to sell his farm in King William County, Virginia.

Compiled by Stuart McD. Farrar, the census polled residents of the county on June 30, 1850 and organized the data by household. Each household was numbered and every person who lived in the house was included within the family. Each family had to report every person who lived in the house as well as their gender, age, and place of birth. Additionally, the census reported the value of each estate, occupation of the residents, and the number of slaves on each farm. ","    The information that illustrated what kind of citizens owned slaves revealed much about the social hierarchy of Appomattox County. While most household heads reported their main occupation as either laborer or farmer, very few concluded that they owned more than one slave. In fact, those households that owned at least fifty slaves or more typically reported an additional primary occupation, such as the Flood family, where Henry D. Flood, the head of the family, was an attorney. Additionally, very few masters who owned at least fifty slaves were under the age of fifty. Most families were incredibly young, such as Major and Jettrina Powell, both under age twenty-five. The Powells owned no slaves and resided in Appomattox County as a family starting their new life together.  ","    It is clear from the census that Appomattox County, unlike certain areas of Virginia, was a region of developing infrastructure. While the central Virginia town of Lynchburg had one of the most successful regional tobacco markets, western counties like Appomattox were more focused on self-sufficient farming. Several farms grew tobacco in order to earn more income, but few farmers made a large profit. Competition with the wealthier Virginia counties that produced cash crops was not possible, and so the area was mostly home to families who had established themselves as yeoman farmers.

It was proof that his business relations with an associate, William Tompkins, Sr., had finally bore fruit.  Mr. Tompkins waited over three years to pay James Brady for debts dating back to May 1829.  The large quantities of bacon, corn, nails, and planks had accumulated into a bill of 65.61, no small sum.  Brady let out a sigh of relief.  With this money he could expand his investments into the booming slave trade, which was far more lucrative than five hundred nails at 4.37.  James Brady became a fairly active slave trader, handling not a few transactions in the 1840s and 1850s, due to diligent effort but also to exterior factors. ","With the acquisition of lands of the southwestern frontier from the Creek Indians, Mississippi and Alabama were states by 1819, expanding the influence of the Slave South.  Between this and the ability of the cotton gin to enable a profit from lesser-grade, short-staple Southern cotton rose to the nation's top cash crop by 1830.  Due to the increase in demand for labor and no legal slave importation, deep Southern planters turned to Maryland and Virginia to supply labor.  Merchants like James Brady came into the picture here, buying and selling slaves for a profit on a route between Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.  According to Michael Tadman's <em>Speculators and Slaves</em>, states with large populations like Virginia exported slaves to the expanding southern cotton and (in Louisiana's case) sugar states.  When the international slave trade ended in 1807, dependence on states like Virginia grew greatly, leaving traders like James Brady in a position to turn quite a profit.

Not only did he recount that the preferred beverage of the state was Whiskey, but he was mystified by the details of cooking because the process was all done in a \"separate house called a kitchen.\" What a strange concept to those hailing from the wintry climate of New England, where a trip outdoors to a separate building was absurd The most palpable aspect of Howe's letter, however, is the prominent role of agriculture and climate in central Virginian life. He noted that the \"wheat has come in very well and the prospect for corn is as good as it every was.\" Yet, when he discussed tobacco Howe displayed concern, in that \"the present prospect is promising, but it is a precarious crop.\" After he bemoaned the \"oppressive heat\" in the state, he promised his brother a copy of the Franklin Almanac when the new edition was published. In describing, \"how the Virginians live,\" the New Englander emphasized not their dress or manner, but instead the weather, soil, and crop yields that dictated planter life in the Commonwealth. ","    By the 1820s tobacco had brought wealth to Virginia for two hundred years. Throughout this time period it made its way from the Tidewater region to the Piedmont and became the central economic factor that brought wealth to the state. Howe's discussions of the climate and the Franklin Almanac were common amongst Virginians, who relied so heavily upon agriculture. The Panic of 1819, however, hit the southern states hard. Along with the plummeting of cotton rates came the decline of other agriculture products, including tobacco. Howe understood that Virginians were no longer able to depend on tobacco as a single cash crop. Aside from the concerns of the fluctuating market, tobacco itself depleted the soil and would not grow in the same area for more than three to four years. This made it significantly less profitable when the crop prices were low. According to Joseph A. CotÉ, in the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, a lack of crop diversity was a danger to the \"overall development of the South.\" Virginia farmers came to this same conclusion and shifted to other agricultural endeavors such as wheat and corn to supplant their livelihoods. As hardship became more commonplace, farmers found it necessary to provide food for their families and slaves. Wheat and corn comprised a significant portion of the crops grown throughout the state. After the economic difficulties surrounding the Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812, and most prominently the Panic of 1819, planters could no longer safely rely on the tobacco market to provide for all of their needs.

To Mary she said, \"it will take some time getting used to doing work without slaves, because we don't have any of the conveniences that those living in the North have.\" With the help of machinery and technology that assisted Northern farmers, Sarah thought it would be easier for her cousins to make a trip down to Virginia. Although she wished for her cousins to visit her, Sarah warned Mary that her \"dear old state\" presented anything but a pleasing appearance at that time because of the hardships it faced. ","            Sarah explained that after enduring the war, many people were \"deprived of every cent of property\" and almost everyone was left without money. According to historian Steven Tripp, the economy in the South (specifically Virginia) after the Civil War was perfectly stagnant because of an absolute want of money, a general distrust of federal currency, and the impoverishment of the whole community. ","            Perhaps worse than economic deprivation, the people of the South were \"mourning the loss of one or more friends or seeing them maimed of crippled for life.\" In Sarah's family, four of her sons volunteered in the Confederate armies. Only two returned home safely, while the others were left on the battlefield. Sarah never knew if her sons had a decent burial, and did not receive an official notification of their deaths.","            Although her experience with the Civil War was overwhelming, Sarah remained optimistic for the future of her Southern state. She concluded in her letters, \"I confidently expected we would succeed, but I am resigned to the will of my heavenly father, and He knew what was best for us and that all things will work out at last.\""],"display_date":"June 1, 1870","search_date":"1870-06-01","locations":[{"id":13701,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4080,"title":"Speaking from Medicine Lodge:  Two Native American Opinions on Removal, White Culture, and Government Relations","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-10-19","end_date":"1867-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The Treaty of Medicine Lodge is among the last, most famous and most influential of the United States-Native American treaties.  The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4085,"title":"Freedmen Renew Fears of Rebellion\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-12-04","end_date":"1865-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In December 1865, <em>The Sun</em> in Baltimore reported on a story from the <em>Norfolk Virginian</em> concerning the formation of a militia in Matthews County, Virginia. The war had ended months before, but the men of Matthews County still felt the need to protect themselves. The possibility of an insurrection of the newly autonomous group of freedmen in their area terrified the white men of Matthews County. According to the 1860 and 1870 census, freedmen composed almost one half of the population in Matthews, and if united, they could pose a threat to white landowners. The <em>Norfolk Virginian</em> claimed that \"Negroes [were] ... buying arms wherever they [could] procure them\" and \"uttering serious threats.\" This spirit of revenge was thought to exist in freedmen throughout Virginia and the entire South. Conflicts between the freedmen and whites stemmed from the fact that freedmen did not want to be employed by whites under year-long contracts or other conditions similar to slavery.","White fears of \"Negro domination\" manifested themselves in various ways, such as the formation of a militia in Matthews County, Virginia. In other areas of the South white supremacy groups such as the KKK formed to violently force the black community into submission through violence. Eric Foner discusses the conflicts of implementing a free labor system in the South in his <em>Short History of Reconstruction. </em>Fears of a takeover by blacks existed long before they became freedmen. During slavery, plantation owners lived in constant fear of the possibility of a slave revolt. The Thirteenth Amendment freed the slaves and opened the door to a world of free labor in the southern states. With increasing autonomy in their labor decisions it was plausible that freedmen may seek some sort of revenge on their previous masters. In general, however, most slaves did not desire to seek violent restitution for their time in slavery. Although some freedmen demanded land rights from their masters as payment for their labor during slavery, most focused on reuniting their families, educating themselves, and establishing a black community.  Blacks disliked the year long contracts because they did not allow them to choose the crops they planted and they did not repay them fairly for their labor. Eventually sharecropping emerged as a new form of tenancy that was touted as beneficial to both whites and blacks, and the contract system faded away."],"display_date":"December 4, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-04","locations":[{"id":14039,"lat":37.3887731419,"lng":-76.252448521,"zoom":10,"place":"MATHEWS, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4106,"title":"Manufacturing in post-War Mississippi\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-01","end_date":"1875-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Did we learn anything from the War?  The <em>Natchez Weekly Democrat, </em>a local newspaper located in Natchez,  Mississippi, asked this question of its readers in more polite terms.  In July, 1875, the newspaper lamented the lack of economic development in the form of manufacturing over the previous years in the surrounding area.  Southerners in all parts of the former Confederacy were aware that the lack of manufacturing capability outside of the state of Virginia had given the North too great of an advantage during the war.  Without citing any specific examples, the paper stated that very little had changed about the local economy in the past decade.  ","Besides the obvious lack of slave labor, Natchez and surrounding environs remained largely agricultural, with no significant manufacturing sector to speak of.  An examination of both the 1870 and 1880 United States census data (which measured the amount of capital invested in manufacturing in dollars) supports the newspaper's claim.  In 1870, there was 4,501,714 invested in manufacturing in Mississippi.  Ten years later, this figure had only grown to 4,727,600, an increase of merely 225,886.  This amounts to an increase of approximately five percent over the 1870 level in the following decade, which is far behind usual growth patterns.  This lack of manufacturing growth means that very few new jobs were created.  The livelihoods of former slaves and poor whites were still largely based in agriculture, but they very rarely owned their own land and instead contributed to the vast increase in the practice of sharecropping.  Natchez was far from unusual in the South.  By 1880, the Southern states accounted for roughly the same percentage of industrial development nationwide as they had before the war.  The South's industrial development continued to lag behind the country as a whole and would well into the twentieth century.

The technique that had remained relatively unchanged since Biblical times was, after the wheat was harvested, to have it trodden upon by horses, cattle, or oxen. This practice was slow, tedious, and left dirty grain that only numbered in about five bushels a day per laborer.  However various new patents began to surface for machines that were each driven by a different number of horses which had different amounts of bushels threshed.","A certain Mr. George Wright from Middletown made two versions of a threshing machine in 1821.  Wright designed portable and fixed threshing machines that were made from iron to \"shake off the straw by cylindrical rakes, and clean or fan the grain\".  The portable design was made \"to travel or move about the country to thresh for hire.\"  However the fixed machine was said to be the most effective because it not only takes the wheat from the straw but cleans it as well, whereas the portable just removes the straw.  The machine threshed 35 to 37 bushels in just one hour, a substantial yield compared to the archaic method.  The Wright design did not use any horses, contrary to those popular in England.  The reason for this is that \"it would answer a good purpose if all the horses were of equal strength, which upon a farm, is seldom the case.\"  ","During the pre-industrial boom era, many new inventions began to build steam in rural communities and we very popular among the plantation owning gentry.  An example of another invention during this time is the \"ox-shovel\" that is pulled by oxen and digs up dirt.  Most of these inventions had multiple uses as evident by the fixed threshing machine that separates the straw as well as cleans it.  These machines helped greatly increased the rural economy in Virginia, not only with the upper class but with the lower classes who were given the option of hiring out a portable thresher.  This speaks to the close-knit communities in rural Virginia, in that individuals not only try to help themselves but spread about their new ideas to others while at the same time making a substantial amount of money."],"display_date":"March 16, 1821 - November 2, 1821","search_date":"1821-07-09","locations":[{"id":13835,"lat":39.1445168984,"lng":-78.1775216949,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4164,"title":"Town Improvement Association of Winter Park\n","course_id":9,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-03-03","end_date":"1887-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The city of Winter Park was established in 1881 as a main trading center for fruit companies throughout Central  Florida.

According to the Seminole Hotel Booklet, the Winter Park area was ideal for northern settlement since it was full of natural beauties such as \"crystal lakes\" and \"southern pines\".  To conserve the natural beauty of this community, the Town Improvement Association was established in 1887.","            Since its establishment in 1881, Winter Park has gone through many developmental changes in order to accommodate its growing population.

All of these advancements in Winter   Park lead to an economic boom which resulted in its incorporation as a town in 1887. In order to sustain the towns economic success, conservation organizations like the TIAWP were installed.","    A look at the TIAWP's constitution, one can see the conservation methods taken by community members to preserve the towns renown beauty. Article II of the Constitution states the object of the Association is to \"improve and ornament the streets and public grounds of Winter Park\".

Casson explained in his book, <em>Cyrus Hall McCormick: His Life and Work, </em>that the crowd included “several political leaders of local fame, farmers, professors, laborers, and a group of Negroes who frolicked and shouted in uncomprehending joy.” Undoubtedly, this demonstration would be one of the most important in American agricultural history, considering that the harvesting of grain was done by hand with scythes and sickles up until this point.","As McCormick made his way across John Ruff’s hilly field, the reaper appeared to be an utter failure as it jolted in various directions. Ruff shouted in protest, “Stop your horses. You are rattling the heads off my wheat!” The young farmer-inventor felt humiliated to have his machine proven faulty in front of this large group of bystanders.","Laborers celebrated McCormick’s failure, as his machine was their challenger in the labor market.

By 1838, Johnston was disliked by many of his neighbors because he was producing nearly six times the bushels of wheat per acre than they were.  But Johnston was not secretive about his methods and told people it was due to this tile drainage system. He emphasized the fact that the land in the Finger Lake region was flooded and in using tiles a farmer could drain excess water, thus increasing crop yield. People of the area did not believe him and just called his success luck.","Tile Drainage in American farming did not become a popular tool until 1848, when Robert Swan finally listened to John Johnston.  Robert Swan was a wealthy man who made his money in the city before moving to upstate New York.  He was John Johnston’s neighbor and the first man to be willing to give Johnston a chance.  In his diary, Robert Swan slowly unfolds his opinions of Johnston’s tile drainage system, a very influential farming tool, which individually revolutionized agriculture in upstate New York.  On August 10<sup>th</sup> 1848, Robert Swan wrote in his Memorandum. that Mr. John Johnston, “thinks tiles are the best method laid 2.5 feet deep in the ground; cost of tiles 28 cents, ditching 15 cents cost altogether 40 cents for rod.”  Displayed here, is a monumental moment in American agricultural production because immediately following this confrontation, Swan refitted his entire farm with Johnston’s tile drainage system.","Johnston and Swan farmed their land during a transitional time in American farming.  With the help of some influential neighbors and the president of the New York State Agricultural Society, many upstate farmers soon adopted Johnston’s tile system.  Among these influential neighbors were Ben F. Whartenby, the manufacturer, and John Delafield, president of the New York State Agricultural Society.  Delafield’s advocacy of the drainage system, especially in his lectures and speeches, helped integrate tile drainage into farming.  These four men remodeled upstate New York farming during the Market Revolution, helping transition self-sufficient family farming into commercially profit based businesses to."],"display_date":"1848 - 1852","search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":9090,"lat":42.7999140458,"lng":-76.8297839055,"zoom":9,"place":"SENECA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":564,"tag":"Market Revolution"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4992,"title":"DeWitt Clinton Explores Possible Canal Route","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1810-08-05","end_date":"1810-08-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1810 a group of government officials were sent out to explore and navigate a route for an artificial canal between Lake Erie and the Hudson River. Among the group commissioned to take this journey was DeWitt Clinton, who was the mayor of New York City for many years prior to this exploration. Along this journey Clinton kept a personal diary in which he documented all aspects of the land that surrounded him, whether it was noting how wide the rivers ran, to how many known birds are in the area he left nothing out. On August 5, 1810, DeWitt Clinton and his crew encountered the city of Buffalo, New York which at the time was better known as Buffalo Village.","Within the boundaries of Buffalo Village Clinton noted that there were thirty to forty houses that complimented several markets and taverns, a post office, and the Niagara County Court House. In other words this village had a decent population. Clinton said it best as he explained in his diary that Buffalo “is a place of great resort. All persons that travel to the Western states and Ohio, from the Eastern states and all that visit the falls of Niagara come this way.” Right away Clinton was able to conclude that this could be a very prosperous village. He observed that the surrounding stream was very deep and navigable for five miles, allowing for easy exploring. Another strong attraction of this village was that upstream was the Seneca Indian saw mill, which was impregnated with oil. Clinton also noted the variety of the fish that occupied this stream such as white, herrings, sheep-head, sturgeon and a variety of bass. Enough fish to provide an ample food supply for a dense population. All of these factors made the Village of Buffalo a good candidate for the canal to run through.","An important aspect of creating artificial water way was making sure that there was a current strong enough to pull boats and other forms of transportations. Clinton questioned Buffalo locals to gain this knowledge. According to Mr. Geddes, a native of the village, the current could range anywhere from six to seven miles an hour. This proved to be very important because the vessels that would transport goods and people along the canal weighed several tons. DeWitt Clinton’s vivid recollection of his exploration during 1810 proved to play a vital role in the construction of the Erie Canal. His personal diary indicated how well Buffalo’s surrounding economy would do after the creation of the canal as he incorporated how accessible natural resources were to those who passed through the area.","After Clinton’s explorations across New York, he and the commissioners were able to reach an agreement that the city of Buffalo would be included as a part of the Erie Canal. Sitting on Lake Erie, Buffalo provided a commercial bond between the east and the west, allowing travelers to enter from the Great Lakes. Upon the canals completion in 1825, Buffalo became a place that offered great prosperity as it quickly became enriched with economic and cultural prosperity that it had not seen before. With the rapid increase of commerce in the area due to the canal, Buffalo was essentially incorporated as a city in 1832."],"display_date":"August 5, 1810","search_date":"1810-08-05","locations":[{"id":8933,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NIAGRA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":563,"tag":"Erie Canal"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":602,"tag":"Transportation/Migration"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":5024,"title":"Agricultural Change in the Mid-Nineteenth Century","course_id":45,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-21","end_date":"1841-10-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Laban Morey Wheaton kept records of all his economic transactions while he lived in Norton, Massachusetts, in the mid-nineteenth century, and the year 1841 was no exception. Between July and October of this year, Wheaton made a number of transactions with a man, Sumner Blandin. Looking at the records reveals that Blandin came to Wheaton about once a week, usually to get cash instead of food or goods. Additionally, Blandin appeared in almost every other one of Wheaton’s transactions for these few months. However, after this time Blandin’s name disappeared from the record."," ","The nineteenth century was a time for technological and agricultural change. A shift in farming during this time emerged as a result of new technology, but also from a changing need. For instance, now farmers not only produced food for themselves, but they worked to produce a surplus to trade or sell. Sometimes farmers would have to hire extra laborers for a short time to help with this farming. Laban Morey Wheaton was a wealthier farmer than most, as he was also a trained lawyer, a businessman, and a strong presence in the community. As a landowner and dairy farmer, Wheaton needed help from his community to run his factories and farms. Hence, Wheaton’s accounts with Sumner Blandin may indicate that Blandin worked for Wheaton for a short amount of time. This could explain the disappearance of Blandin from Wheaton’s account books, as he was only needed for a short time. Furthermore, it can justify the many cash transactions that happened between the two, as Wheaton was probably paying Blandin for his services. Lastly, the frequency of transactions with Blandin could also result from his frequent work as a hired laborer. Therefore, looking at the account books of a man like Laban Morey Wheaton may be able to reveal the shift in farming during the mid-nineteenth century."," "],"display_date":"July 21, 1841 - October 15, 1841","search_date":"1841-09-02","locations":[{"id":6120,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":686,"tag":"Wheaton"},{"id":685,"tag":"accounting records"},{"id":684,"tag":"mid-nineteenth century"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Junior Colloquium: Historical Methods","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":45,"school_id":2}},{"id":5025,"title":"Potato Agriculture in the Mid-Nineteenth Century","course_id":45,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-05-20","end_date":"1840-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the New England foliage began to turn in October of 1840, Laban Morey Wheaton sold Linus Howard an astonishing twenty-five bushels of potatoes, and only a couple of short days later Linus returned for another five bushels of potatoes. What could possibly explain this surge in the demand for potatoes in Norton Massachusetts? Laban dealt with many transactions concerning potatoes as indicated within his daybook. During the spring planting season five individuals stopped by Laban’s store demanding varying amounts of potatoes. Similarly during the fall harvesting season his store received roughly the same demand for potatoes with the price per bushel remaining a consistent twenty-five cents. New England agriculture during the early to middle nineteenth century experienced a fluctuating climate. It was an ice age on a small scale that left farmers with dry summers and bitterly frozen winters. New England’s harsh weather during this time had a tremendous affect upon its society, agriculture, and human way of life.","My answer to the reader lies within the potato plant itself and how it functioned as one of the leading staple crops in New England during the nineteenth century along side corn and small grains. Keep in mind the chunk of history I am unearthing deals with potatoes within their context before the outbreak of the “Potato Blight” epidemic that took place in the year 1844. The cultivation of potatoes provided New England’s farmers with consistently successful crop yields during a time when many crops would fail due to the harsh weather. In comparison to other crops, potatoes could thrive in the cold weather and provided more calories per acre than any other crop. Potato farming was the ideal crop for New England farmers; they were cheap, allowed for rapid agricultural production, and were capable of feeding humans as well as livestock.","Laban’s frequent potato transactions within the town of Norton, Massachusetts at first appears suspicious due to the fact that Mr. Wheaton was not a farmer, but instead a cotton textile mill owner and entrepreneur. These facts draw a correlation between the sale of potatoes and cotton textile mills during this time in history. Potato farmers from Vermont tell a similar story: “Vermonters began selling their potatoes to the starch factories springing up throughout the region. Levi Bailey operated a small one in Reading, Vermont, which opened in 1831 and sold its processed potato starch to agents who conveyed it to the large textile mills in Lowell and Providence.” (Demeritt, 148) This quotation shows the use of starch created by potatoes in manufacturing textiles.

Borden seemed to be a loyal and favored worker, however, for he continued to be paid for his labor over the months. There are a number of possible reasons for his absence from the farm: he could have been ill, or sent home if there was no work to do, or taken the day off for family or personal issues. Either way, Joseph Borden was treated well by his employer due to his loyalty.","By the mid-1820’s, hired labor had replaced family labor on farms. This change occurred because farmers were expanding their production, both in the number of crops being harvested for market, and the increasing necessity to be self-sufficient on the homestead. Farmers needed more help than ever, and relying on a small number of family members for help wasn’t always an option, as most farmers’ children left town when they were able to.  As there were an increasing number of farm hands available, it was important for farmers to seek out hard working and faithful men to work on their land. There were many, cheaper workers that were lazy and uninterested in doing diligent work. So when a farmer found a loyal helper, it was beneficial to both people to develop an understanding relationship.

cowboys on their stallions relay in the chase after the stampede of wild mustangs.  For three full days, the cowboys pass off the shift of herding the animals until after hunger, thirst, and ceaseless movement, the stampede is forced into a state of complete exhaustion only to be captured by their faithful pursuers.   “Wild Horse Charlie” was the first to make a business on a larger scale of capturing mustangs by the implementation of this exhaustive method.  Starting in Colorado, Wild Horse Charlie would drive the mustangs as far as Nebraska and Iowa, where they would be sold as saddle driving ponies.  It was not uncommon to cover a hundred square miles of ground over the course of the capture. ","As early as the 1870s, cowboys were making a business of catching bands of mustangs to sell in the states to the east and to the north.  Another method of capture was to construct a large circular corral whose entrance led into a chute or passageway narrow enough to prevent escape.  The cowboys would surround the fleeing mustangs on all sides so that the only path was straight into the gates of the corral where they would find themselves hopelessly trapped.  The understandable fright of the horses led to frantic trampling in which many would be killed or maimed until they became a panting, foaming, breathless mass.  Lassoing them by their feet, the cowboys would place clogs on the front legs of the animals to prevent their running away until they grew accustomed of their new master. ","The most dangerous and often unyielding method of securing a mustang was “creasing.”  In this method, the cowboy would aim a rifle just so that it could graze the neck of the mustang enough to stun it and knock it down so that it could then be tied up.  Creasing was used only for the purpose of capturing individuals that stood apart for their beauty, color, swiftness, or other form of uniqueness.  As can be expected, the experiment too often went wrong.  Aiming the shot even just an inch off could lead to serious injury or the bullet could miss the animal entirely. ","The daily life of a westerner at the end of the nineteenth century was one of serious contrasts.  The cowboy was a player in the world economy providing sources of capital and markets for production, and yet cowboys lived and worked in areas isolated from the rest of the world where they lacked many of the refinements enjoyed by Americans of the East.  In this land of individual opportunity and personal advancement, the home was often a small place of basic shelter far less advanced than the farm machinery on which the westerners were so entirely dependent.  Large corporations and family-run businesses alike defined the work of the nineteenth-century cowboy, and ranches and farms represented the majority of the cowboys’ place of work.  In a market where household farms were dependent on family labor, most did not work for wages but were self-employed and required the help of the entire family, including women and children.  Though the rapid development of the West was seen as a great triumph, it is hard to measure the success of individuals in the West as opposed to the East.  Opening farms, cutting forests, and building cities were all part of the physical transformation of the West toward progress, but personal advancement and success was often the ultimate judgment of an individual cowboy.","Though often remembered today as lazy, good-for-nothing, drunkards, to be a cowboy was a serious endeavor.  Cook seeks to adamantly shake off this misinformed stereotype by recounting the tremendous difficulties faced by the hard-working cowboy.  A firm understanding of the habits of the mustang as well a commitment to the hard work it took to capture them highlight one laborious task of the Western cowboy.  As Americans travelled westward, the newly acquired asset gave them unlimited potential that was rich with minerals, resources, and fertile land.  Agriculture was the only true necessity for survival, but fertile land was inefficiently distributed as the US government gave up so much of it for the production of railroads that would have been more suitable for agriculture. "],"display_date":"1870 - 1879","search_date":"1874-12-31","locations":[{"id":8092,"lat":40.8888443038,"lng":-99.0588211933,"zoom":9,"place":"BUFFALO,

better than the biggest name in printing today to lead the expedition into map printing than Rand McNally? Starting in railroad guides, the company eventually worked its way into maps in 1872, using a new wax engraving method that allowed it to print maps at a greatly reduced cost. This ensured the company’s ability to expand its publishing productions into maps and geography textbooks; in 1895, Rand McNally published a map of South Carolina  detailing both major and minor cities, railways, businesses, and – the most enlightening of all of these – the locations of land owned by various families in the state. The map lists the various divisions of population, including a very clear distinction between natives and foreigners, as well as separations of race.","The fact that the map lists, among the minor cities, the different properties owned by families and businesses in the state is a sign of the era from which the publication comes. Only 30 years after the end of the Civil War, these people are still defined by their land and what they do. The importance of a person and the size of their land is shown by the size of their listing on the page; some families’ names are larger than others, while others nearly need a magnifying glass to be seen. However, these listings can give an insight into the post-Civil War South. The names crowd each other on the page, fighting to be seen; but without the labor to work them, what use are they? The population of blacks at this time greatly outnumbers whites – 688,934 blacks to 462,008 whites – but their emancipation means a living is harder to come by. Whites were reluctant to hire their former slaves for the prices these newly freed people believed they were worth, and that meant the land was not worked to its full extent.","The number of former slaves working as farmers and laborers is not listed, but it can be inferred that a great majority had to struggle to find work, despite the obvious need of white plantation owners for skilled workers. The Civil War may not have been a clash directly over slavery, but it is obvious that the end of the war crippled the South swiftly and severely.

At the beginning of 1849, San Francisco had a population of eight hundred. However, its population had reached twenty thousand by the increasing population of the gold seekers and immigrants after 1850.","People invented techniques such as hydraulic mining to quickly extract gold .

The miners assert that they can throw a stream four hundred feet into the air. ... Those streams directed upon an ordinary wooden building would speedily unroof and demolish it,\"  The new technique drained hundreds of gallons of water into the hills, and it helped miners quickly rend the hillside into a pile of gravel and provided plenty of pay dirt from which to separate gold.","However, surface gold was exhaustible, and gold did not renew itself quickly. There were miners by the tens of thousands combing every cranny of the foothills, probing the granite and gravels of the mountain streams. An article for the <em>Palo Alto Times</em> wrote that gold was produced but in insufficient quantities to make the industry profitable. In the development of economy, there was a conflict between farmer and miners about a right to destroy the valley lands. The hydraulic mining technique ruined fertile lands and caused fights between miners and farmers. In the process, miners devastated the landscape and choked the rivers with sediment. The sediment washed downstream and flooded farmlands, destroying crops. Finally, a court ruling brought an end to hydraulic mining in 1884, and agriculture took over as the principal force behind the California economy.","Miners invented a tool to gather more gold, and it continued the development of the economy during the gold rush. However, the hydraulic mining system required a lot of water from the rivers. As the washes dried out, miners dug ditches to water sources, rapidly extending them in pursuit of the constantly retreating stream.

Additionally, the climate proves to be beneficial in certain areas with minimal exposure to winter weather and ideal mild sunshine.  The people of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century acknowledged the optimum natural resources that California possessed.  The completion of the railroad in 1869 led to accessible transportation for Americans to the state.  They took advantage of the fertile land and prime weather in the Central Valley.","Prospective farmers could purchase an acre of land at $75, $100, or $150, depending on location, with a set eight percent interest rate. They had the choice of what they wanted to grow. Produce in the region included various fruits such as oranges, grapes, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, apples, nectarines, and assorted berries. Fruit trees sold for $100 to $350 per acre, and within five years, trees would bear maximum fruit, resulting in profit and the chance to pay off investments. Farmers also had the choice to raise various livestock, including cattle, pig, sheep, and chicken. Cattle and chicken were popular because farmers could further profit by incorporating dairy into their revenue while waiting for their fruit trees to reach maturity. In theory, if a prospective farmer planned to spend $10,000, in addition to the acreage, fruit trees, and livestock, he could purchase a house and barn, a well and pump, and expenditures associated with everyday living at the time. However, not everyone who entered the farming business during this time understood the several processes of fruit culture. Fortunately, they had the option to hire professionals educated in the field. These educators would demonstrate different methods including how to transform grapes into raisins, how to obtain prunes from plums, how to cultivate, and things of that nature.

F. Drinkwater advertised that “‘Kansas’ bottom lands are exceedingly rich, and bring large crops of corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, sugar cane and vegetables, as well as hemp and cotton. The successful raising of the latter is no longer an experiment here.” But he added one more fact to make his call pertinent. It became easy and comfortable to come to Kansas by train. Who could claim better at that time? He stated that “the Missouri Pacific railroad from St. Louis to Wyandotte is one of the best roads in the country, and this new Union Pacific, E. D., is as good a new road as is in use, if not better. Let me say parenthetically that when you come to Kansas of course you had better take the route by St. Louis and Wyandotte over the Missouri Pacific.”","The farmer settlers switched their goal from self-sustainability to commercial production. They had more than they really needed for themselves. People even figured out that growing wheat and oat crops might be as profitable as growing cotton, without generating the associative problems such as slavery issues and the severe effect of the Panic of 1819. After the Missouri controversy, agriculture was focused on other crops. “Rye and sugar cane are called sure crops in Kansas.” The horticulture profits were significant. Orchards started to appear everywhere in Kansas. In particular, vineyard and wine production became a flourishing business. But the exportation of these products to the Eastern and Northern part of the country would not be possible with wagons, which usually took several months to make the trip.","Railroads to connect Kansas to the East and to the West were a necessity;  otherwise, the new settlers would not be successful. The railroad was a faster and safer way to transport a product for sale. Because of the Panic of 1819 and the resulting financial crisis, railroad construction was stopped and compromised. Politicians did not lost their power due to the cotton crash; instead, it was the first settlers who had to directly apply for grants to Washington in order to resume the railroad construction. A second halt happened during the Civil War. The construction was costly because the materials such as iron rails and the technology used were imported from Europe. The situation was confused, but the nationalism of Americans saved the situation. The hope was born again because of the authorization given to the L. P. & W. via the Pacific Railway act of 1862 “to build from an eastern terminus below the junction of the Missouri and Kansas rivers to the designated starting point of the Union Pacific on the 100<sup>th</sup> meridian.” Drinkwater even promised the Congress “As I have before remarked, this trade will be utterly beyond calculation, particularly if our Congress will be so kind as to adjust our internal and external revenue laws, so that American tax paying manufacturers and farmers shall, at least, have an equal chance in our home market with our British rivals.”","D. F. Drinkwater requested himself that more funds be used for railroad construction than for cavalry troops that were to secure the lands against Indians and. He noticed that \"just as fast as the Pacific Railway passes the great military posts upon its line, these become unnecessary, and are, in effect, abandoned.” The reason was that “the Kansas Pacific Railway narrowed the field of operations against the Indians.”  Therefore, the federal government would save money by speeding the railroad construction. Investing in the railroad construction was a win-win decision. Indeed, it “pushed 'the plains' further and further west, and saved the Government the necessity and expense of permanent forts.”"],"display_date":"September 5, 1866","search_date":"1866-09-05","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":411,"tag":"Westward Expansion"},{"id":666,"tag":"Railroad"},{"id":1072,"tag":"Pacific Railway"},{"id":1073,"tag":"Union Pacific"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":75,"school_id":40}},{"id":5331,"title":"Thaddeus Hyatt Appeals to President Buchanan to Address the Kansas Territory’s Drought","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-02-04","end_date":"1861-01-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Discussion of the Kansas Territory before the Civil War often turns directly to the time period known as “Bleeding Kansas,” which generally refers to the year of 1856 or to its part in the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. These events, however, were not what the citizens of the Kansas Territory were concerned with immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War. In 1860, with the rest of the country absorbed in the presidential election, Kansas suffered through severe drought and famine, to which the Federal government failed to respond. The letters and reports of visiting New Yorker Thaddeus Hyatt to President James Buchanan, detailing the deplorable conditions in the Territory, went largely ignored.","Hyatt penned seventy pages of reports and pleas to Buchanan to send aid to the suffering people of Kansas. Perhaps the most moving of all of his appeals was the final one. He expressed his disgust with the press of the East. While in Kansas, Hyatt had mailed numerous letters to the <em>New York Tribune</em> describing the suffering of Kansas’s citizens, with the hope that, with the publication of the letters, people of the East would have “compassion on the perishing people of Kansas.”","Upon Hyatt’s return to New York he was shocked to learn that only one of this letters had been published. As he discussed in his letters to Buchanan, he was ill from the conditions he witnessed in Kansas, but was even more disturbed by the silence of the press. Hyatt emphasized to Buchanan that since the citizens of the United States refused to help their brethren, the responsibility was placed upon the Federal government. He did not specify what Buchanan should do, only that he should take some sort of action. Of all Hyatt’s statements, the most powerful was that he desired “speedy relief” to “reach a multitude of starving American citizens, even though <em>they cannot vote.</em>”","Here Hyatt revealed an even larger issue of the time. Despite the fact that Kansas had sufficient population to be admitted into the Union in 1860, it still remained a territory. If Kansas had been a state during the drought of 1860, it would have been able to receive “federal resources.” The only action that Buchanan took to aid Kansas was to make a personal donation of one hundred dollars.","The significance of this action, or lack of action, may have contributed to Kansas’s position at the outbreak of the war. The policy of the Buchanan administration towards the drought, despite such reports as Hyatt’s, paved the way for Republican and Constitutional Unionist criticism of the Democratic Party in the 1860 election. The critique by some was that the Democrats had failed Kansas, which increased Union sympathy in Kansas during the war."," "],"display_date":"February 4, 1860 - January 14, 1861","search_date":"1860-07-25","locations":[{"id":4294,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DONIPHAN, Kansas"},{"id":4224,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALLEN, Kansas"},{"id":4541,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"BRECKENRIDGE, Kansas"},{"id":4335,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"GREENWOOD, Kansas"},{"id":4254,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"CHASE, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1131,"tag":"Thaddeus Hyatt"},{"id":1130,"tag":"Kansas Territory"},{"id":1129,"tag":"James Buchanan"},{"id":1128,"tag":"Drought"},{"id":1127,"tag":"Famine"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5676,"title":"Nathaniel Hawthorne's departure from Brook Farm","course_id":99,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-10-01","end_date":"1842-10-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 17, 1842 Nathaniel Hawthorne officially resigned himself from Brook Farm, an attempt at a utopian society founded on the precepts of the early socialistic ideas of Charles Fourier. Having arrived there on April 12, 1841 Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member, both in person and purse, of the Brook Farm experiment, but the author spent only six months with the community (having physically departed in late October, 1841) and eventually filed a lawsuit against the founder of Brook Farm, Unitarian minister George Ripley, on September 6, 1845 for $585.70.","Brenda Wineapple suspects that Hawthorne was initially attracted to Brook Farm since Hawthorne was \"[i]n need of a home, an income, and a place to write, Hawthorne gladly gambled on Ripley's arcadia. The union of thinker and worker was irresistible to a man whose conscience still cared about idleness and still considered writing a frivolous pastime, no matter how much he wanted to do it\" (147). As such, the intentions of Hawthorne were fair enough, wishing to engage in small bits of manual labor in order to become closer to the transcendental, ideal state, and, of course, to write in his leisure time, which he anticipated as being great in quantity. These notions of Hawthornes couldn’t have been further from the outcome, though.","Hawthorne was not keen on the work nor lifestyle that Brook Farm demanded of its community. Brook Farm, being an agricultural community required a great deal of fertilizer, which, for Brook Farm, was manure--that is animal feces. Hawthorne’s designated job was to shovel piles and piles of this manure and transport them daily. The seemingly endless mounds of manure were disheartening to Hawthorne. He would confide to his fiancée in a letter that he \"never suspected that farming was so hard,\" and wished to be rescued from it \"before [his] soul is utterly buried in a dungheap.\"","Hawthorne also little time for writing. The hard labor, new surroundings, and level of social activity required as a member of a socialist community prevented him from beginning any literary projects larger than a personal letter or occasional journal entry. The social aspect of Brook Farm is what had the greatest effect on Hawthorne’s writing habits. James T Fields, a publisher with whom Hawthorne worked with, noted \"He was a man who had, so to speak, a physical affinity with solitude.\"","With the burden of work yoking Hawthorne, and without the time for writing’s recuperative effect, as well as being many miles away from his fiancée, Hawthorne was in a decidedly abject state while at Brook Farm. In fact, one of Hawthorne’s fellow associates of Brook Farm, Georgiana Kirby wrote of Hawthorne’s awkward state while a part the community:","\"Hawthorne, after spending a year at the Community, had now left. No one could have been more out of place than he in a mixed company.... He was morbidly shy and reserved, needing to be shielded from his fellows...\"","And so, eventually, the lifestyle of Brook Farm became too much to bear for Hawthorne. Upon his departure Hawthorne demanded his initial investment from founder George Ripley. They battled back and forth for several years after Hawthorne’s departure (since, unbeknownst to Hawthorne, Ripley nor Brook Farm had the money to pay him back) until Hawthorn eventually filed a lawsuit by the end of 1845. The outcome of this lawsuit or whether Hawthorne received back his initial investment is unknown.<br /><br />"],"display_date":"October 1, 1841 - October 17, 1842","search_date":"1842-04-09","locations":[{"id":6208,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":522,"tag":"Massachusetts"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1652,"tag":"Hawthorne"},{"id":1653,"tag":"Nathaniel"}],"course":{"name":"Pamphlets &amp; Pirates: Popular Print Culture in Antebellum America","school":"Northeastern University","course_id":99,"school_id":56}},{"id":5722,"title":"'V' is for Victory","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/45","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["One of the reasons for promoting Victory Gardens during World War Two was that they would pay for themselves and put money in the pockets of those that grew them.  In a clipping from <em>Metro Newspaper Service </em>in 1945, a picture depicts a girl standing next to a boy with a hoe discussing a bush with money for leaves with a subtitle that advertises “many a Victory Gardener” would have been able to call “all his crops “cash crops”.”  Adjacent to the picture are two females, obviously mother and daughter, watching their husband and father set up their garden because “nothing [was] more gratifying than” “a productive garden.”","Amy Bentley has observed that War World Two was ridden with slogans.

Racial discrimination persisted as economic opportunity began to crumble.  Yet, within a few years, the community transformed into having a primarily African-American population.  In the decades after his family’s move and neighborhood changes, Yakini remembers the slow decline in public services, ranging from mass transit to garbage collection to fire fighting.  Today, over 80 percent of Detroit’s population is African-American and the unemployment rate stands at about 15 percent.","Now, Yakini is the chairman of the Detroit Black Food Security Network and in charge of several urban farm and gardening projects.  He believes that Detroit may be revitalized through food production, since its food production capacity is so immense. The city is spread over 360 acres and contains an estimated 150,000 abandoned parcels, causing officials to believe that the farming could clean up blight and grow jobs.  With the emergence of a local food-processing industry, 4,700 jobs and $20 million in taxes could be created.  By 2050, 29 percent of Detroit’s landscape would be allocated to farming, something that has gained the attention of prosperous landowners and entrepreneurs.","Yakini sees these changes being brought about by the community, going beyond the economics of urban farming. He thinks that the most important aspect of public gardens and farming is that it will tie people together for the common good.  He states, “African-Americans in Detroit tend to have a sense of despair and helplessness that is a direct result of oppression. Producing even some of our own food restores a sense of power, a sense that we can shape our own destiny.”  The future of Detroit not only relies on community leaders like Yakini, but also on the history that has shaped its current state."],"display_date":1999,"search_date":"1999-07-02","locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2052,"tag":"Urban Farming"},{"id":1978,"tag":"Unemployment"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5989,"title":"Wartime Agricultural Movements and Women","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/19","end_date":"10/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The year 1919 marked the United States’s first year out of war since 1914. World War I had been won with the help of an ambitious and aggressive campaign on the home front to overcome wartime shortages through collective action: namely widespread reducing, re-using, and home-producing (such as home-grown produce and canned goods).  The nation had looked to its women to take a leading role in igniting the nationalism and sense of patriotic obligation these efforts required.  As a 1919 Detroit Free Press article pointed out, women had risen to the occasion impressively.  In agriculture and gardening specifically, women’s efforts drew national recognition.  The “Farmerettes” as they were called, even became a division in the United States employment service, a milestone for women's rights considering society's generally negative attitute towards women in the workforce. The article described gardening as a “healthy and wholesome” outlet for young women, and due to its usefulness and proven success the article predicted that gardening for nationwide produce distribution would likely continue in the future. War gardens and victory gardens had created an occupational opportunity for women, even though the article pointed out, “American minds revolt at the idea of women in the work field.” The maternal nurturing and nourishing ideologies tied to the movement (and women in general) made this occupation seem less threatening than other fields, but it served as a powerful tool for empowering women to think about their capacity to occupy other social spheres.","Wartime agricultural movements such as the war gardens and liberty gardens of the World War I era and Victory Gardens during World War II had an especially important impact on women. These movements created opportunity for women to do what they had not done before…work outside the homestead. War gardens and victory gardens challenged gender norms and started the whisperings of political and social change within a male-dominated society. Though recognized for their contributions, these occupations within gardening and agriculture were still considered by many to be akin to the home-making and family-feeding spheres women had always occupied. Yet for many young women, being a farmerette served as a tool of empowerment. The sense of community and the success of their collective action called them to consider how they might continue to shape their identities through these assimilation into different domains. Big cities such as Detroit, Chicago, and New York provided an excellent place where women could gather and exchange ideas and feel recognized for their work.  Suffrage and women’s labor rights movements had roots, in part, in the empowerment women gained from wartime gardening and agricultural movements."],"display_date":"October 1, 1919","search_date":"1919-10-01","locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1719,"tag":"Victory Gardens"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6024,"title":"Soybean and Weeds Sandwiches: George Washington Carver and Henry Ford at the Tuskegee Institute","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"7/22/42","end_date":"7/22/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 22nd 1942, George Washington Carver, an African American scientist, visited his friend and fellow innovator, Henry Ford, at the Ford Nutritional Laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan.

Having visited each other several times, Ford and Carver formed a deep friendship. One time, when Ford heard that Carver had fallen ill and was having trouble climbing the stairs, Ford sent Carver an elevator to be installed in his home.","Believing that war brought an opportunity for Americans to utilize natural resources in a new way, Carver introduced Ford and his researchers to many different new products and recipes that could be produced out of agriculture.

Carver’s other ideas included axel grease, wood stain, ice cream, and dandruff cures from peanuts, fertilizer from swamp muck, and roadways from cotton.","Ford was drawn to Carver’s ideas, especially one for a synthetic rubber, since they both believed that the American farm was at the core of industry. They had previously worked together to create “chemurgy,” a new branch of science that merged agriculture and industry. Both Carver and Ford had a passion for conservation and believed that farmers and industrial society played an important part in the society and should not be lost to industrialization. Though Carver had been born into slavery, had bought his freedom with an old racehorse, and had the uncommon privilege to able to educate himself, he and Ford championed education for those in the South, believing that green industry, education, and agriculture were a harmonious engine for democracy.

In his descriptions of the Michigan Territory, he includes references to the state of affairs in terms of the academics, agriculture, tourism, aesthetics, and health of the Territory itself.  He also reports on the relative health and sanitary conditions of the city of Detroit and its inhabitants, despite the \"state of agriculture in the Michigan territory [being] far from flourishing.\" Evans notes approvingly that \"In point of health too, this territory yields to no part of North America. There is no place in the world more healthy than the city of Detroit,\" he adds, specifically mentioning the lack of \"consumption\" (tuberculosis) in the area, a disease that was ravaging several eastern urban centers.","Evans' report stands in stark contrast to the current state of affairs. As it stands today, it can be argued that Detroit is one of the least-healthy areas in the United States, both from a medical and environmental point of view. Evans mentions the lack of prosperous agriculture in Detroit, which is a concern that is still voiced to this day. The soil in the city has been so greatly polluted by lead paint, leaded gasoline, and industrial effluents that it is difficult to grow crops without first cleaning the ground, an arduous and expensive task left to city-dwellers with enough passion and drive to do it.","In addition to the poor agricultural health of the city, the health of the environment of Detroit is also considered to be problematic. The environment in the city is often thought of as unclean and unsafe due to its industrial history, which has included a massive bulidup of air pollution, soil pollution, water pollution, landfill accruement, vacant lots, burned buildings, and a generally desolate atmosphere as seen by many. Due to these (and many other) factors, many of Detroit's citizens suffer from diseases, poor nutrition, and unhealthy lifestyles that are difficult to cure without major city-wide changes. Despite the desolate outlook, there are many programs available to the people of Detroit that may take them back to being the healthiest people in America, as once touted by Evans. These programs include small-scale greenhouses, health and wellness centers (as available through programs like the Department of Health and Wellness Promotion), and the Fair Food Network, which provides Detroit inhabitants with access to healthy food and education on nutrition and healthy habits.

Glidden of De Kalb, Illinois.  Glidden invented “a new and valuable improvement in wire fences,” with the goal to “preserve cattle from breaking through wire fences…the fence wire is composed of two strands which are designed to be twisted together after the spur.”  The United States Patent Office issued a total of nine patents for wire fence improvements in the five years leading up to and including Glidden’s.  Michael Kelly was issued the first patent in November, 1868. Glidden’s barbed wire, however, proved to be the most popular and most effective.  According to historian James Roark, the invention of barbed wire changed America’s west by “revolution[izing] the cattle business and sounded the death knell for the open range.”","Before barbed wire, if ranchers wanted a fence for their livestock they made it out of wood which was expensive because it was scarce in some parts of the west and had to be shipped in from the east.  Wire fences before barbed wire consisted of a single strand of wire that could easily be broken by cattle.  Without fencing to keep cattle in, the bovines grazed freely competing for grass and water and destroying crops like wheat.  Every year, cattle owners led their herds to slaughter houses unhindered by wire fencing.  Barbed wire limited the open range and in turn limited the freedom of ranchers and cowboys.","Barbed wire had a major impact on the many settlers and nomadic Native Americans living in the west.   Previously, the land was open for public use with many ranchers’ cattle roaming freely, eating, and drinking.  Now, ranchers and settlers fenced off their land with many believing they were being cut off from necessities. This started many disputes, and eventually led to a concentration of power in the hands of the land owners. The wealthy ranchers started fencing their land and individuals with livestock but no land had nowhere for their livestock because much of the public land was becoming too overgrazed.  For the small-time ranchers, many had to sell out to large ranches, and then many had become wage workers for the large ranches.  Nomadic Native Americans used to roam freely, but now these barbed wire fences began to limit their movements.  Some even began calling barbed wire the “Devil’s Rope.”","The invention of barbed wire changed the west permanently by limiting the open range and starting many fights over land.  Glidden did not invent barbed wire, but simply made the best improvement of Kelly’s first design.  Besides having the most effective barbed wire by locking the barbs into place with a double strand of wire, Glidden also invented the machine that mass-produced his barbed wire.  Glidden’s patent was challenged in 1892, and in 1895 he won his case and can be considered the Father of Barbed Wire."],"display_date":"November 24, 1874","search_date":"1874-11-24","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":118,"tag":"invention"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2468,"tag":"American West"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6292,"title":"Women Working on the Homefront during WWII","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/43","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When the men of America were called upon to serve their country during WWII, many job positions and duties on the Homefront were left unfulfilled.

Advertisers and propaganda agencies created fictional characters such as Rosie the Riveter to inspire women.

During the course of the war, the Women’s Land Army had recruited over 1.5 million women to join the homefront efforts. Jean Wanamaker of Bel Air, Maryland, was one of the recruits. She was participated in the first nationally offered college course on farming for women, offered at the University of Maryland. The course was created to make sure that Women’s Land Army workers were appropriately trained before engaging in farm work.

His goal: “arresting the further progress of the pest” that had ravaged the South’s vital cash crop, cotton. This “evil” was the boll weevil, and it was advancing from Mexico into the United States. To Brittin and his companions in the Odd Fellows Hall of New Orleans, this was as much a war as the Civil War had been, thirty-eight years earlier. “Production,” he said, “is not keeping pace with consumption, and if this condition be not relieved, some other section of the world will produce the cotton needed.” The Honorable Charles Schuler agreed that Louisiana must be protected from the boll weevil as Texas had not been. He questioned how “veterans who had sacrificed their property and their lives to the back the human vermin that infested their State would suffer this insect to overwhelm them.” The “immense importance of the crop” and the necessity of protecting it was proven by the sheer number of people who depended on it for their livelihood. Scientists like Professor H. A. Morgan knew that the weevils fed “upon volunteer or planted cotton” and advised that “infected” fields “should immediately be quarantined.\"","Despite the intensity of this call to war, the boll weevil slowed the production of cotton in the south. Poor tenant farmers suffered as much as, if not more than, rich plantation owners. All was not lost, however. Cotton had become king in the south, and this had resulted in irresponsible growing practices; the boll weevil invasion forced cotton growers to rethink their methods. Growers began to us more fertilizer on their plants, increasing the time that a plot of land could be used before it was depleted of nutrients. Even more drastically, the boll weevils’ presence slowed cotton production until it could no longer support the southern economy singlehandedly. The monocropping culture gave way to a more diverse agriculture. Eventually, southerners began to recognize that the boll weevil had not ruined their lives.
