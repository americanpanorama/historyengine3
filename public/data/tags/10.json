By 1850, the Louisa Railroad was built east to Richmond and west to Charlottesville. As the railway extended, it was renamed the Virginia Central Railroad. Desiring to move forward with internal improvements, the Commonwealth of Virginia allotted money to continue to expand the line. Moving westward, the Virginia Central moved through Gordonsville, past Staunton, and towards Covington. To finish the line across the mountainous territory of the Alleghany Plateau, the Commonwealth chartered a state-subsidized railroad called the Covington and Ohio Railroad. However, by this time, the Civil War would break out, and the westward expansion of the railway stopped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Civil War, the Virginia Central Railroad was one of the Confederacy's most important lines, carrying food, troops, and supplies constantly. By war's end, though, the line would be torn apart and wrecked completely. In order to rebuild the railway, funds had to be sought outside of the economically devastated South. Through a chief New York entrepreneur, Collis P. Huntington, Virginians were supplied with the money to complete the railway to the Ohio River as the Covington and Ohio and the Virginia Central Railways were already previously consolidated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the completion of this railway, many perceived the line as the great route establishing a significant connection between the tidewater of Virginia and the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Virginia was now in a quick and direct union with rich coalfields and wealthy mineral deposits of the Ohio River valleys. Thus, this railway was vastly productive for Virginia and the South in general. Furthermore, this achievement benefited many of the Western states, whose huge shipments had grown to such magnitude that existing railroads were scarcely able to accommodate the teeming freights."],"display_date":"January 29, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-29","locations":[{"id":13918,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":168,"title":"African-Americans Try to Improve the Status of Their Race\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1863, black communities began to hold large meetings to discuss the articulation and communication of new attitudes towards African-Americans.  One such meeting was held in a black Baptist church in Memphis to commemorate the first anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.  This meeting was one of the first of black convocations that called for social reforms among the black community and improvement of their status through emancipation, military service, and education.'  In addition, at this meeting, African-American men in all places, at all times and under all circumstances' were encouraged to stop using the vulgar phrase, nigger,'' because it had become common practice for military officers to address black soldiers as such (Journal, 186).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that African-Americans did attempt to improve the status of their race, the officers did not always respond favorably to these attempts.  For example, on February 2, 1864, a Georgia newspaper printed an article saying that there had been a situation in Mississippi where the officer of an African-American company harshly admonished one of his men for carelessness during shooting practice.  The soldier said that he would not stand such language,' especially considering the how respectable the officer was.  The officer responded by hitting the soldier over the head with his gun, which instantly killed him.  The black soldiers then flew to arms' and wounded or killed over one hundred whites.

Cameron owned several large mills in Roanoke Rapids and Weldon, Virginia.

However, even by the end of the nineteenth century, electric power was a relatively new technology and was considered a luxury rather than a necessity. Where electricity was appearing, it was controlled by privately owned, un-regularized companies that could charge whatever price they wanted for their services.

The canal and rail connections found in Augusta made it ideal for wartime industry like the production of gun powder.  In fact the canal attracted such a broad array of war time industries during the Civil War that the citizens of Augusta began to think of the city as the heart of the Confederacy.  Without the canal system and factories built along it prior to the War, the role Augusta played in the fighting of the Civil War would have been lessened.&lt;br /&gt;In arguing for the extension of the canal and railroad system, proponents stated that improved levels of transportation would benefit the state as a whole.  These same supporters also claimed that the increased availability of railroads and canals would enable Georgia to grow and export more cotton to other regions and abroad.  This effect would occur because much of the land of Georgia did not have easy access to natural waterways for easy exportation of crops, especially cotton.  Proponents of this expansion claimed that the revenues spent on the construction of these means of transportation would be more than recouped by increased revenues from cotton."],"display_date":"January 1, 1847 - January 30, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-15","locations":[{"id":2189,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":267,"title":"Mayor of Macon advises of disease risks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-05-24","end_date":"1847-05-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The mayor of Macon, Georgia issued a health warning at the suggestion of the Board of Health about the dangers of stagnant water.  The proclamation details the danger of leaving water to lay stagnant on one's property because of the risk of mosquito born diseases like yellow Fever and malaria.  The mayor states that the city has gone to considerable expense to remove stagnant water from public lands, but in order to more adequately protect the city from the risk of disease, private land owners must take responsibility for clearing the water off of their lands.  For the white population of the town to remain healthy during the warm, humid summer months, citizens must aid the government in keeping the mosquitoes that carry yellow fever and malaria at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically the warning neglects to mention the necessity of keeping the areas inhabited by slaves free from mosquitoes.  This absence of concern probably comes from the widely accepted belief that blacks possessed immunity to both the common mosquito born diseases of the era.  The white population also believed that mosquitoes only bit during the night, thus day time contact with black people did not pose a threat, and since the two races slept in completely different areas nighttime contact with the stagnate waters in slave areas did not pose a threat to masters and their families.  African-Americans possessed a degree of immunity from childhood encounters with the disease, but they still became mildly ill when exposed to the disease later in life.  The belief that slaves possessed immunity to yellow fever and malaria probably helped support the view of African-Americans as lazy.  Since the whites did not believe that the blacks were ill, the whites attributed the actions of their slaves to laziness rather than illness."],"display_date":"May 24, 1847","search_date":"1847-05-24","locations":[{"id":2028,"lat":32.4034959139,"lng":-84.0903375418,"zoom":10,"place":"MACON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":273,"title":"Immigration Societies in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-01-30","end_date":"1874-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 30, 1874, Charleston's News and Courier featured an article concerning the recent phenomenon in the state of so-called immigration societies.  Before the Second Taxpayer's Convention attempted to bring in immigrants on a state-wide level in South Carolina, there were several counties that had immigration societies (See Second Taxpayer's Convention in Columbia, SC) including  Fairfield, Barnwell, Kershaw, Chester, Anderson, Oconee counties.  The immigrants paid their passage from New York to South Carolina or paid a fee and in return received some land in an immigration society.  &lt;br /&gt;The article in the News and Courier describes one reporter's encounter with an immigration society organization in New York called the Palmetto State Immigration Agency.  Many immigrants in that city had responded to flyers promising to provide them with employment in South Carolina.  The agency would only take men who were married and preferably had children.  There was also a preference for immigrants from Germany, England, Ireland, Scotland, and Switzerland.  The immigrants would pay a fee for each family member for traveling expenses from New York to South Carolina.  The reporter, however, seemed wary of the idea that the immigrants would be mortgaging their labor' or paying off their debt to the agency by work once they arrived.  &lt;br /&gt;These communities in South Carolina were an attempt to import white immigrant voters in order to get the democrats back in power in South Carolina.  However, there were appealing economic reasons as well.

North Carolina has been dubbed Tobacco Land' because of the defining industry in the state of the manufacture of tobacco.  On October 19, 1874 Richard J. Reynolds purchased a 300 ft lot of property in Winston-Salem, NC and established the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company where he began to manufacture tobacco.  Other companies soon followed suit building other tobacco manufacturing factories in Winston-Salem and Durham.  R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. also gained prominence with its patent of a process to refine' tobacco in 1907.  An advertisement from that year claims that their refining process makes their tobacco the most delightful and harmless tobacco for cigarette and pipe smokers.' To this day the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is the 4th largest tobacco manufacturer in the world and the 2nd largest firm in the United States.  &lt;br /&gt;Reynolds was a very influential factor in Winston-Salem History; he served as city commissioner in 1884.  There are buildings and statues that memorialize him in Winston-Salem today.  By 1880 the tobacco industry in North Carolina was firmly grounded in the national market, and industry in that state exceeded what it was before the Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;The tobacco industry was booming in Virginia as well as North Carolina.  The tobacco industry allowed tobacco warehouses as well as tobacco manufacturers to prosper.

The boom in railroad reconstruction in the South coupled with successful westward expansion projects such as the Union Pacific Railroad had caused investors and speculators to bet heavily on new transportation projects (like a second transcontinental railroad, the Northern Pacific).  Once Cooke realized his firm had overextended itself financially in rail investments and was unable to meet its debt obligations (loans), he had to declare bankruptcy.  Fearing more defaults, banks around the country began calling in loans, causing more firms and investors to default, cutting off the rail industry's cash flow, causing more banks to call in more loans, and so on to cause a major financial depression; the New York Stock Exchange was closed for 10 days.  Between 1873 and 1879, employment reached a high of 14%, 89 of the nation's 364 railroads went under, and 18,000 businesses failed.  &lt;br /&gt;The aftershocks of the financial crash were soon felt in the Deep South, despite initially hopeful reporting that the worst has been seen;In Petersburg, Virginia several banks have been suspended; But off in the South and West no trouble is apprehended save some monetary stringency for a while' (Atlanta Constitution September 25).  The diary of a Northern Pacific Railroad employee named Thomas Rosser reveals the profound and rapid downward spiral Cooke's default initiated.  On September 18, 1873, Rosser learned; that Jay Cooke & Co. had failed. and [sic] the future of our co. is dark and uncertain.'  By October 13, less than one month later, the railroad had to send Rosser to Fargo in the Dakota Territories to represent the company at an auction sale to liquidate the last of the Northern Pacific's quartermaster dept. [property].'  In Rosser's words, the Northern Pacific [was] uttering its last gasp.'  The Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad soon joined the Northern Pacific in bankruptcy; by mid-November it was in the hands of receivers appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States, sitting at Mobile' (Montgomery Daily Advertiser).&lt;br /&gt;In this context of financial failure, Southern whites found it easy to blame Republican politicians in Washington and in their state governments, which in many cases had promised state funds to rebuild war-ravaged railways throughout the region (over 10 million alone to three North Carolina railroads).  The repercussions of the Panic reached across the South, as financial malcontent coupled with Republican corruption, lingering Civil War hostilities, and racial polarization lead to the North's retreat from Radical Reconstruction, making way for the Bourbon Redemption in 1876.  The South's large and influential agricultural sector took an especially large hit in the months following Northern investment failures, hurting black and white alike.  Crop prices dropped sharply: in just six short months, cotton prices fell by 50%, from around 20 cents per pound in July 1873 to just 10 cents per pound by December (prices quoted in the Atlanta Constitution). The double-whammy of a precipitous decline in profitability and steady deflation caused by a shortage of gold with which to back currency (the U.S. was still on the gold standard at the time) meant that farmers' debts were becoming more expensive at the same time that their crops were bringing in less money to pay those debts.  Property sales and bankruptcies were common, leading farmers to unite their collective woes and demand government aid, touching off the rapid expansion of the Grange Movement and the entrenchment of sharecropping."],"display_date":"September 25, 1873 - December 31, 1879","search_date":"1876-11-11","locations":[{"id":14181,"lat":37.1906306855,"lng":-77.2352563232,"zoom":10,"place":"Prince Georges, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":353,"title":"Labor Strikes in the Upper South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-11-05","end_date":"1877-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the mid- and late-nineteenth century, railroads and supporting businesses like iron and steel rolling were the nation's largest industrial employers. When the Panic of 1873 began causing financial problems for railroads, many had to cut wages and lower their orders from iron, steel, and cement suppliers; others, like the Northern Pacific, went bankrupt and ceased production immediately.  Subsidiary industries, in turn, were forced to cut their own employees' wages and hours or shut down.  In the face of cuts on all sides, workers began to use their only real defense: strikes.&lt;br /&gt;The Upper South was a hotbed of rail-building activity after the Civil War because so much of the fighting and, consequently, the destruction, had taken place in border states.  Additionally, parts of the Upper South were less agrarian than areas like the Black Belt and Carolina low country, making states like Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee more likely to turn to industrial employment.  These factors taken in conjunction with the Panic of 1873 produced a number of labor-relations problems.  In Louisville, the steel-rolling and iron-molding mills were forced to close as workers protested recent wage reductions and shift cuts, putting over 400 men out of work at the rolling mill alone.  The cement mills also had to shut down as a result of having large stocks and light sales,' the classic marks of a recession.  Just to the south, southern railroad company leaders met in Chattanooga to form a united front and face down aggressive strike tactics by workers, while also affirming the justice of any reasonable reduction of wages by companies.'  In Knoxville, the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad attempted to deal with striking employees who insisted on riding trains to prevent scabs from doing their jobs, while the Knoxville and Ohio line was forced to temporarily [cease] all trains,' the result of a total strike by its workers.  &lt;br /&gt;Railroad companies' financial difficulties caused by the Panic got much worse before they got better.  Consequently, the labor situation for subsidiary industries and rail workers kept deteriorating.  The freefall hit bottom in a wave of strikes in 1877, after which the economy and rail industries began their slow recovery.  The Panic affected all parts of Southern society, not just cotton farmers and political leaders, causing widespread malcontent which in the case of Tennessee and Kentucky, manifested itself through strikes and aggressive negotiations with the business elite.  The power of unions to halt production and at least have their demands heard by business leaders was not lost on employees at the time, setting the stage for the age of the union in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."],"display_date":"November 5, 1873 - December 31, 1877","search_date":"1875-12-03","locations":[{"id":12157,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":358,"title":"Maggie L.

This occurrence evidences the swift exchange of information allowed by having newspapers across the nation. Lastly, this large amount of newspapers was not only due to the growing desire of the populace to be informed, but this abundance of papers was spawned from the advent of the rise of the Jacksonian-Democrats, and the great divisions caused by this whole hearted use of the two party system. Relatively small cities such as Macon, Georgia and Lynchburg, Virginia had at least two papers in 1829 If later trends are to be believed, most likely one party ran one paper, while another party ran the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newspapers were constantly quoting other newspapers during this time period and editors were very interested to hear what other editors were writing.

The board found it unnecessary to continue the station at Vicksburg, considering its close proximity to the efficiently operating station in New Orleans.

Immediately prior to the Civil War, the number of cases decreased, and malaria was considered to be on the decline.  The war, however, introduced a new legacy of poverty, and health problems abounded, particularly in the South, where the region's health was severely weakened.  The number of malaria cases increased rapidly.  According to the Encyclopedia of the South, malaria became the leading cause of debility and loss of efficiency in the antebellum South.'  Malaria struck people all over the South, but tenant farmers, already poor and debilitated, were especially hurt by the epidemic.

Most of the mortalities occurred among the immigrant community who likely had no access to proper drinking water.  Cholera also struck New Orleans poor, free blacks, who lived in filthy and cramped rooms. &lt;br /&gt;Not much was known about either yellow fever or cholera in 1853.  In fact, physicians believed that cholera was transported through the air simply because victims of cholera claimed that they had trouble breathing.  This false belief was carried out to the extreme.  No one was willing to nurse the victims of cholera back to health for fear of catching the airborne' disease.  Therefore, many victims died alone in their homes.  Fearful citizens would burn tar in the streets to create a thick smoke which they believed might help eradicate the infection from the air.  Stray animals were also believed to be vectors of infection, and people would let the dead bodies of the animals decompose in the street instead of removing the bodies for fear of contracting cholera.  &lt;br /&gt; One interesting remedy' for cholera was alcohol consumption.  This was particularly interesting in a time when the subject of temperance was so hotly debated.  Women and even children would imbibe spirits because it was believed that it would cure cholera.  The tragedy was that cholera was spread through drinking- not drinking alcohol, but drinking water.  Cholera traveled in rivers and into public drinking water.

Physicians did not know if it was infectious, yet instead of quarantining the afflicted (the best thing to do in the nineteenth century), physicians did nothing.  In 1853, New Orleans was a city rife with squalor, yet nothing was done to improve sanitation.  As a result of the limited capabilities of medical science at the time and inaction on the part of city officials, yellow fever claimed thousands of lives.  Although 1853 was the worst year of the disease, it was not until the early twentieth century, when the Aedes aegypti mosquito was discovered to be the vector of the disease and the administration of quinine was better regulated, that the death toll began to decrease with any significance.&lt;br /&gt;Southerners of the time knew that Yellow Fever epidemics were not unique to 1853.  They complained about epidemics breaking out almost every year beginning with 1852.  1853 was the year that received such recognition because it was the year when more perished than ever before.  Nevertheless, nearly 13,000 people died of yellow fever in New Orleans between the years of 1822 and 1849.

Many problems plagued the public school system at the time, including necessary funding and the inclusion of African-Americans into the system. &lt;br /&gt;The state did not have enough money to fund the school system in 1871. In order to get funding, the state issued three modes of taxation for public schools that required schools to be partially funded by a county tax. County school districts were not eligible to receive state money if the county did not provide some of the funding. In Henrico County, not one African-American cast a vote, for or against, the local school tax when it was put to a vote because most of the African-Americans in Henrico were not property owners. The white voters determined the local tax would be initiated in Henrico County and as a result the white voters essentially allocated all of the tax revenue to the white schools. &lt;br /&gt;The state also had to determine how it would allocate its teachers. The Richmond Board of Education session of 1871-1872 needed to decide on how to allocate its teachers. It needed twelve teachers for white schools and fifteen teachers for Negro schools. The teachers with the highest scores on the teacher examination were sent to the white schools and the teachers with the lowest scores were sent to the Negro schools. During this time period it seemed improbable that a competent teacher would end up teaching at a Negro school.

On a larger scale, the creation of the Mississippi river commission sought to create a national policy for promotion of commerce.  On October 16, 1879 in Quincy, Illinois, the commission discussed their numerous recommendations to the federal government.  Their recommendations included the creation of a reservoir system in the upper Mississippi valley, and a prohibition on construction of wharves and water mills by private businesses and local communities designed to curb the formation debris and sandbars along the river.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, these improvements constituted only one part of the massive projects being envisioned by advocates of government infrastructure investment.

Although the causes of the outbreak were uncertain at the time, many people pointed out that the spread of the fever was aided by the lack of adequate sewage system in the city of Memphis. The outbreak of 1879 came on the heels of the yellow fever outbreak of 1878 in which almost 90% of Memphis's 20,000 residents became infected, and fully one quarter died.  The city of Memphis was threatened with extinction as commerce came to a halt under the tight quarantine imposed upon the city, hundreds of citizens fled the city and appearing in The Courier-Journal of Louisville declared Let Memphis be Burned.' Despite the grave threat posed by the yellow fever, with the end of the outbreak in October, commerce resumed and the city continued its rise to one of the commercial major hubs of the Mississippi river.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the outbreak had immense consequences for Memphis it also had a significant impact on the national level.

Because death rates were substantially higher for whites than for blacks (the mortality rate was under 7% for blacks and over 70% for whites in the Memphis outbreak of 1878) African-Americans became easy scapegoats for the outbreak.

In 1832, Morse began his travels back to America to the job of Professor of Painting and Sculpture at the University of New York. It was on his trip home that he overheard a shipboard discussion on electromagnets.

On May 24th, 1844 Morse sent the first electrical telegram from the Supreme Court Room in the Capitol to the railway depot at Baltimore. Transmitting over long distances with weak wires, these telegrams were signaled though the Morse code alphabet of long and short beeps. The message said, What hath God wrought?', words chosen by Annie Ellsworth.&lt;br /&gt;This new invention expedited the process of communicating within and between states. Although electrical telegrams were not used among common folk, government officials could put it to great use. Through this electronic method of communication warnings, alerts and criminal investigations could be dispatched across the country in far less time. This increased the chances of catching criminals and for a lot of people escaped slaves.

Soon, with the implementation of newer materials, lighter resources and fresher ideas, boats become better and faster then before. Access to a body of water was so necessary to means of living in the 18th Century that the upper class would buy isolated houses on the water front. As long as they had access to water they did not need neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;Soon thereafter railways and trains were built and a new industrialized form of trade emerged into the South. Railroads soon became another medium of trade, though not as reliable or as fast as one would have liked. The greatness of employing trains, however, meant that resources and commodities could be found and transported to places within the states that were not on or near a body of water. In 1844, iron was implemented for both railroads and underground railroads. Southern States that bordered water, had previously relied on steam boats and water for essential transportation needs. Now, they had a fast and reliable alternate form of transport. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads provided for more unity within the states, whereby people could travel across the country for leisure. It also provided an accessible method for transporting goods and commodities for trade, such as bringing sugar from the south up to the north, which boosted the economy. This improvement also enhanced the infrastructure of America. More importantly though, the railroads were now an easier way for slaves to escape their masters and oppressed lifestyles. Blacks knew that if they made it to the North or Canada, help awaited them. Underground railroads began to flourish all over the country.

The General Assembly set the grounds for the divorce, requiring that the courts determine whether or not Hezekiah had been a faithful husband, as well as whether Betsy had really committed adultery.  This is an example of someone's marriage situation, while also showing that divorce did not seem uncommon if there was a sufficient reason, such as an unfaithful spouse.  &lt;br /&gt;Another example occurred in January of 1815, where a white married woman named Mary Godsey eloped with William Arthur, another white man.

Secondly, with Robert's divorce petition, he had the support of respectable farmers and slaveholders.

The stagnate water and lack of trees in the city, he said, my indeed lead to the fever.  He ended with a recommendation to clean the city of the filth where such mists, humidity and exhalations arise.&lt;br /&gt;The disease persisted in America throughout the 19th Century.  Not until the early 1900's was the modern scientific method applied to research on Yellow fever and malaria.  The discovery of germs and their affects on humans and disease was a breakthrough.  Stemming for Pasteur's research with canning and preservation, a doctor named Jesse Lazaer working for the army discovered the disease was carried by mosquitoes.  His discovery was made by being bitten himself while in Panama.  He died 11 days after the bite, but his death ended the mist and exhalation theories dominating the yellow fever research for more than a century."],"display_date":"October 18, 1839","search_date":"1839-10-18","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1345,"title":"Riverside Cotton Mills and the Water Power Company\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-06-10","end_date":"1882-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Danville was only one of the many places that experienced the development of a newly mechanized and more highly capitalized cotton-processing business. As mentioned in the Promise of the New South, a prominent mill owner recalled that every city and town and village wanted a cotton mill.' Furthermore, towns took pride in their new water works, which first were established in major cities in the 1870s, spread to the larger places in the 1880s, and by the 1890s, every smaller city and town added these water works if they had the means to do so. Textile mills could be built wherever there was enough power to run to the machinery, and the Piedmont region offered an influx of rivers and streams with adequate flow of water. Ayers states that these up-to-date textile mills inspired much of the south's boosterism.' &lt;br /&gt;On June 10, 1882, Thomas Fitzgerald, Dr. H.W. Cole, Benjamin Jefferson, Robert Schoolfield, John Schoolfield, and James Schoolfield instructed the company's first counsel, R.W. Peatross, to draw up a contract binding them to incorporate as the Riverside Cotton Mills. Danville chartered the company on July 27, 1882 for the purpose of purchasing the necessary property, machinery and appliances, and constructing the necessary buildings for conducting and carrying on the business of manufacturing cotton and woolen fabrics, rope, [and] four at Danville, Virginia.' &lt;br /&gt;At the same time, the Water Power Company carried on the work of widening the canal by the river. By July 15, 1882, as explained in the State, the Morotock Manufacturing Company and other parties made a contract for the construction of a dam across the river just above the Union-street Bridge.' The Company intended to do this by repairing and enlarging the old canal. The capacity of the water-power was to be around 7,000 horse-power, and as a result there would be 3,500 horse-power on both sides of the river. On August 30, 1882, a crowd gathered to see the head gates opened to allow ten feet of water to flow into the forty-foot canal. Local press observed that the water power was sufficient and would be able to run all the factories on the canal. This would then hopefully provide Danville with its long-desired' prosperity and happiness of a first-class southern manufacturing center.' Furthermore, in late September, the State noted the improvements at Danville, specifically the cotton factories and machinery, could be enumerated at around 25,000, including the costs of the improvement of water power."],"display_date":"June 10, 1882 - August 30, 1882","search_date":"1882-07-20","locations":[{"id":14155,"lat":36.8111162856,"lng":-79.3976134371,"zoom":9,"place":"PITTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1358,"title":"Northwestern region of Virginia breaks away from the state\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-01","end_date":"1861-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Although Virginia decided to secede from the Union, the northwestern counties of the Allegheny region had different beliefs about the state's actions.  Three out of every four voters were against the secession.  As tensions mounted with the parent state, northern counties formed their own state and broke away from Virginia, allowing them to remain loyal to the Union.  The issue of the discontentment among Virginians arose in the state convention.  The secession of Western Virginia from Eastern Virginia in the event of the secession of the latter from the United States is openly evident in the State Convention at Richmond.

Richmond's appeal as a cultural and historical center of the south attracted a larger crowd.  The event was promoted as the best convention of the great and growing Christian brotherhood'.   The convention held sessions in the Auditorium building with a maximum capacity of 12,500 persons.  Hotels were accommodating visitors at rates as low as 1.00 per day and railroad companies sold roundtrip tickets at a flat rate across the country.  The bulletin boasted of a Christian welcome' awaiting all young Baptists.  The aim of the convention was to congregate Baptists from various rural areas around the nation and demonstrate their power in numbers to inspire young people with lessons from ideological leaders.  The theme of the convention was Discipleship'.  &lt;br /&gt;Virginia's importance in Baptist history and its large Baptist community made it an appropriate venue.  Richmond mayor, Richard M.

Designed mostly to make the Tennessee River passable to shipping, this appropriation was a tremendous endeavor for a state which had existed for only thirty-five years and was still very much an undeveloped and sparsely settled frontier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the government of Tennessee was beginning to recognize the importance of developing an efficient and usable infrastructure network not only to improve trade and the flow of goods, but also to improve communication. By clearing the Tennessee River and building roads and canals in other parts of the state, Tennessee not only improved its internal trade and communication, but it also more firmly link itself to the Mississippi River network. This network was an integral part of the U.S. economy as it stretched from New Orleans up through the frontier to the Ohio River Valley, the Northwest, and even the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence River, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean. By linking themselves to this network, Tennessee ensured not only an increase in the flow of goods and information, but a strengthening of bonds with the United States as a whole. Indeed, the Raleigh Register takes note of this Act on January 28, 1830, declaring it of very considerable importance, inasmuch as it will give an impulse to public enterprise.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This developmental sentiment was representative of the U.S. as a whole as well. In Virginia, for example, a letter from residents of Staunton to the General Assembly desired to incorporate(e) a Company, with the usual powers of a Turnpike Company' to construct a road from Staunton to intersect the Ohio and Chesapeake Canal.' However, acts such as that in Tennessee were overshadowed by a national debate on the proper role of the Federal government in development. Specifically, President Andrew Jackson contended that the Federal government did not have to right to invest in state projects such as those in Tennessee or the construction of the Maysville Road because it would give the Federal government too much control in local affairs. Thus, it was up to the states to conduct such improvement internally, making Tennessee's bill could be construed as an early precursor to this debate."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":11951,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1445,"title":"Maysville Road Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-22","end_date":"1830-05-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the most controversial Acts of its time, the Maysville Road act authorizing the purchase of 50,000 worth of stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Company, otherwise known as the National, or Cumberland, Road. To begin with, the road itself, or what was actually built of it, was a significant advance in construction technology. The four mile stretch that was constructed between Maysville and Washington, Kentucky as was a macadamized' road which was passable in virtually any weather conditions, and greatly reduced freight costs by allowing for heavier loads. Its fifty foot width involved innovative construction techniques such as drainage ditches, and marked a step forward in internal improvement technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project, however, had far more important national implications because there was a Constitutional question as to whether the Federal government could invest in a private corporation. Though Congress clearly believed the Federal government should encourage internal development this way, many Southerners believed that such investment was an infringement on states' rights because it would give the Federal government too much direct control. The Richmond Enquirer, for instance, wrote on May 25, 1830, that they do most religiously hope (President Jackson) will sign this Maysville Road Bill.' The Inquirer was therefore enthused to print Jackson's message to Congress on June 1, 1830, in which he return(ed) to the House of Representatives the enrolled bill.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Jackson's reasoning in vetoing the Maysville Road Bill is fairly straightforward, yet lay at the heart of the controversy at the time over the proper role of the Federal versus the state governments and the respective powers of each. In a later letter to Congress, reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830, Jackson writes that if the interest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to that of individuals, the management and control of a portion of the public funds is;.. beyond the supervision of our constituents.' Yet, at the same time, Jackson points out that the power which the Central Government would acquire within the several States by becoming the principal stockholder in corporations;. is almost inconceivable, and, in my view, dangerous.'

These links were vital in the pre-railroad era of 1830, because although railroads existed the U.S. was still very much a riparian economy. Thus, linking itself to this network not only improved shipping costs and speed throughout the region, but it also linked the local economy much more firmly into the national and international markets. This allowed for the flow of imports and exports, as well as the better communication of ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Louisville-Portland canal, however, was also an example of the great controversy at the time concerning the role of the Federal government in Internal Improvements. The Canal, which was constructed and run by a private company, included Federal investments which President Andrew Jackson called the first erroneous step ;..

Though Jackson agreed that improvement was vital to the U.S. economy, his decision to veto an additional investment in the company represents a strong, yet controversial, American and Southern sentiment at the time that the Federal government should not invest directly in private companies as it would give the government too much control.

William Henry Hatch of Missouri joined forces with Norman J. Coleman to create legislation that would promote all aspects of agriculture.  The Martinsburg Gazette reported that President Grover Cleveland approved the famous Hatch Act on March, 2 1887,' which created agricultural experiment stations in each state.  At these experiment stations, scientists worked with farmers, ranchers, suppliers, and processors to promote better food production at faster rates.  Also, the bill created an executive department to be known as the Department of Agriculture and Labor.  One of [the amendments] provides for the transfer of the Bureau of Labor to the proposed new department,' stated the Martinsburg Gazette.

Campbell expresses how the stations stimulated agricultural growth in Texas by saying, The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, established in 1887, researched every aspect of agriculture in [Texas] in an effort to increase production, lower costs, and expand markets.'

He declared the beauty and high value of the gold and quartz specimen qualities. Rice's arrival in the Gold Belt reflected the rapidly growing interest in the mining of minerals in Georgia. Many had declared Georgia mineral rich, and resulted in much interest from many areas. Since the Civil War, the investment of 10 million had already provided for the cost of 400,000 for flumes, and the development in new hydraulic mining techniques. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Belt spanned the distance of 300 miles from the boarder of Alabama to the Carolinas. People had known about the presence of gold, silver, copper, and other valuable minerals since 1829 when John Witheroods had discovered gold in Georgia, which resulted in thousands of intruders on Cherokee land. The Gold Rush in Georgia resulted in the establishment of a mint at Dablonega, but the Civil War brought its destruction. The Gold Rush had gradually died out because primitive mining methods failed to reach the inexhaustible mineral supplies other than those easily accessible. Slaves had done most the mining by hand, but with the end of slavery and the need for investment, new mining technology developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eagerness to develop mining in Georgia resulted from the poor state of the post-Civil War economy. Although many still placed hope in the revival of cotton farming, the cotton fields lacked much opportunity. Georgia, hit with economic depression in 1867 and a bad cotton crop, had no means to pay war indemnity, taxes and the high level of personal and public debt, or to reinstate itself into the market economy. People hoped the mining of minerals would bring economic revival, as mines would provide jobs and investment, pulling Georgia, especially the poor people of the mountains, out of their backward, impoverished state. The revival in mining did succeed in bringing millions of dollars of investment. Atlanta, especially prospered from it. As the natural outlet for the mining region, Atlanta established the new mint, and saw the development of 3000 houses, and a population growth of 30,000.  However, despite the romantic hopes of everyday men simply waking up to find 50,000 worth of gold, the gold mining in Georgia failed to help the poor, but helped the rich get richer."],"display_date":"March 13, 1867 - April 16, 1867","search_date":"1867-03-30","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1507,"title":"African-American Teachers Assert Themselves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-06","end_date":"1881-01-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the years immediately following the Civil War, the Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of the Colored People a localized precursor to the NAACP attempted to recruit African-American teachers and establish African-American schools.

Hart was living on a farm near the St. Mary's River in Florida.  Learning of the early successes of some small stores opened by white settlers near the Ferry Crossing on the St. John's River, Hart envisioned great potential for the area.  Making perhaps the most profitable decision of his life, in late 1820 Hart purchased what was then known as Cowford from settler L.Z. Hogans, trading cattle for the 18 acres of land.  At the time of Hart's acquisition, the population of Florida, without counting Native-Americans, did not exceed 12,000.   &lt;br /&gt;Because the Floridas were of interest to many other Southerners as well as Hart, Georgia's Southern Recorder provided a thorough description of the territory in an August 15, 1820 article.  The editor gave a precise explanation of the size and location of Florida for the many readers without access to a map or any other geographical background.  The Recorder primarily discussed the two major cities in Florida at the time, Pensacola and St. Augustine, but the article also went into detail about the agricultural advantages offered by Florida as a whole.  Although the soil was sandy, near rivers and lakes planters produced sugar, cotton, potatoes, corn, indigo, groundpeas, melons, plums, and many other goods.  Settlers found immense red and white oaks;mulberry, hickory, sassafras,' and typical animals such as horses, sheep, goats, cattle and swine, and in the deserts, otters, hares, rabbits, raccoons, and foxes (Southern Recorder).' &lt;br /&gt;The opportunity for economic growth in the Floridas, described by this and many other newspapers, provided the incentive for Hart's investment in Cowford.  The town lay in a valuable location in the northeast part of the territory and near a few bodies of water.  Hart built a boardinghouse and store, which soon became the heart of Jacksonville and made him a wealthy merchant and planter.  The city was incorporated in 1832, and once Florida became a state in 1845, it served as an important port specifically for timber and cotton trades.  Additionally, it would serve as a base for Southern blockade runners in the Civil War."],"display_date":"December 1820","search_date":"1820-12-16","locations":[{"id":2389,"lat":33.3278783249,"lng":-84.5112380239,"zoom":7,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1605,"title":"Georgia School of Technology Commences First Term\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-10-05","end_date":"1888-10-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 5th the Georgia School of Technology opened with around one hundred students.

Bell had gradually acquired all the companies that licensed its telephone equipment in what was known as the Bell System; the predominant driving force in telecommunication. In March of 1885, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) was founded under the license of American Bell. AT&T was originally intended to become a long -distance subsidiary of the Bell organization, but when the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation began to take off bringing in large profits it bought the assets of American Bell, creating a de facto in the American telephone monopoly.&lt;br /&gt;Protected by an unbreakable patent monopoly, AT&T engineers were able to formulate plans to create a system of interconnecting networks across the entire nation. While there were some set backs, such as lack of cooperation and agreement among the owners of the latter companies, vast improvements were made. Many investors didn't even consider the South to hold potential for further communications. Southerners with the necessary skills for maintaining telephone companies and outposts were in short supply due to the lack of education, rural poverty, and small amounts of industrial firms. However, unlike American Bell, AT&T recognized the importance and potential for telecommunications in the South. AT&T established central research and engineering departments, enhancing the technological development of their systems and creating more efficient and succinct means of communication nationwide. &lt;br /&gt;The telephone market was very competitive in the early 20th century. AT&T found untapped resources for business in the South, where it brought cheap service to places deemed unprofitable by Northern phone companies. Many cut throat tactics were used in the late 1800's by telecommunication businesses looking to get ahead. Short cuts and cheap, rudimentary alternatives were often used in less developed and therefore less suspecting regions of the country. Legal ploys and political propaganda caused many companies to sympathize with the South, calling themselves home' institutions who objected to the expensive, Yankee-owned enterprises of the Bell Company. Even AT&T officials spread rumors of loss of profit and poor earnings which caused nervous investors to sell stock in companies contracted to AT&T. AT&T then bought the stock in these companies cheaply, and soon established itself nationwide as the primary provider of telephone service, especially those overlooked in the South.

The Union's control meant the freeing of slaves.  This led to a shortage of agricultural labor and a scarcity of resources. This situation was further heightened by slaves who fled from nearby areas to the sanctity of Union borders. &lt;br /&gt;New Orleans was a particular example of this problem, as the black population there increased significantly from 1862-1880.  The overflow of population not only led to a shortage of food but also of jobs.  Thousands of hungry, tattered, unemployed blacks and whites roamed the streets.

He wanted niggers. In particular, he wanted the ability to hire an overseer, to raise himself to a higher class distinction. Some of his hunting buddies had overseers, and their constant dialogue about plantation life left Keen on the outside. He wanted nothing more in life than a plantation of niggers so I could talk about my overseer. Keen decided he would marry a rich, old widow to fulfill his slaveholding aspirations.","His first matrimonial expedition failed miserably. He found no rich widows waiting for him, and, in fact, he actually fell in love with one of the prettiest girls I ever saw in my life. Her name was Martha Hooker, but she was 16 and poor; she offered no hope of a suitable dowry to hire an overseer off of. Love was just a mere distraction to Keen. Over the next few weeks he began to write to a widow who filled the bill, but only received silence in return. Frustrated, he obtained a letter of introduction and set out to call upon the old lady. Her name was Rhoda Dean, and her youngest of nine children was 26. Keen was only 22. On his first visit, Keen got straight to the point, for he was never favorably impressed with long courtships; would she marry him? The answer took a few minutes but she consented. Numbers raced through Keen's head, for Rhoda Dean's estate was valued at seventy five thousand dollars. He could finally hire the overseer of his dreams and more slaves to accompany him. As Historian Walter Johnson might say, George Keen was constructing himself out of slaves, literally. Keen saw his value as a man in the amount of slaves he owned and if that amount qualified him to hire an overseer. He was affectionately called a Florida cracker, a plain folk white with little or no slaves. For Keen and other pioneers, he viewed his station as temporary. Non-slaveholding status preceded slaveholding without an overseer which preceded planter status. Each step Keen took in Columbia County brought him closer to the pinnacle, to manhood, and to conversing with his hunting buddies about their overseers.","Slaves were southern symbols of masculinity and whiteness, but they were also literal commodities and property. The ownership of property lay at the foundation of southern society and stood as a barrier to participation within that network. Political involvement, economic leverage, and social interaction hinged upon the amount of property possessed, and Keen knew this very well. He saw numbers everywhere. The widow was worth 75,000 dollars, and Keen himself was worth 4,000 dollars in niggers, land, cattle, horses, and money. Free blacks on Virginia's Eastern Shore in the seventeenth century were able to interact with patrons and have legal standing before the court because they leased, then owned, land tracts and raised cattle. As the South moved westward and into Florida, the frontier communities that developed were full of men like George Keen, ambitious, industrious men seeking opportunity in a society still forming. To progress upward in the hierarchy, Keen was willing to do anything, even marry a widow three times his age."],"display_date":1847,"search_date":"1847-07-02","locations":[{"id":1311,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"COLUMBIA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1951,"title":"Senator Lewis F.

As a doctor early in his life, Linn had seen thousands of cases of dysentery, malaria and other diseases that resulted from life along the Mississippi river. In low-water seasons, the outbreak of diseases increased as blockages in the river forced white and blacks alike to suffer with stagnation and mosquitoes; limited transport along the tributary waterways prevented medicine from reaching affected areas. The blockages accumulated during the low-water seasons of 1839-1843 described by Linn were so great as to render navigation not only dangerous in extreme to commerce but hazardous to the health.","Lewis Linn strove to make changes for his patients' health as well as his own after a series of illnesses he suffered in 1839. With the sudden death of the Missouri senator, Linn would realize his goal when nominated to the position. Linn realized, however, that to garner appropriations to clear out sandbars, large bulk and swampland from major waterways needed a stronger base than health-care reports. Linn worked alongside fifteen hundred St. Louis-area executives and presented a petition to Congress to battle those appropriations that were always strenuously, and sometimes successfully opposed, and the objects intended to be accomplished were never more than half accomplished.","Lewis Linn's work with executives strengthened his argument of the need for change, in both mercantilism and the health of those along the Mississippi. Linn cited the total loss of 3 million dollars in goods and boats along these waterways which were vital to much of the southern-and indirectly northern-trade and commerce. The enormous economic losses for the South and other ports nationwide sparked movement within Congress. As Linn fought to secure money, he created a promising outlook for a large-scale river project. Unfortunately, Linn's sudden death while in office in 1843 left his own efforts unrewarded when legislators failed to garner enough votes for appropriations.

The widespread alcohol abuse in St. Louis, the gateway to the West, caused many that passed through the city to comment on the wicked city containing an excessive number of deists and infidels. Some cited alcohol abuse as a result of the growing population that moved away from the church because of their involvement in more secular affairs, including journeying west. Ministers tried to resolve this problem quickly, especially when they viewed alcohol responsible for all of the ills of society: drunkenness, gambling, fighting, general disorder, Sabbath-breaking, and upper-class freethinking. "," By the 1830s, temperance societies sprung up in Missouri and throughout the South to combat alcoholism and end the noted loss of spirituality amongst those who were being swept up by alcohol's burning tide...to the gulf of eternal ruin. In early 1836, the Temperance Society of St. Louis called for a day of simultaneous meetings in which to rekindle the push for Prohibition, or at least temperance within the state of Missouri. The society noted that intemperance was never more rife, more open or more destructive to society and members wished to end the ravages...far more horrible than those of any plague or pestilence that ever swept through our borders. "," Within the religious South, the source of temperance societies and the influence of modern morality came from those who became largely involved in church life. The Missouri Temperance Society created an awareness of both social and physical abuse in the state when it called for a day of simultaneous meetings to help stop intemperance. Temperance societies tried to reduce the number of crimes and accidents that resulted from the use of alcohol. Included in the reported effects of alcoholism was abuse towards women, children, and slaves, especially in the South where moonshine, whiskey, and other drinks flowed freely. The widespread diffusion of temperance societies that occurred between 1830 and 1850 shifted the direction of the movement from one of alcohol in moderation to abstinence. In addition, the southern temperance movement that involved thousands spread to millions throughout the nation. Societies even invited women to take an increasingly important part in temperance work; the Women's Christian Temperance Union was established nationwide by the mid-1870s and remained influential through the 1920s."],"display_date":"January 21, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-21","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1958,"title":"The Observer&#39;s Slave Clothing Debate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-09-17","end_date":"1835-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Elijah Lovejoy, a staunch abolitionist living in Missouri, published and owned the St. Louis Observer. As part of his weekly papers, Lovejoy printed national and international news on a variety of subjects, most frequently the debate on slavery. Lovejoy printed one of these hotly debated articles on September 17, 1835, when Asa A. Stone's editorial article on the clothing condition of slaves in the South appeared in the Observer. Stone claimed that blacks' absence of clothing was a function of slave choice and low intelligence, not the poor treatment slaves received. The article angered free black supporters and abolitionists alike in Missouri and fueled further efforts of abolitionists who worked to erase the misconceptions printed by pro-slavery advocates."," This fight over slave conditions took on a fervent religious tone that highlighted the basic equalities of man, regardless of skin color. Lovejoy and his abolitionist publishing staff inserted an interesting caveat that preceded Stone's editorial. That the Christian slave-holders-at least so many of them as read the Observer-we only ask of every brother, when about to complete the bargain with the negro-driver...Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even to them for this is the law and the prophets. "," When Stone wrote that Thousands of Creole slaves of Louisiana do go naked, from choice, in the summer time...it is a common, I must say general practice to raise children without any clothing whatever, either in summer or winter, he failed to realize that many of these slaves did not wear clothes for reasons other than their inherent primitiveness. Often, economic conditions of black and white alike dictated what was available. On poor white farms and small plantations, the availability of fabric was limited only to white households. Hannah Jones, a former slave, recounted that for blacks without any source of income or education, it was impossible to gain fabric to clothe a family. As Jones' told of her experience, Old Marse Ben died and after dat Tom carried us all back down der to New Orleans wid him and opened up a n*r pen. Dat's a place like a stock yard where dey auction us off. We only know our ages by known' we is born in corn plantin' and cotton pickin' time. We never even knowed de days of de week. "," Many times, slaves only received new clothing when sold by slave traders. As Walter Johnson notes, future jobs slaves were to perform dictated clothing; future field hands dressed in far fewer and shabbier clothing than hotel workers or household workers. Often in addition, clothing covered up scars and illnesses in the marketplace, so nakedness was desirable in commodities sales. For slaves with particularly cruel masters, the scars left from whippings were often very visible. Another slave, Henry Johnson said, In de start de slave has been stripped naked, and lashed, often to death. Dey would be left strapped after from twenty-five to fifty lashes every two or three hours to stand dere all night...I never knowed what a shirt was until I was past twenty. "," The situation in which blacks lived in the South-for most, not of their own volition-sparked not only distaste of slaveholders, as Johnson notes, but the slave traders as well. Stone's editorial in the Observer brought further national debate on the premise of white superiority over blacks, especially in the South. The basic need for clothing ignored by slave owners, whether out of cruelty or poor economic success, could not be further avoided; even Stone himself stated that he could not comment on the debasing influence of a system that can produce such a state of things."],"display_date":"September 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-17","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1963,"title":"Ice as a New Commodity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-05-18","end_date":"1826-05-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alexander Gall advertised his ice delivery service in Portsmouth's <em>American Beacon and Portsmouth Daily </em>on May 18, 1826. Gall's advertisement ran in the local newspaper for a month. This allowed for the news of Gall's service to effectively spread among the people of Portsmouth. Gall brought ice to the homes of his customers in a horse-drawn wagon. Gall delivered ice daily to his customers who could afford to pay for the service. Gall advertised the options of a weekly or monthly subscription in the <em>American Beacon and Commercial Daily</em>. The American people quickly picked up on the amazing benefits of refrigeration, and Gall became one of thousands of men involved in the rapidly growing ice industry. Technological advances in refrigeration allowed for the development of the ice industry."," Gall received his ice from companies that harvested across the vast regions of North America. These regions experienced winters capable of freezing lakes and rivers solid. According to historian Gavan Weightman, companies checked the thickness of the ice after two or three weeks of subzero weather. Men harvested the ice once it froze to 18 inches; a depth that supported the weight of hundreds of men and horses. Men wore cork soles that allowed them to grip the ice, and fitted their horses with spiked shoes. Competing companies that worked on the same river or lake carefully observed boundaries pertaining to ownership. Men marked out the ice after clearing the snow on top to expose the ice surface. To mark the ice, men steered iron cutters drawn by teams of two horses across the surface. These men created a network of parallel lines that divided the area into squares. Horse-drawn plows with metal teeth cut deep enough into the groves that permitted men to pry the blocks free using long-handled chisels. Weightman claims that channels of free flowing water coaxed the giant ice blocks to a mechanism that hoisted them into timber icehouses. Blocks slid down chutes and men hauled them into stacks. These men put sawdust between and around the ice blocks to act as insulation. The discovery that sawdust could act as insulation allowed for the growth of the ice industry beginning in 1820."," Wagons draw by teams of horses or oxen carried ice from the timber houses to ports in nearby towns. Weightman claims that from these locations steamboats carried ice to large ice warehouses in city centers. The technological advances in steamboats, largely in part due to the development of the condensing engine, allowed for much faster transportation of ice."," Gall brought his wagon to the Portsmouth warehouse each morning to receive his supply of ice to deliver to his customers. The favored size of ice cube varied depending upon the location that companies transported the ice to. The size of ice cubes that Gall delivered to his customers in Portsmouth resembled that of a New-York sized ice cube of twenty-two square inches. In Portsmouth households, people kept blocks of ice cut to a standard size in what they called refrigerators or iceboxes. These refrigerators were predominantly built of wood and lined with metal. The technology of iceboxes created a way for Americans to store ice, thus increasing the demand for the valuable commodity. The variety of improvements in technology resulted in the growth of the ice industry."],"display_date":"May 18, 1826 - May 19, 1826","search_date":"1826-05-18","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1968,"title":"Sports of the Turf\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-05-12","end_date":"1822-05-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Portsmouth, Virginia the Greens Course hosted a series of horse races on Friday, June 15, 1822. <em>The American Beacon and Commercial Daily </em>posted advertisements for the event starting a month before officials scheduled for it to take place. This allowed time for news to spread throughout the region. It cost 20 dollars to enter a horse into the race, but owners who lived within a 50 miles radius of the racecourse did not have to pay an entrance fee. The horse races held at the Greens Course consisted of two laps around the track per heat. Horse races centered around gambling; a popular activity of southern men at the time."," The horse races at the Portsmouth Greens Course differed from quarter racing; the form of horse racing that Americans in the West created. Quarter horse races were far cheaper and easier to run because they did not require formal tracks. According to historian Earl L. Grinols, the races consisted of quarter mile sprints. The organizers laid the course out on a field or straight stretch of road that almost always ran next to the local tavern. Owners usually raced two horses against each other. This created a large amount of betting between the two owners as well as the crowd of spectators. Breeders crossed English saddle horses and Indian Ponies to create the new breed of quarter horses."," Races on the Portsmouth Greens Course tended to be far more controlled than the quarter horse races of the West. Spectators and contestants at the Portsmouth Greens Course concerned themselves with the rules of racing, while quarter horse races were anything but sedate events. Westerners accompanied quarter horse races with shooting matches, cockfights and boxing bouts. Since quarter horse races took place next to the local tavern, they often turned into very loud events with numerous members of the public under the influence of the local brew. Occasionally the Portsmouth Greens Course experienced the rowdy nature of western quarter horse races. Gamblers sometimes encountered corrupt bookmakers who dominated the betting by shortening their odds. These men disappeared from towns when they lost too heavily, and sometimes got caught bribing trainers and riders. Such events resulted in an uproar among the gamblers at the Portsmouth Greens Course.","Southerners found gambling to be an enjoyable activity while northerners viewed gambling as a vulgar European pastime.

Places such as Luray, Virginia, located in Page County, and other Appalachian mining areas became large centers of industry, attracting workers, railroads, and Northern investors."," However, with the depression of the 1890's still looming above their heads, miners in Luray, Virginia participate in a strike leading to a shortage of coal in the railroad industry. In covering this, the Page County newspaper unknowingly peers into the future of technology and transportation. The paper writes that the railroad companies (specifically the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy companies) begin to contemplate the idea of an oil-run machine, as opposed to their steam-powered locomotives. The companies believe that the change is both practical and desirable. They say that with an oil-run machine, fewer stops will be necessary on long trips and services such as the fast mail will be greatly improved, and have been conducting experiments to test the new technology at Aurora (probably Illinois). Thus, the coal miners' strike indirectly helped force railroad companies into a line-of-thought that will eventually help revolutionize the fuel industry."," Because of its entrenchment in the mining industry, citizens of small valley or mining counties could have a significant effect on the economy of a larger area as well as influence the progression of technology. This episode in Page County, Virginia is a peek at the near future, when oil gains its status as black gold. Poor, unhappy farmers and industrial workers such as the coal miners on strike will begin to move out to the oil fields in order to try their luck at finding wealth through drilling their own wells. This process was pushed along by the coal strikers and the railroad companies' desire to find a more efficient, available (not to mention controllable) source of fuel.","Date: June 7, 1894","Location: Luray, Page County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Economy, Migration/Transportation, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, Regional, National","Page Courier, June 7, 1894.

A Virginia newspaper, The Montgomery Messenger, shows great interest in the economic benefits of a more extensive merchant marine. In an article written on March 3, 1899, it cited the London Statist, claming that since the United States has developed its iron and steel industries, outlets for such products would be highly beneficial. The paper went on to affirm this, explaining that trade with other nations is only natural, and almost necessary in light of the country's growing industrialism. Thus, because naval vessels were the only way to reach countries on the other side of the ocean, more ships had to be built. The paper calls for the government to subsidize shipbuilding to a degree in order to put more American trading ships on the water."," The United States' iron output grew tremendously in the years following the Civil War and Reconstruction, specifically southern iron output. Over twenty years (1880-1900), southern iron output increased from 397,000 tons to close to 2 million tons. Thus, the interest Southerners may have had in building more ships with which to trade seems very reasonable, almost natural. The desire to enlarge the shipbuilding industry in the United States stemmed from the desire to put more American raw materials on a global scale in larger quantities, and the South with its rapidly growing industries was particularly interested in this. The South was a huge source of natural resources for the country, its goods ranging from timber, minerals, and of course, the many agricultural products that were produced in huge quantities during that time (cotton, grains, livestock goods, etc.). With a powerful merchant marine (and even more significantly, a Southern-based merchant marine) these myriad goods could be transported more efficiently and in larger quantities to any foreign buyer. The stronger merchant marine may even be beneficial during wartime, which it proved to be in World War I as the United States used the Europeans' war as a huge source of income. As money continued to pour into the South, the desire to expand its trade increased as well.","Date: March 3, 1899","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Agriculture, Economy, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, March 3, 1899.

The Montgomery Messenger, of Montgomery County, Virginia recognized this fact and in an article written on Friday, August 23, 1895, the writer discussed the benefits of a good roads convention. The convention was meant to be statewide and one delegate from each county was expected to attend; thus the event was of statewide significant importance, most especially to farmers and industrialists who wanted to get their materials across the state more efficiently. Furthermore, everyone interested in improving the state's roads was invited. The article goes on to explain that the State Good Roads Association had been very active in improving the infrastructure of the state, and that citizens of the state have every reason to feel satisfied and encouraged with the results of the association's work. The paper estimated (though the accuracy of this statement cannot truly be determined) that some 90% of the population believes in the importance of good roads. The article also went so far as to say that the remaining 10% would agree, if they simply thought about it for a moment. In addition, they estimated that the number of workers employed to improve the roads increased tenfold from the previous year."," Though these numbers seem rather outrageous and are likely to be incorrect and under-researched, the article is still testament to the importance of infrastructure improvement in the South. The burgeoning iron, steel, mining, and timber industries of the South called for better roads for transportations, to accommodate the moving of goods and the travel of northern prospectors and investors. Better roads needed to be built to transport raw materials to the newly built industrial centers located now in the South, unlike prior to the industrialization of the South where materials were either shipped overseas or sent north. Improving the infrastructure of the South (through roads and railroads) was crucial to the development of the quickly growing Southern economy and its important industries.","Date: August 23, 1895","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Politics, Government, Economy, Migration/Transportation, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, August 23, 1895.

Hovey had visited and mapped the caverns years earlier, claiming that he had been the source of the names of many of the geological and travel landmarks, with even a set of landmarks named after himself. His interest in the caverns seemed genuine, and the letter concluded with Hovey's assertion of his knowledge of the excavation taking place in the caves, and a request for any facts of interest about any caves in Virginia."," Upon careful reading, this seems like a rather peculiar way to end a seemingly friendly letter of interest.

They were called carpetbaggers, and their advantageous use of the South's developing economy was evident not only in tourism and mining, but in the development of infrastructure such as railroads and the expansion of the South's burgeoning urban centers. It is likely that H.C. Hovey of Newburyport, Massachusetts was a prospector of the mining or archeologist variety, with his strong interest in the excavations that more than likely took place in the unexplored sections of the mine. He could also be interested in taking advantage of the tourism sector of Luray's bolstering economy, but because the letter is so tactfully written, Zerkel may not have had any idea, and looking at the letter a couple centuries later, it is still difficult to tell. What can be sure, however, is that these types of exchanges were common throughout the Reconstruction period of South and the following several decades; the South's developing economy and industry was very attractive to financial prospectors in the north.

Hamilton ran a regular advertisement for his services in The Nashville Daily Union. In the advertisement he ran on Saturday, July 6, 1850, Hamilton reassured his former patrons that he planned to remain in the business of buying and selling cotton. Hamilton thanked the public for the business they provided him in that venture. Directly below he advertised his steamboat packets. Through this advertisement, Hamilton reintroduced himself as an agent of the steamers that traveled between Nashville and New Orleans, and Nashville and Memphis. In addition, the advertisement declared Hamilton's need to hire 100 NEGROES to work on the steamboats that traveled back and forth along these two routes. Although he claimed to want to hire these black workers, he did not necessarily mean to hire them independently. Some slave owners often hired their slaves out to others within their community, keeping the salaries for themselves. "," Hamilton advertised two types of steamboat packets. The first he described as regular packets traveling from New Orleans to Nashville. The steamers left the port of New Orleans every Tuesday at four o'clock in the afternoon for Nashville. The steamer left to return to New Orleans from Nashville every Saturday afternoon at four o'clock. The advertisement described the other packet as weekly. It left Nashville for Memphis every Monday at four o'clock and left to return to Nashville from Memphis on Thursday mornings at ten o'clock. "," Before railroads, steamboats provided the most rapid means of transportation of both people and goods. Tennessee played a large role in this river transportation. The Cumberland River ran through the middle of Tennessee eventually intersecting with the Ohio River. The Ohio River indirectly connected cities along the Cumberland River, specifically Nashville, with the burgeoning steam boat economy of the Mississippi River. "," The shipment of iron along the Cumberland River became a vital part of the economy in the middle region of Tennessee. Historian Byrd Douglas argues that if it had not been for the Cumberland River, which served as the only medium of transportation, this essential product, which played such an important part in the development of our country, could not have reached the market.

Tennessee did produce large amounts of the South?s staple crops, tobacco and cotton.

The soldiers had heard rumors of the great wealth of Georgia cotton planters. Now, with a freedman guide leading them to the house of Robert Paul where the ex-slave insisted they would find 15,000 in gold and silver, the soldiers hoped to seize a piece of that fortune for themselves.","The plan quickly fell apart. Arriving at the house, the soldiers took Mr. Paul captive and searched the place, discovering only their guide's disappearance into the night. Upset, the soldiers took what animals and possessions they could and set off down the road. Mr. Paul called on this neighbors and community. Soon, people gathered to the number of twelve or fourteen...among them many of the most respectable citizens of the county. This posse set off after the thieves, and while the soldiers had a considerable lead, they had no knowledge of the terrain. When the townsfolk caught up to the criminals, the soldiers opened fire, receiving a volley in kind from the assembled citizens. The soldiers ran, but did not make it far. One fell dead from his horse. The others, wounded and staggering, abandoned their horses and escaped into the nearby marshes. Paul recovered his property, excepting one bullet-ridden mare. The townsfolk reported the matter to the military government the next morning, who passed the investigation down the chain of command and eventually simply accepted the townsfolks' version of the events. The lieutenant in charge issued orders to commands around the city to arrest the escaped soldiers and to send someone from each command to identify the dead man.","     The military government's leniency in the matter differs greatly from the harsh, authoritarian rule of occupation armies in other parts of the South. Perhaps the military presence in and around Macon was too small to enforce order and welcomed the aid of civilians. Regardless, in the unrest and turbulence that followed immediately after the war, the occupation government in Twiggs County seems to have been remarkably willing to work with the local community, even to the extent of accepting dead soldiers. ","     In the immediate wake of being robbed, Mr. Paul did not seek the military government's aid in arresting its wayward soldiers. Rather, he resorted to a very common solution to crime and unrest in the 19th-century South - collective, vigilante justice. Despite the criminals' head start, the citizens of Twiggs County were able to spread the word, arm, organize, and catch up in only a few hours' time. This sort of call-to-arms, then, must not have been terribly rare. Indeed, even the most respected citizens of the county took part in the excursion - it seems that joining such a group was an honorable decision. Vigilantism, arguably native to America, was certainly engrained into this quiet Southern county. Long before lynching was synonymous with racial violence, communities in the Reconstruction South used collective violence to battle disturbances to the peace."],"display_date":"July 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-09","locations":[{"id":2289,"lat":32.670645545,"lng":-83.4297608837,"zoom":9,"place":"TWIGGS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2036,"title":"Richest County in the Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-03","end_date":"1857-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Different cultures define wealth in very different ways. In the minds of the citizens of Dougherty County, Georgia in the late 1850s, they were very wealthy indeed. According to the South Carolina Times in January of 1857, this plantation county claimed to be the richest County in the Union, excepting those containing the great cities. As evidence, they cited the per capita average of nine slaves valued at 5,000, and 10,000 worth of land to work them on. On whole, the county possessed land valued at 1,781,887; 980,000 in city property; merchandise worth 125,000; 650,000 liquid cash; and most importantly, 2,280,912 in slaves. This value, totaling over 5.8 million, is roughly equivalent to 119 million in 2005 U.S. dollars.","While Dougherty gloated, others mocked this definition of wealth. The New York Daily Times, hearing of this boast from its correspondent in South Carolina, saw the calculation in a very different light. The Daily Times pointed out the dominating value of slaves, then argued that by valuing white laborers at the market rate for slaves, each New York county would be far richer than Dougherty. Further, with only 125,000 worth of merchandise in the county, hundreds of stores in New York had more valuable merchandise than the entire Georgia county.","     Dougherty would indubitably have a different story to tell in 1865. The Daily Times might have added that the land in Dougherty was valued so highly because the highly profitable plantation economy drove up land prices. Even without the toll that the war extracted through destroyed infrastructure, seized crops, and the loss of much of the male population, the end of slavery surely crippled the fortunes of nearly all of Dougherty's wealthy planters. With land similarly devalued and any Confederate currency useless, Dougherty County could hardly be the richest county in the Union.","     Dougherty demonstrates the massive wealth that planters could accumulate in antebellum Georgia, as well as their complete dependence on the continuation of slavery to guard their investment in human property. Historians have debated for decades over the profitability of slavery, often centering the discussion on the question of profitable for whom? For Dougherty planters, at least, who counted slaves as market goods, this agricultural system led to enormous wealth."],"display_date":"January 3, 1857","search_date":"1857-01-03","locations":[{"id":1744,"lat":31.5332901076,"lng":-84.2164572289,"zoom":10,"place":"DOUGHERTY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2039,"title":"Bold Burglary Blamed on Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-07-14","end_date":"1868-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of July 9, 1868, the bustling town of Milledgeville, capitol of Georgia, witnessed a daring burglary. Casting subtlety aside, thieves approached Stetson & Brother's Store, drilled a hole through a window shutter, lifted the door's latch, and walked in through the front doors. Dragging the safe (so-called) from the backroom into the common area, the burglars forced it open, stole 500, and left without any real identification.","Police, combing the scene, had few real leads. They arrested several suspects over the ensuing week, but were unable to get any useful information from interrogations and soon let the men go. The community demanded security, so the police soon shifted to blame to a new target. On July 15, the Milledgeville Southern Recorder announced a reward for two negroes, strangers, [who] left on the Augusta train the next morning, suspected of being the leading characters...One of them of small stature, neatly dressed...can read and write and says he is from Boston. The other, is a large raw bone negro shabbily dressed, knock-kneed, and ugly looking face. The convenience of being able to target what sounds like a free, middle class, northern black man and a stereotype of a thieving slave is overwhelming. The Milledgeville police very likely chose two passing blacks as scapegoats, well-aware these suspects would never return to deny the accusation.","     Popular culture in the Reconstruction South cast free or idle black as drunks, thieves, and trouble-makers. This episode shows a desire amongst the authorities of Milledgeville to cast a middle- or upper-class black man in this same stereotypical role. The shorter suspect, educated and wealthy enough to travel from Boston and back, neatly dressed along the way, was a threat to some of the fundamental assumptions Georgian whites held about their black neighbors. If black were able to live civilized lifestyles when given the opportunity, it was no longer the white man's duty to look after an inferior race, but rather an act of oppression.

John Barker turned and sprinted towards his house, but the Indians were too quick. They overtook him, stabbing and killing him instantly. Caleb Lyndon Brayton, frontier neighbor to Barker, stood there stunned. He had just conversed with the Indian party on the road to Captain Gattis' house, seeing nothing unusual in their appearance. How could this have happened? The adrenaline flew through his veins: no time to think, get to the boats Brayton, Captain Gattis, and Colonel Russell flew down the hill towards the shore and pushed off just as the Indians, having doubled to eight, loaded their rifles. The first volley ripped through the shirt of a Negro man in the boat, but by the time they reloaded, the frontiersmen were out of range.","Brayton now had time to absorb what he just witnessed and plan a course of action. The men needed weapons, but, upon returning from obtaining Brayton's Colt 8 shooters, the Indians were no where to be found. The land lay in ruins. Houses were plundered and set ablaze and cattle floated lifelessly in the river. Colonel Russell's family was gone. The following day Brayton came upon the most distressing scene of his life: Here were a parcel of helpless women and children, bare footed and bare headed, and almost naked. The children crying and screaming for water and food, having been two days without anything to eat... They had found Russell's family downriver, but the horror of the past two days could not be escaped.","This was the scene Brayton described to his wife, Marian, who remained in Augusta, Georgia with their family while he settled the frontier of Florida. The Indians he refers to are Seminoles, and the attack and murder of John Barker was part of a larger reemergence of hostilities known as the Crisis of 1849. The Second Seminole War had been over for seven years, but a group of young Seminoles conducted raids up and down both Florida coasts in the summer of 1849. United States Troops mobilized and threatened attack but Chief Billy Bowlegs, who has been described as a great peacemaker, averted conflict by claiming the raiders were outsiders and defiant warriors. He delivered three prisoners and the severed hand of a fourth.","Scattered episodes of violence were not uncommon across the South wherever whites intruded into historic Indian territory, but the Crisis of 1849 was temporally concentrated and particularly horrific. Intricate racial interactions in Florida were augmented by the influx of settlers after 1842 and the peace that followed the Second Seminole War. Specifically, the Armed Occupation Act allowed prospective settlers to claim land and feel safer doing it; Caleb Brayton himself had claimed 160 acres in 1843 under this act. After 1849, however, many settlers did not return to this area and others. Billy Bowlegs had prevented a third Seminole war, but lasting damage had been done to the relationship between frontier settlers and the indigenous Seminoles.

He complained of pain in his head and extremities and writhed on the bed as his pulse and breath quickened. The disease came to him in the night on a vessel in the Key West Harbor. Dr. C.C. Dupre had no doubt it was the vomito prieto, the yellow fever of Cuba, and it was rapidly progressing to its fatal termination. Yellow fever had struck here before, decimating the forces of Commander Porter in 1823 and compelling his removal, and again in 1829. Since that time, however, outbreaks of the disease were episodic and affected only the younger, transient population, like this young sailor. The older residents had warned the doctor that this season had been forebodingly hot and dead flies lay on the shores in great numbers.","Dupre moved fast. He bled the patient and gave him thirty ounces of olive oil in three doses. He also let him drink freely of the anti-febrile pineapple water. Other remedies he considered were almond oil, lime juice, and calomel in doses from 20 to 30 grams. Over the next two days, the sailor improved greatly, his skin cooler to the touch and the yellowness of his eyes dissipating. In his journal, Dupre recounted that encounter with the deadly disease and others over the course of his summer in Key West; the greatest number of cases occurred during a ten day period in mid-July.","Of greater importance to physicians all over the South were the origin and vector of the disease. Dupre put forth his hypothesis that the elevation of the site, the humidity of the soil, and the presence of marsh miasmata were only secondary influences in its genesis. Yellow fever would remain a mystery for much of the century, drastically altering the development of southern cities.","Almost fifty years later, Dr. J.C. LeHardy read a report in front of the Medical Association of Georgia that echoed Dupre's journal. Elevation was clearly a factor, as epidemics in St. Augustine originated in the low, rain-washed suburbs around the city. The moisture in the soil and the tropical sun that bathed the South were also primary factors in the breeding of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the vector of the disease. LeHardy asked the Medical Association how the South, a region that clothed the world and fed the hemisphere with her long growing seasons and immense forests, could have no large cities. He answered the question himself; the lakes, lagoons, and swamps across the region created an atmosphere for a horrific contagion that only drainage of the soil through canals and cleanliness could remedy. ","Dupre and LeHardy were not alone in their frustration. Yellow fever disrupted the entire fabric of life in the South. Many lost faith in the medical profession as they struggled to find answers, and outbreaks brought commerce to a complete halt. An epidemic in Pensacola in 1822 caused so many residents to flee inland that the Floridian, a prominent newspaper, shut down for lack of revenue. Outside investment capital saw the South as a risk. A later Florida epidemic in 1841 decimated such a large part of the population that it almost delayed Florida's admission to the Union. Florida, in close trading proximity to Havana, Cuba, was especially prone to importation of the disease. ","Despite all yellow fever's devastating effects, it fueled the growth of public health in the South. State legislatures created Boards of Health to prevent and isolate outbreaks, and the United States Public Health Service acquired funding, staffing, and authority to combat yellow fever. Throughout the nineteenth century, citizens demanded greater government involvement in disease control and better institutions to meet their needs."],"display_date":"June 8, 1841","search_date":"1841-06-08","locations":[{"id":1426,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2058,"title":"Hitting Shore With a Vengeance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Haynie Bradshaw thanked God every time he arrived back on shore. Oystermen were reputed to be daring and unscrupulous men, who regard[ed] neither the laws of God nor the laws of man, but Bradshaw was a devout Methodist who sometimes led services on Sunday. As an oysterman, Bradshaw dredged the Chesapeake Bay aboard one of the infamous bugeye boats. It was a terrible living. Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery. All the buildings had holes in the floors to toss away emptied shells. The entire town smelled of dead oysters. Girls on the street corner outside Blizzard's were hardly discreet about their employment. The town's residents used guns to disperse the rowdy drunks prowling the streets after dark. While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other. The saloon in Crisfield was a far cry from his Methodist Church back home.","While the slavery system ended years earlier, the free labor system for both blacks and whites could be awful as well. In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry. Both blacks and whites were often exploited by the system of sharecropping, where a farmer worked another man's land in return for a small portion of the crops.

One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity.

He made the 40 mile journey by railway; this was Mr. Rawlins first time in Washington.  Traveling was not as accessible when Richard Rawlins was a child.  Therefore, this trip to Washington was a thrill for him. After registering at the Gadsby's Hotel in Washington, Rawlins journeyed down to the capital.  He entered the Rotunda, immediately drawn to four large hanging pictures.  The subjects included, The Declaration of Independence, The Surrender of Cornwallis (1781), The Resignation of Washington (1783), and the Surrender of Burgoyne (1772).  These were so powerful that Rawlins reflected in his journal, They bear such internal evidence of truth that the beholder is almost constrained to forget everything else in looking at them.  A bronze statute of Jefferson, seems to cause a thrill of admiration.  Next he ventured into the Senate.  Again the details of the splendid room stuck his attention.

One moment he was laughing and joking with friends; then his life changed drastically. He received a letter from home. Upon opening it, he fell directly to the ground, as if he had been shot. The first words he managed to utter, Every tie to life is broken He had received new of his daughter's death. Although he became more composed as the day progressed, he was heartbroken. Ann was his pride and joy, and of all his children she was his greatest comfort. She was frank, gay, and warm hearted. Ann married a very rich man and lived on a plantation adjourning Clay's. They interacted daily. Of five daughters, Ann was the last. Mrs. Clay also suffered at the thought of life without the joy of her daughters. Mr. Clay responded to a sympathy letter on December 31, 1835. In this he thanked a friend for her kind words but explained, All the efforts of friendship or of my own mind have but little effect on a heart as wounded as mine is. His dear Ann had tastes, sympathies, and amusements identical to his own. She was interwoven into every plan he held for his future. The loss of Ann was one that could never be repaired, there is nothing before me in the world but duties. ","Henry Clay was one of the top political players during this time in United States history. This letter, describing his deep loss and the pain Ann's death brought him, provides a very personal glance into his life. Clay served in both the House and the Senate and, despite his multiple failed attempts at the Presidency, he still managed to leave his mark on history. He was the founder of the Whig Party, in opposition of Andrew Jackson. Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra describe Clay in their book, New Histories of the Old Dominion, Virginia Reconsidered, as a man who brought to the political stage the very qualities women did on the domestic one- moral virtue, love of harmony, and the willingness to compromise. They go on to say that women were endeared to him. Perhaps this affection, passion, and love of harmony are in part a reaction the great loss of his dear Ann. Clay's favorite word was harmony and he has gone down in history as a peacemaker and the Great Pacificator. On Christmas day, 1835, Clay suffered a loss that would forever change him. He continued his political career and channeled his energy into his belief and desire for harmony."],"display_date":"December 25, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-25","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2165,"title":"Freedmen&#39;s Marriages\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-07-16","end_date":"1867-07-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" At the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, two million slaves suddenly found themselves emancipated from the system of bondage that they had known their entire lives. The United States was in a unique situation in which it was not quite sure how to handle the differences between its new society with all freed African Americans, and its old slaveholding one. In order to help the refugees of the Civil War, and to establish a sense of stability in the country during this precarious time, the United States government formed the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned lands in March 1865. Immediately, the Bureau found its main challenge to be that of helping the freedmen acclimate to their new situation."," Members of the bureau in De Soto, Mississippi, sent a report dated July 15, 1867, to General O.O. Howard. It stated that it seems impossible to make the ignorant class of freed people understand their marriage relations. Husbands leave wives and wives leave their husbands. The Assistant Commander had some of them arrested, and after explaining to them their duties and obligations in this respect, induced them to return to their homes and live together amicably. "," Due to the fact that marriages between slaves were not legally recognized before the Civil War, and subsequent emancipation of the slaves, the Freedmen's Bureau was responsible for solemnizing formerly unrecognized slave marriages. In Mississippi alone, more than 4,000 marriages between African Americans were legally legitimized by the Freedmen's Bureau by 1866. These former slaves appreciated the recognition of their marriages in a legal fashion a great deal. They could only be socially married while enslaved, forcing them to be at the mercy of their masters in terms of being sold away from their spouse. Many found themselves separated from the ones they loved, and had oftentimes formed a family with. "," Sometimes slave parents' sense of fidelity was lessened as they were sold away from their partners and they subsequently had no control over the fate of their children and familial relationships. Certainly not all freedmen felt this way, and there was a great deal of fidelity throughout the black community. However, many former slaves did find themselves in polygamous situations at the conclusion of the Civil War when the Freedmen's Bureau helped to restore their original families. Like in the report from De Soto, Mississippi, this caused some freedmen to leave the person they were now considered legally married to, who they had not been with for perhaps years, because they had produced children with that person. The Bureau in Mississippi tried to force these separated couples back together in an attempt at stability and fidelity. Whether or not these couples listened and stayed together is unknown, but it was the newfound stability of the living circumstances for freedmen that caused much of the instability among them because they were so accustomed to life without it."],"display_date":"July 16, 1867","search_date":"1867-07-16","locations":[{"id":7019,"lat":34.7811371772,"lng":-89.974549402,"zoom":9,"place":"DE SOTO, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2173,"title":"Improving Schools in Augusta County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-07-28","end_date":"1842-07-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Pride was the driving force of Augusta County, Virginia- pride and patriotism not only for the country, but for the county as well. Augustan citizens therefore became quite disgruntled when one of the adjoining counties earned the venerable title, Athens of the Valley due to the assiduous efforts it made to improve its county's schools. One agitated Augusta resident in particular took it upon himself to rally his brethren to address the need to improve schools within Augusta. In an article he had published in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em>, this passionate citizen questioned the county's efforts in utilizing its resources to educate its children by asking, What are we doing for ourselves? Are we tutoring the minds of our youth up to the standard which would seem to befit our physical advantages? Furthermore, he delegated to the patrons and trustees of Augusta County schools the responsibility of giving energy to those who taught so that they could then stimulate their pupils. Finally, he argued that at the heart of the issue in improving the county schools was the need for cooperation amongst the communities and neighborhoods internally. He stated that only then [would they] see the cause of education advancing. ","Augusta County citizens viewed schools not only as a means of receiving academic education, but moral education as well. The author of the aforementioned article in the Staunton Spectator stated that another benefit of improving county schools was the inevitable correction of a variety of evils which [then marred] their prosperity. Historians William J. Cooper and Thomas E. Terrill identify the reasons why Augusta County needed to make such an appeal in their novel depicting the history of the American South. They state that there was not a public school system in Augusta until 1853. Until then, Southern states instituted charity schools for those who could not afford to pay for education. In order to receive the services of these charity schools however, citizens would have to formally declare their inability to pay for education. The ardent pride of Augusta County citizens many times prevented those who could not pay for education from formally declaring so, and therefore these schools were often undersubscribed."],"display_date":"July 28, 1842","search_date":"1842-07-28","locations":[{"id":13637,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2176,"title":"Institution of the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind School","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-10-10","end_date":"1839-10-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["An article in the Staunton Spectator informed its readers that the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind School would open for admission in November of 1840.

The School also required that each pupil enroll for a minimum of two years. Deaf mute applicants had to be between the ages of seven and 25, and blind applicants had to be between the ages of seven and 18. Exceptions to these prerequisites would be considered by the executive committee. However, these exceptions had to be of good natural intellect, free from any immoralities of conduct or any contagious disease. ","The construction of such an institution is most likely a Whig reform. In <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>, historian Elizabeth R. Varon illustrates the Whigs as a party interested in moral reform, public education, and giving societies. The Whig Party dominated Augusta County before the election of 1840, believing that its emphasis on education and wealth affirmed its superiority to the emerging Democratic Party in the South.

The performance of the Stonewall Brigade Band of Staunton confirmed the friendship that existed between the two sister cities of the Valley of Virginia, Staunton and Winchester. The Brigade Band performed to the general delight of all present outside the Commercial Hotel in honor of Captain W. L. Clarke, an old citizen of Staunton and the mayor of Winchester. One listener named the band the capstone of the civic virtues, illustrating the pleasure the music gave those in attendance. Mayor Clarke, as well as many other men, responded to the tribute made by the concert with addresses discussing the feelings of friendship existing between the neighboring towns.","  The performance highlighted the value that the inhabitants of Augusta County placed on an amiable alliance between sister towns and the qualities they treasure in their citizens. An attendant of the performance observed that brass was usually recognized as essential to success, and that he did not know any equal number of men who had more brass or knew how to use it better than the Stonewall Brigade Band. His comment highlights not only an appreciation of the skill of the musicians, but also the importance of brass, strength and confidence in a man, which is necessary for him to be triumphant. ","  The time for the South to remain confident came prior to the 1880 election. After the decline in Republican votes in the South in the election of 1878, the Radical Republicans identified a need to change the political distributions to dominate Congress if they were to attempt any government action in the South. Historian James M. McPherson describes how by 1879, they realized that a unified North had to outvote the solid South. While the North sought to show the South that they would no longer dominate the government, the South continued to reinforce the bonds that kept them politically united, furthering McPherson's argument by suggesting the implications of the attempts to form a solid North on the South. The playing of Staunton's Stonewall Brigade Band connected Staunton to her neighboring city of Winchester, strengthening the sisterly feelings that existed between these two cities of the Valley. Communication between cities allowed the sharing of ideas and news, both political and social. When election time arose, it is more likely that these cities would vote similarly because they had a vested interest in one another. It is connections such as these between Staunton and Winchester that formed the solid South, relationships that the North would like to break after the 1878 election.

They issued a statement of the services they would provide and the fees at which they would provide those, proclaiming themselves, the Culpeper Medical Society. Their proclamation listed a variety of techniques and operations, with prices in the adjacent column. The services available ranged from the treatment of a blister at 50 cents to the amputation of a thigh or leg for 20 to 30 dollars. Included in the document are clarifications on the price difference for treating a white person and a black person. For example, the natural delivery of a white woman would cost ten dollars, while the same procedure for a black woman would cost a total of five dollars."," After the prices were listed, resolutions of the Medical Society were put forth as the members said we bind ourselves...that all accounts should be considered due on the first of January of each year and that no diminution in the foregoing rates of charges shall be made, but the Physicians may deduct from the aggregate amount of his bill, from motives of charity only. Twenty physicians then signed the agreement. The writing of this document by the regular practitioners of medicine in the county supports Todd Savitt's claim in <em>Fevers, agues, and cures: Medical Life in Old Virginia</em> that the medical profession was not an easy one in Virginia in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Patients called on doctors at all hours of the day in all variety of weather conditions, to tend to the needs of the sick in their community. Additionally, while they would provide services at any time, they would in general not be paid until a given point in the year. The establishment of medical societies such as the one in Culpeper, had both social and practical purposes. As Savitt points out, the medical societies provided both intellectual and communal support to physicians, as they exchanged knowledge about medicine and treatments or simply socialized with each other. According to Savitt city- and county-wide societies existed in Richmond, Charlottesville, Winchester, Petersburg, Fredericksburg, and Norfolk and in numerous counties throughout Virginia.

Their son, Glenn, worked nearby on a tugboat that went up and down the Mississippi, and Frank, a tinsmith from New Orleans, continued a desperate search for work throughout the year. Alice, also out of work, remained on the houseboat most of the time, except for a few explorations of the city of St. Louis on foot to entertain herself. Both Frank and Alice wrote regularly to their brother and sister, Arthur and Ellen P. Thrasher. The correspondence from Frank and Alice to Arthur and Ellen illustrates the fact that Frank and Alice are having serious financial troubles harbored in Missouri, from which they cannot seem to get out from underneath. Alice wrote to Arthur on August 2, 1897, not a thing to complain about, only the lack of income. And consequently running behind financially. Alice spends much of her letter to Arthur relating to him how she felt blue and worried almost obsessively over finances, although she was very proud of Glenn for having a job, which was not easy to come by in St. Louis in that time. ","Alice made it very clear in her letters that the living and working conditions of St. Louis were uncomfortable and poor compared to other cities she lived in before that were farther south, like New Orleans. In her letter of August 2, And if we ever succeed in getting out, I think we will give it a 'wide berth' in the future. Alice and Frank had plans to sell the boat to the first buyer and head for home via New York City, but as Frank observed in a letter written on August 24, 1897: There don't seem to be anyone around here with money enough to buy a boat yet but I still am thinking there will be before many weeks now. Frank, who was a little more optimistic in his letters to his relatives than Alice, wrote in a letter postmarked July 12, 1897, Business is about the same with us. I have no work yet but think will have some soon. I put an ad in the paper and may hear something from that but will not be surprised in case nothing comes of it as money is sure scarce. ","From living on a houseboat, the Thrashers were able to get a broader perspective of conditions up and down the Mississippi than most southerners. Alice was aware of St. Louis in relation to other cities in the North and South, which she made clear in her August 2 letter: I am convinced this is the very largest city I was ever in. I have found just that it claims nearly 700,000 population. And since Brooklyn has helped to swell New York city's population, St. Louis has become the 4th city in size in the U.S. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago being greater; they, running up into the millions in counting their population. She was also aware of the conditions in New Orleans because of her family there. When Mrs. Alice Thrasher wrote to their relations in New Orleans, she indicated that they were well off, and at times was slightly jealous in the letters to her sister, Ellen, Your letter was 'breezy and hopeful': I only wish I had some of the of the work that you and Aunt Lil each do. But while I have not, I am not so one- sided in my sympathies that I can't feel glad that you are prospering. "," Frank and Alice were well-traveled, and could see the differences not only between the cities of the northern and southern parts of the South, but the differences between the North and South as a whole. They often noted in their letters that their poor economic standing was not uncommon in other southern cities in the nineteenth century. Instead of a middle class, the South and its, conservative form of urban industrialism after the Civil War gave birth to a fairly economically polarized society. Factors that caused this gap between the very wealthy and very poor might have been a combination of economic, social and political factors which kept the region off what Jonathan M. Wiener called the classic capitalist path that had been blazed by England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and followed by the northern states. There was a large expectation for the South during Reconstruction to quickly join in the industrial revolution of the North. But cities like St. Louis, although big and bustling, did not always provide enough jobs for skilled craftsmen. Factories wanted men who could act as cogs in textile mills, not men like Frank Thrasher who was a skilled tinsmith. Even if Thrasher took a job in a factory, wages were shockingly low. Historian William H. Nicholls argued that perhaps, had the pace of the South's post-bellum industrial development matched that of the earlier industrial Revolution of England or New England... The Southern middle class would have flowered more profusely. Some historians, like Wilbur J. Cash, argue that because economics in the South were originally based on plantations, the region's middle class remained subservient to the values of the planter, the result of which was an economy that only benefited a small but powerful coalition of planters, merchants and industrialists. Cities like St. Louis in the nineteenth-century urban South did not get the economic boom for middle class men like Thrasher that the North did."],"display_date":"1895 - 1898","search_date":"1896-12-31","locations":[{"id":8037,"lat":38.6358212793,"lng":-90.2450510752,"zoom":11,"place":"ST LOUIS CITY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2280,"title":"The Future of Miami\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-05-25","end_date":"1844-05-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The little coastal steamer, only 105 feet in length and 152 tons in weight, chugged up the Miami River towards the settlements on the interior.

Upon arriving at Miami, he found it to be little more than a collection of armed occupants, so called, receiving from government a certain quantity of land as a grant, in a suffocating tropical environment. Possible fertile river bed soil was made worthless by layers of limestone, and the horizon stretched off into a pine barren land.

In geographical terms, Miami is situated between the Bay of Biscayne to the east and the vast Everglades to the west. The area is a virtual swampland, abundant in peat and humid soil and averaging 65.5 inches of rainfall per year. Miami was not adapted for general agricultural development, and outsiders, such as Anderson, gave the settlement up for dead in 1844. The story of how Miami came to be one of the leading cities in Florida, the South, and the nation in the twentieth century is one of natural resources and an adaptive economy.","The antebellum history of Miami is marked by the same patterns as other Florida cities: Indian attacks, hurricanes, and poor agriculture. Miami became the seat of Dade County in 1844, the same year Master Anderson visited, but the county's population would decrease from 446 in 1840 to 85 in 1870. To put this in perspective, Dade County is almost the size of the state of Massachusetts. This mass migration was due, in part, to Seminole hostilities; the settlement did not recover. Miami's identity as a city would begin to take shape after 1870. Pioneers won their lands from the jungle around Miami and soil was reclaimed through canal drainage systems. Population rose to 861 in 1890, 3,322 in 1895, and would explode in the twentieth century with the extension of Henry M. Flagler's East Coast Railroad to Miami in 1896. Miami emerged as a resort and tourist destination and remains such to this day. ","Florida was very different from the rest of the South: stormier, swampier, less networked by railroads, and ravaged by Indian wars. With the exception of the Cotton districts in west and central Florida around Tallahassee, Florida failed to be a major cash crop producer. It excelled in citrus plantations but little else. Early on, Miami just did not fit in the mold of a prosperous southern city. The economic system was agricultural, and Miami could not function within that system and was pushed out of it. Even in 1880, Miami was practically nonexistent. Anderson would have seemed to be correct about the city and its settlers. Miami, along with other Florida cities, adapted with the system, and the advent of sophisticated railroads and the tourist industry gave Miami a specialization it could do well. A look back at Miami in 1844 shows how the physical surroundings and geographic location of settlements are the most important determinant of how cities develop, when they develop, and how they will be judged as a success by outsiders."],"display_date":"May 25, 1844","search_date":"1844-05-25","locations":[{"id":1317,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DADE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2302,"title":"Son Writes to His Mother from School in Baltimore\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-10-14","end_date":"1878-10-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shirley, going to school in Baltimore, Maryland, wrote his mother about his life in Baltimore and also reflected on how he wished to take care of her.

Because of this, there was less money to spend on education and commonly if money was tight, boys were favored to send off to school. Poor white women had to look for work. Southern ideals, however, called for women to stay away from masculine things like politics and work or else they would corrupt their femininity.","Shirley may have held this idea of womanliness, wanting to come home and help her so she would not be ruined by such masculine endeavors. Shirley may also have simply been concerned with the economic state of his mother.

In 1885, both timber businessmen and railroad executives repetitively brought cases to the Secretary of the Interior concerning the cutting of timber in certain areas of Alabama. These lands, amounting to some 200,000 acres of fertile soil and dense forests, were granted to the state in order to aid the construction of the Mobile and Girard Railroad in 1856. The Alabamians that wanted to cut timber on the lands claimed that the railroad had no valid title to the area because Mobile and Girard failed to abide by the terms upon which the land was given to them. The Secretary requested that the Attorney General get right to work because the conflict between these two interest groups had been steadily growing, and the state government needed to make a finite decision concerning the issue so as to pacify the competitors for the land usage.","A case of a land controversy such as this would have been common in the late nineteenth century as railroads were becoming an increasingly important means of transportation and focus of development. In 1881, Alabama formed a railroad commission to deal with issues such as land allotment for the building of railroads. The commission helped to organize and solve many problems with the railroads development, but they also created problems with citizens, such as the conflict with the timber producers.<em>The Mobile Register </em>frequently featured articles and commentaries against the commission, saying that from everywhere arose the cry of an oppressed people against the arbitrary rule of the great railroad corporations. Therefore, like the timber producers in 1885, many citizens of the Gulf Coast area felt that the railroad companies had unfair privileges and took advantage of the state, and frequently opposed the development of more railroad funding and support in local and state government.

Cities all over the lower South were experiencing high numbers of deaths from the terrible illness. On September 17, in Mobile County, two more citizens were diagnosed with yellow fever and died, leaving the Mobile residents in a panic. The victims resided in the section of the city bound by Beauregard, State, and Conception Streets-the area in which the majority of the other cases had been reported. Fortunately, however, there had only been five cases of yellow fever reported in Mobile since Dr. William Ross diagnosed a patient on August 16, a case which also ended in death. Until these deaths, Mobile seemed to be faring well with the illness in comparison to other cities in the Gulf Coast region. However, in addition to the two fatal cases officially reported to the board of health on September 17, another case was reported just a day later. Mobile would have to cope with the spread of this deadly illness along with the rest of the Gulf Coast, although not to the same extent. In New Orleans, for example, there had been 195 cases reported and fifty-five deaths on September 16 alone. The plague traveled up along the Mississippi River from the coast, spreading to Vicksburg, Memphis, Cincinnati, and other towns bordering the river.","This was not the first season of terrible medical records in the South. Between 1650 and 1900, yellow fever swept the Gulf Coast in repetitive waves. The disease tended to thrive in the area, with its tropical humid climate, and came in epidemics. Yellow fever was a particularly daunting epidemic in that it was characterized by a sudden onset, and if fatal, death within a week to ten days. Therefore, doctors like Dr. William Ross found it extremely difficult to treat or cure because by the time one was diagnosed, patients were either almost dead or recovering naturally. In the Gulf Coast region, the fever tended to come in the warmest months of the year. Therefore, many citizens fled from Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida during the summer and fall months in an attempt to escape the fever. Fortunately for blacks, their Barbados and African ancestry made them less susceptible to the disease than white people, so they were often able to remain at home without fear of catching the fatal virus. These bouts of yellow fever along the Gulf Coast continued until the great epidemic of New   Orleans in 1905, and then the disease seemed to fade away.

Sitting on the banks of the Deep River, the new Island Ford Manufacturing Company directly faced the Randolph Manufacturing Company.  In less than a year the handsome three-story building sprang up with capital of 14,000, and the company began by running 528 spindles.  It is no surprise that the local paper enthusiastically greeted the new factory and predicted it would be crowned with success, for the economy of Franklinville relied upon the textile industry.  Newspaper editors expected that the capital would increase quickly to 20,000, and that operating spindles would soon double in number.  ","The construction of an impressive cotton factory in North Carolina's Piedmont attests to the dominance of cotton and local efforts to capitalize on its production.  Franklinville was in many ways a suitable location for a cotton mill in North Carolina due to its relative proximity both to a source of falling water and the coastal region.  As North Carolina's Piedmont stretches south and west, increasing distances to markets made freight prohibitively expensive; Franklinville was successful because of its atypical location.","Despite the efforts of the planter class to industrialize the Old South, Stephen Goldfarb dismisses the few textile mills of North Carolina as almost insignificant in comparison to the major industrial areas of New England in antebellum America.  North Carolinians in 1848 had reason to celebrate industrial growth, but ultimately antebellum North Carolina would not process its cotton to the extent that rivaled Northern and international operations.  While the impressive amount of capital and infrastructure attest to optimism, North Carolina's cotton mills rarely exported their manufactures.  Factors including dismal transportation options and lack of capital limited cotton manufacturing to meeting local demands, especially before the arrival of railroads to most regions of North Carolina.  The new manufacturing company, nevertheless, testified to a burgeoning period of economic growth that aided North Carolina in undertaking certain internal improvements. Until the complete establishment of railroads after the Civil War, prohibitive distances between falling water that powered the mills and coastal seaports helped prevent Southerners in the Piedmont from rivaling Northern mills."],"display_date":"April 12, 1848","search_date":"1848-04-12","locations":[{"id":9736,"lat":35.7102732834,"lng":-79.8060567039,"zoom":9,"place":"RANDOLPH, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2418,"title":"Governor Issues Plan for Establishing Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-12-04","end_date":"1848-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Governor Graham called upon the North Carolina Senate for action in implementing his plan to install continuous railroad from Gaston to Charlotte and connecting 250 miles of North Carolina's piedmont.

In the Governor's estimations, 500,000 North Carolinians would benefit from the railroad extension.

The State's remaining balance would be paid from the issuance of 30-year State bonds paying six percent per annum.  The state would present its first 500,000 of assets, he argued, only after individuals had first purchased the same amount.

Graham, the third of four consecutive Whig North Carolina Governors, was continuing an era of progress with internal improvements that sought to solve the State's dire need for improved transportation.  Even among Southern states, where transportation greatly limited most states' economic horizons as compared to Northern states, North Carolina was considered backward.  Stephen Goldfarb explains the tardiness of Southern industrialization as a consequence of poor transportation to coastal ports.  Distances of one to two hundred miles between the fall lines of rivers and their coastal outlets, a feature of the North Carolina Piedmont, required the advent of railroads. The State's earlier attempts to organize a productive rail line between Wilmington and Raleigh remained a money-losing venture for the State.

They relied on nature to provide them with their livelihood, the planting of rice and other crops. Charles Heyward resided in Charleston for most of the year, but controlled many plantations outside of the city, including Rose Hill, Amsterdam, and Lewisburg Plantations. By 1860, he owned 471 slaves. Therefore, it was in his best interest to record a journal like the one he kept during the years 1835-1855. It was to his benefit to record patterns in the weather.","Heyward recorded that June and July of 1840 were unusually cold and rainy for the summer months, putting a strain on the crops. He noted that although this kind of weather was favorable in the city, it was detrimental to the countryside where his plantations were located. In addition, August was a very wet month, which injured many of the crops and forced an early and unfavorable harvest. The cotton crop was injured the most. In the South during this time, cotton reigned supreme among crops. For a cotton harvest to fail like this created economic alarm among South Carolinians and Southerners in general. The year 1841 did not bring a good harvest, either. In fact, Heyward noted that it brought the worst harvest the area had seen in years. Although it came in September that year, relatively on time, the rain arrived that year in conjunction with the excessive high tides, which crested the river banks and caused the harvest to be quite deplorable.","The weather was just one of many factors that caused Charleston's cotton exports to fall sixty percent between 1821 and 1842. Business was terrible in the Charleston cotton market. Reportedly, grass was growing in the streets by 1842. Charlestonians grew alarmed because each member of the city's society, from slave to wealthy planter had a stake in agriculture. Planters and their families had less money; slaves were treated worse because of the darkened moods of the planters and overseers. They tended to blame slaves for bad harvests since they were the ones working with the crops. It was up to publications like The Southern Agriculturist to help planters think through their options in an effort for agriculture to become profitable once again. Theodore Rosegarten's essay The Southern Agriculturist in an Age of Reform, highlights a society based on the riches of the harvest. Because planters were arguing about what was causing their problems, The Southern Agriculturist was created to help scientifically sort out the issues of the growing season.

Railroads remained important for supplying goods to others for economic profit. However, poor track conditions often made for delayed trips and spoiled products. Train delays plagued the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. The A&C tracks were in horrible condition following the Civil War and in need of funding for improvements.","In conjunction with the endorsement law, the Alabama legislature found the necessary funds to reequip the railroad, restoring it to working order. However, what the state supplied was not nearly enough. Trustees and bondholders in the business incurred significant debt to be paid off over time to the state government of Alabama. Those related to the A&C began searching for land to acquire in hopes of eventually expanding the entire railroad system. Friends of the railroad system ironically enough were those who had a substantial strong hold on state politics in Alabama. Internal corruption commenced when these friends did political favors for the railroad. Fraudulent funding and land purchases orchestrated by insiders, trustees and bondholders were made by the thousands. With every false purchase came a false promise that led to deepening the debt of the railroad. The total debt, bonded and floating, amounted to nearly 11 million dollars. ","Unable to deal with the mounting debt, trustees called a meeting to discuss the future of the Alabama and Chattanooga railroad. Visibly shaken and incredibly nervous, the trustees conducted the meeting. Unbeknownst to them, this meeting would be their last. The content of the meeting foreshadowed the company's subsequent foreclosure a year later. Demands for payments on improvements and to employs could not be met. After intense deliberation, the trustees were forced to succumb to the U.S Circuit Court of appeals order and foreclose on their endeavor in order reimburse the federal government.

The A&C railroad foreclosure initiated conversations about the greater role of the federal government in private endeavors that affected the public. Reconstruction was an effort to solidify the nation while acknowledging the identity of the South. At the time, southern politics supported a lack of federal involvement in local and state affairs.

Crop production that decreased during the Civil War, resumed as farmers returned from the battle fields to fields of their own. Many crops provided both sustenance and income for Alabamans. However, the flood of 1884 cut the cotton crop for the year by nearly forty thousand bales and set farmers back for the season. Due to minimal technology, only almanac's served as resources for predicting weather. To add insult to injury, a particular infestation of worms accompanied the flood of 1884, infiltrating cotton fields across Alabama making it virtually impossible to produce market-worthy cotton. State-wide production decreased by over five hundred thousand bales from 1860 to 1870. Cotton production bounced back, increasing 196 percent to 299, 814 pounds by 1880. The Great Flood of 1884 set all progress back. ","Called the Great Southern Staple, Cotton was king. Conventions, associations and research dedicated to cotton numbered well into the hundreds across the South. Cotton production was difficult; weather and infestations were often unpredictable. Furthermore, despite the benefits of regional fertility, soil razed during the Civil War had yet to recover in order to generate the nutrients appropriate for cotton growth.","Industrial changes and improvements lent themselves to the greater mission of Alabama but agriculture continued to serve the southern economy. Both the New York Times and Chicago Tribune ran the story about the cyclone and subsequent flooding in Alabama. Interest from the Tribune and Times on the consequences for cotton was a testament to the importance of the South's sustaining crop.

After docking, Cullmann found his way to Cincinnati, Ohio where we managed to reconnect with friends from the old country. Realizing his dream, a colony for immigrants specifically from his country, Cullmann ventured south in early 1871 in search of land and resources. ","Cullmann came to rest in Florence, Alabama where his efforts were assisted by Governor Robert M. Patton. Patton provided Cullmann with men and horses enough to explore the northern areas of Alabama. After a significant search, Cullmann found land, but lacked the money to acquire it. Cullmann mustered the courage to call on a railroad official for the outstanding funds. The official's aid enabled Cullmann to acquire several hundred thousand acres of land on which he would establish his colony. ","Cullmann's land extended from Decatur to Montgomery, 15 miles on each side of the railroad. In the days that followed, Cullmann scoured the property, documenting and observing the terrain in preparation for the arrival of immigrants. Despite advertising efforts in both Europe and America, people were slow to reply to Cullmann's colony. But on January 5, 1873, Cullman managed to interest 15 Cincinnati families to colonize in the South. In the months that followed, families filtered into what now stands as Cullman City in Cullman County, Alabama. Steady growth and immigration cause Cullman City to thrive on its diverse population. The city had physicians, ministers, and numerous persons of other trades. The city eventually elected its own officials and acknowledged itself as a reason for Alabama's growth. The addition of a hospital, public works, roadways and improvements on existing railroads increased the appeal of Cullman City, making it a popular destination for both immigrants and non-immigrants alike. Cities began to spring up on the outskirts of Cullman City, expanding its boarders.","The establishment of Cullman City was met with resistance. Cullmann's project was opposed by Alabama legislators and citizens alike who were uncertain as to the benefits of opening their southern, secluded state to immigrants. The price of the land he obtained for the venture was also in question. Skeptics wondered if Cullmann had acted legally when acquiring the land, but supporters of the effort appreciated Cullmann for his attempts to better northern Alabama. ","Cullman City provided a tangible example of entrepreneurship coupled with immigration. Nationally, the 1870s welcomed thousands of immigrants to the United States, but few ventured toward the South, preferring to settle in northern, more urban areas. Nevertheless, Americans were uncertain as to where immigrants would settle and what they would bring to the newly redefined nation. It is obvious that John G.

Clement D. Newman experienced this effect when he made this relocation in 1845. Newman recounts the social life of his new town to his father in a letter dated January 1, 1846. Though Newman surely liked the town of Norfolk, he admitted that the manners and customs are very different from what they are in New York State. The town's Christmas celebration greatly impressed Newman, as he enjoyed the fire crackers, presents, eggnog, turkey, whiskey, and Church services. In fact, Newman claimed that the town's Roman Catholic preacher was the most gifted orator that he had ever heard. He also noticed the importance of the naval shipping industry in Norfolk, which was one of the largest exporters on the East Coast. While talking to a sailor down at the port, Newman learned that orders had been given to outfit all of the vessels at the station in preparation for war. A Negro sale also took place shortly after Newman's arrival to Norfolk, an event which was an interesting sight to Northern eyes. At the sale, a number of slaves were sold, but the most intriguing sale to Newman was that of an old woman for a mere 39 dollars. Though the events and customs of his new home were a bit odd, Newman reiterated his content with Norfolk, and told his father that he was getting along very well in Virginia.","Newman's letter reveals a Northern perspective on Tidewater Virginia society. The festivities and Christmas celebrations that he attends shows the tight-knit community of Norfolk, and the welcoming nature of the town. At no point does Newman feel threatened or unwelcome due to his Northern status; he had no negative words for the kindness of the townspeople. More importantly, Newman's letter reveals two of Norfolk's main economic strengths - the slave trade and naval yards. Since its founding, Norfolk had been a coveted naval outpost for the British and Americans. Situated with the Elizabeth and James Rivers to the south and west, the Chesapeake Bay to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Norfolk had sensational access to shipping and transportation lines. Norfolk's ports were essential to the Union's economy, and also played significant roles in the sea exploration. During the mid-nineteenth century, around the time Newman lived in Norfolk, Wilkes' expedition to Antarctica and Perry's voyage to Japan originated from Norfolk's Gosport Shipyard. Newman also alluded to preparation for the upcoming Mexican-American War, a war in which ships from Norfolk would be employed.","The slave sale that Newman saw represents another facet of Norfolk's economy. Norfolk was one of the major slave centers on the eastern seaboard. From there, slaves were sent down to the slave markets of the Deep South. The slaves from Norfolk were marched overland by chains, shipped around the coast by boat, or taken down the Mississippi River on steamboats. Norfolk's status as a slave sale headquarters was essential to its prosperity and development throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.","Newman's letter highlights the cultural shock that a Northerner would experience after moving to the South, and touches on small events that reveal Norfolk's economic importance to the nation."],"display_date":"January 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-01","locations":[{"id":14407,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2475,"title":"The Need for Railroads in Norfolk\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Railroads were an essential component to economic growth and stability during the mid-nineteenth century. One letter, written by An Eastern Virginian to <em>The Lynchburg Virginian</em> in 1854, stressed the vital need to fix the railways running between Norfolk and the Valley of Ohio. Though transporting goods to the Valley of Ohio was possible, the route was extremely difficult due to the railway's lack of gauge uniformity. Norfolk's neglect to correct this problem greatly diminished its export potential. The current railway route was divided into five separate sections that totaled 520 miles. Very inefficient when hauling large loads, the divided railway needed to be unified. An Eastern Virginian was convinced that the commercial prosperity of the entire state hinged on this railroad. Since Virginia was experiencing an economic slump, the state's revival rested on the shoulders of the Norfolk line. Due to the Norfolk railways' present state, Baltimore and the North were shipping all of the goods to the West. An Eastern Virginian found this despicable and intolerable. If gauge uniformity were achieved, economic prosperity could be shifted back to Norfolk and Virginia. The Eastern Virginian even set out future plans to connect Norfolk's rail system to St. Louis, Louisville, and Memphis. Furthermore, the Eastern Virginian even discussed the advantages of the railway as a great military road, as it would create a direct route through the heart of the Union to the West."," The improvement of Norfolk's and Virginia's rail systems was a necessity to help boost the lagging economy. Inferior to other Northern and Western railway systems, the Norfolk line and many other Southern railways were unable to transport goods at a profitable level. The problem stemmed from the economic depressions that hit the nation. The depression of 1839 and the crop shortages of 1846, 1847, 1850, and 1851 greatly affected the South's agricultural output. Since the Southern economy depended on agricultural sales, the shortages hit the South much harder than the industrially dependent North. During these hard times, as the other railways grew and improved, Southern railways remained stagnant. Another problem that slowed Southern railway development was a lack of engineers. Engineers were scarce during wartime, as the Union shipped them to aid in the Mexican-American War. By the time they were released, the South was still in economic depression, and was unable to find the capital for railways. Meanwhile, the North and West had high-capital projects waiting to be constructed, and thus hired the engineers. When the South came out of its depression, it was essentially a decade behind the North technologically. This further hurt the railways' development, as Southerners often built their railroads with glaring technical flaws (such as Norfolk's gauge problem). The need to improve Southern railways was a significant task during the mid-nineteenth century. The South's inefficient rail system, caused by the effects of economic depression, hindered the development of Southern trade."],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2477,"title":"Norfolk&#39;s New Water System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-01-01","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1856, the city of Norfolk, Virginia asked Wade Burnett, a civil engineer, to construct a plan that would improve the city's water supply system. In his report, Burnett noted the improvements that an efficient water system could have in the community. The townspeople of Norfolk would benefit in many aspects of life- domestic use, manufactures, extinguishment of fires, shipping, public baths, public fountains, street cleaning, and sewage. Burnett stressed the health and safety benefits of the new water system, as an abundant supply of clean water would not only aid in the prevention of fires, but also dramatically improve the overall health of the city and its citizens. Burnett divided his plan into five categories: the Receiving Reservoir, the Engines and Engine house, the Distributing Reservoir, the Principal Main, and Distribution. The town would use the dam at Deep Creek as their water supply, the same source that the Dismal Swamp Canal Company used. Next, Norfolk's government needed to buy a new pumping engine for fire prevention. Burnett advised that the town buy two or three Worthington Patent Engines, as it was the same model that the city of Savannah used. The Distributing Reservoir would be an iron tank with the ability to hold 250 thousand gallons of water. Burnett suggested that the Principal Main Line run from the Engine House into Main Street, and be linked to 125 fire hydrants. Burnett estimated that the city could finish this extensive 364 thousand dollar project in a year."," Burnett's proposal represented an effort for civic improvement that was characteristic of many cities in the South during the mid-nineteenth century. As Southern economic hubs, such as Norfolk, looked to increase their economic output, local governments began to focus on improving the urban environment of their cities. City officials wanted their communities to appeal to prospective business partners. With epidemic being closely related to a city's cleanliness, people looking to trade avoided cities that had a fertile environment for disease. If disease broke out, such as Norfolk's yellow fever epidemic just two years earlier, the flow of goods and agriculture would stop. Therefore, cities in the South created subsidiaries for the improvement of roads, fire protection, lighting, and water supply in order to prevent an outbreak of disease. It is important to note that these measures were mostly run for the economic interests of the businessmen and city officials, not for the health and well being of the people. Though the community definitely benefited from these improvements, the true purpose, driven by powerful business leaders, was to give their city better economic opportunity.

A yellow fever epidemic that spread throughout Eastern Virginia's Tidewater Region during 1855 did just that. Laura Reed, a resident of Portsmouth, Virginia, recounted the state of the town during the epidemic to her sister, Ellen Reed of Hampton, Virginia, in a letter on September 1, 1855. Laura described the damage to the community's population as severe, though the local physicians believed that the epidemic would be over soon. The doctors' opinion was that the epidemic would begin to decline after sixty days of exposure in the community. Since the fever had reached Portsmouth about a week after the Fourth of July, the town was optimistic for a return to good health. Laura noted that there had been a steady decrease in the amount of deaths last night, as only nine people had perished. Though Laura's immediate neighbors were now beginning to show an early sign of the fever, the black vomit, she reiterated to Ellen that she felt quite safe. Laura and her mother, with whom she lived with in Portsmouth, kept the house well ventilated and fumigated with chloride of lime and guano, safety measures that had been working well to ward off the fever. Though Laura and her mother may have avoided an infection, the yellow fever had severely crippled Portsmouth and the surrounding region.","Epidemics ravaged the Southern states during the mid-nineteenth century. The hot, humid summers that were characteristic of the South provided the perfect environment for the contraction and spread of infectious disease. Unfortunately, most Southern cities lacked the proper safety precautions and policies to effectively prevent and contain these deadly epidemics. The reason for this lack of preparation was economic. Since businessmen often ran most communities and cities during the time, they were hesitant to spend their money on costly town improvements. Officials believed the improvements were not worth the money that they cost. Though the need for these safety measures was quite obvious, funding for such projects was usually inadequate.","The economic effects of this yellow fever epidemic were catastrophic on the Tidewater economy, especially in the area's economic hub, Norfolk. The fear that the yellow fever caused was significant. This fear was warranted, as ten percent of the Norfolk population would be killed from the yellow fever. Due to the epidemic, Baltimore, New York, and the cities of Virginia placed a four month trade interdict on goods from Norfolk, a ban that deprived the Norfolk economy of an estimated five million dollars in trade profits. This paranoia effected more than just the economy, as many frightened Virginians rallied to get the state legislature in Richmond moved to a safer location. The city of Norfolk, and all of the surrounding Tidewater communities that depended on it, would need about five years to recover from their damaged economy and image."],"display_date":"September 1, 1855 - December 31, 1860","search_date":"1858-05-02","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2486,"title":"The Exodus from Suffolk\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-02","end_date":"1855-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the mid-nineteenth century, adventurers seeking gold and quick riches hurried to the West as fast as they could. This excitement was not lost on the people of Suffolk, Virginia, as many citizens joined this exodus to the new frontier. An article in <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em> noted the departure of Suffolk citizens, and publicized the author's disdain for their departure. The article, printed on January 2, 1849, referred to the Gold Rush as the Yellow or the California Fever, and contended that Suffolk was just as victimized by this epidemic as any other city in the nation. If myths of gold fields and instant wealth were not persistent enough, the War Department in Suffolk had several specimens of gold ore, some as large as two ounces, on display to further feed the frenzy. The author questioned whether any permanent benefit from this California rush would materialize, as the chances of unearthing a substantial amount of gold were slim to none. Furthermore, the effects of these citizens' departure affected the local Suffolk economy. Due to the decrease in work force, farms and workshops in the Suffolk area became deserted. On a broader scale, the author worried that this national craze was diverting the nation's attention from developing a solid economic base. The Yellow was not only weakening the stability of Suffolk, but also drying up the true springs of national prosperity.","The Gold Rush created a wild exodus of people to the frontier. By the end of 1849, nearly 80,000 settlers had arrived in California seeking opportunity. The migration of people from Virginia, and other Southern states, played a significant role in the development of new territories in the West. The arrival of these journeymen helped develop the area's resources, infuse more wealth into the territories, and add political importance to the West. The Gold Rush was not the only factor that drew Southerners to the new frontier; the feuding in Bleeding Kansas during the 1850's provoked Virginia and North Carolina to send 4, 721 people to help support slave interests. However, the West was not the only region affected by this migration. With everybody traveling to the frontier, there was nothing to offset the population losses that hit Virginia. Therefore, the Old Dominion faced a decrease in the national House of Representatives and in the Electoral College, weakening its national power. Though the West presented economic opportunity to many people in the Union, the craze to migrate west had a negative effect on the economies of local communities and the political power of Virginia.

An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was excessive amounts of laudanum in their stomachs. The town was outraged and astonished. Who would commit such a heinous crime? The members of the community greatly respected the Braden family, and mourned their loss. A carpenter who was in the house that morning remembered seeing a seamstress, Mrs. Gray, preparing coffee for the family. After the carpenter left the house, he saw Mrs. Gray hurriedly walking down the street. Later that day, the neighbor found the bodies. The town formed search parties, and soon they found a frail, terrified woman in the woods surrounding town. Portsmouth had found its murderer.","Mrs. Gray was actually Maria Black Thorn, a woman who led a very troubled past. Maria was traveling on a boat to New York City when it stopped for repairs in Portsmouth. In ill health and lacking money, Thorn stayed in Portsmouth, and found a job working for the Braden family. During the trial, Thorn revealed that the Bradens' deaths had been unintentional. The night before the family was found dead, she had stolen 500 dollars from the house. With this money, Thorn intended to leave Portsmouth and make her way to New York City. Thorn deposited laudanum in the coffee to put the family to sleep during her getaway, not kill them. Nonetheless, the jury of Portsmouth sentenced Thorn to death. Thorn became very ill after the trial, and stayed in her prison cell for months awaiting her execution. The town never received a chance to hang Maria Black Thorn though, as a guard found her dead in her prison cell on March 20, 1855. She had committed suicide.","Bizarre murders like the Thorn case rattled the security of a community. The fear and confusion that arose left the town in an unsettled state. People grew suspicious of each other, and the citizens lost their mutual trust. Thorn's trial reveals the necessary actions taken by a local court to stabilize the community after such an event. Ill and poor, Thorn had no intentions of murdering the family. Nonetheless, the court gave the only sentence that could possibly compensate for the death of Portsmouth citizens-death. Though Thorn was a woman, she was an outsider to the community, and the court's objective was to restore peace and trust within the town. Therefore, no lenience was shown. ","The Thorn case correlates to a situation that Rothman examines in Notorious in the Neighborhood. In the case of Peggy, a sexually abused slave who was an accomplice in her master's murder, similarities arise between the two situations. Constantly raped by her master, Peggy lived a harsh life, and probably deserved to murder her master. However, the testimonies of the involved slaves leave uncertainty surrounding Peggy's role in the murder. Similar to the Thorn case, doubt surrounds the motive of the murder, and the woman's lifestyle is almost unbearable. After her sentencing, many citizens petitioned for her acquittal, citing her living condition and uncertain role in her master's death. Nonetheless, the court of New Kent County, Virginia hung Peggy to restore harmony to the town. Both cases reveal a local court's social duty to re-establish order in the community. In tight-knit communities, it was the court's role to maintain justice and stability within society. Violent acts of crime weakened people's feeling of security, and increased their suspicions of outsiders. In Thorn's case, the people of Portsmouth were more fearful of outsiders to their community; in Peggy's, her master's murder brought slave owners' fears of slave retaliation to reality. Citizens had sympathy for both women, but the death sentence was the only option-lenience was not. Though the accused were both women, the community took precedence.

In Louisiana these thoughts were especially common in rural parishes. Therefore it was not entirely uncommon for southern men to sign on to fight for the Union.

For example, there was a law that stated that for each twenty slaves a man owned one man from his home would be excused from fighting. Rich men were also able to buy others to substitute their spot in the troops. There were also heavy taxes on farms, even on farmers who had little to spare. As the war raged on it was very common for Confederate soldiers to simply desert from the army. Some were caught in the process, but most were able to escape.

The Board determined that by enlarging the dimensions of the Dismal Swamp Canal, it could become practicable for sloop navigation, and in so doing, might be rendered imminently useful as an auxiliary defense.  It became necessary to establish a line of inland navigation from Norfolk to Beaufort, in North Carolina including the Dismal Swamp...connect Roanoke, Pamptico, and Neuse Rivers by a canal passing through Plymouth Washington and New Bern and to extend it from New Bern to Beaufort, opening a new passage from Albemarle sound to the ocean.

Since the construction of Bald Head's first lighthouse, there had been a drastic change in the Cape Fear River channel.  Threatened by shorefront erosion, the original lighthouse appeared as if it would topple over.  Its light could no longer be seen by most traveling vessels.  In addition to a new lighthouse, proposals for Bald Head incorporated a dwelling house as well.  To insure greater durability, proposals required, the light house to be of hard brick, the form octagon, the foundation to be of stone, and laid as deep as may be requisite to make the fabric perfectly secure, and to be carried up five feet above the surface of the earth.","Lighthouses enjoyed an almost three hundred year era of guiding ships safely along their seafaring voyages.  Their purpose was to assist the passing ships in plotting their locations and to warn them of impending danger.  The North Carolina coastline was especially dangerous to navigate, as it was low and flat whereas other coastlines formed naturally deep ports.  The geography of the coast was also devoid of distinguishing landmarks or permanent highlands, making it difficult for crews to determine exactly where they were.  Because of North Carolina's treacherous coastline, there had been the need to build lighthouses so as to warn sailors of impending danger as they neared the North Carolina Outer Banks. ","Lighthouse expert David Stick outlines Bald Head's rebirth.  Selected as the site of the first North Carolina lighthouse, the original Bald Head lighthouse was located on the southeast side of the mouth of the Cape Fear River.  However, as new lighthouses began to be built, inadequacies at Bald Head became apparent.

Having previously come from a rural town, John Wise was mocked by his schoolmates for being a provincial bumpkin.  However, most of the abuse from his fellow students was due to his father's political persuasion as a Democrat.  In one particular passage of his writing, he recounted how his days as a schoolboy in Richmond were comprised of deflecting taunts, and fighting off bullying from the sons of Whig and Know-Nothing citizens who were instilled with a hatred of all things Democrat.

The Tennessee Historical Society hoped  that the exposition would show the future of the South and respect or a proud military history.  Local businesses shut down as a military and civic parade marched down the street.   The most popular exhibit was an exotic Egyptian mummy display and a collection of other antiquities which furthered the description of Nashville as The Athens of the South.  Despite this show of progress and innovations, the conception of The New South was mired in the hypocrisy of lynching.        Southern Industrial Expositions  were intended to show a balance between innovation and a reverence for traditional values.  Former editor of The Atlanta Constitution, Henry Grady, illustrated the balance between the two seemingly contradictory values.  He believed that the South could embrace industry while being proud of its military and agricultural history.  He acknowledged that decades of slavery prevented southern industry from developing.  He and many other southerners believed that racial problems improved since emancipation. The goal was to portray a stable environment that would attract northern investors to capitalize to the large labor force in the South.   The reality was that beneath the pomp and circumstance of the military and industrial parades was the same underlying problem of terrible race relations of the slave South.       Textile mills, sawmills, cotton processing, and other industries developed faster than the North, but the region remained predominately agricultural in nature.   Despite new innovations, southern cities were nowhere near as technological as northern cities.  Nashville was one of the first southern cities to have streetlights by 1880. Most of the area around Nashville remained reliant on the typical  commodities of the Old South  such as cotton and tobacco.  New industrial farming technology actually hurt the cotton economy by creating overproduction and, consequently, lower cotton prices.  Despite industrial expositions in Nashville proclaiming change in the South, the region was still plagued by the same racism and agricultural economy of the Old South.  The Steubenville Daily Herald from Ohio highlighted the contradiction that lynching represented in the  plan for the New South.  In the ideology of the lost cause, southerners fantasized that the Confederacy failed because they lacked the industrial capabilities of the north.   The acceptance of widespread segregation and violence beginning in the early 1870s showed that white southerners were not interested in changing every aspect of the  South."],"display_date":"September 10, 1874","search_date":"1874-09-10","locations":[{"id":12005,"lat":35.1672648222,"lng":-86.1060239614,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2577,"title":"The Elite South are Immune\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-09-07","end_date":"1832-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A cholera epidemic struck the United States in 1834, affecting southerners in every social standing. However; elitism and negative racial attitudes ultimately influenced perceptions about the transmission of the disease. Todd Savitt, a historian specializing in nineteenth-century medicine and disease stated that white Virginians often related high morals, clean living and orthodoxy to immunity during the cholera epidemics. White paupers, free blacks, and slaves because of their sinful ways, degraded condition, and filthy habits were viewed as the prime targets for cholera. Whites, who may have revealed symptoms of Cholera, were often diagnosed with diarrhea, dysentery, or fever rather than to be diagnosed with the poor man's disease. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported the first case of malignant cholera in Richmond, it was not surprising to Virginians that the first victim was a slave boy. The master of the young boy wrote an urgent letter to the Richmond Department of Health describing symptoms of cholera and the condition of his dying slave. The young boy, an eleven year old subject to fits of diarrhea and incredibly dehydrated died a few hours later in the tobacco factory of his master. The young boy exhibited the principle symptoms of cholera: bouts of profuse diarrhea. The Richmond Board of Health traced the cause of cholera to the young boy's consumption of contaminated pears. The Richmond Board of Health would later publish statements connecting the supposedly crude eating habits of the underclass to cholera. "," Location rather than race and class attributed to the prevalence of cholera among free blacks, slaves, and lower class whites. According to Dhiman Barua and William Greenough, medical professors specializing in cholera epidemics, the cholera bacterium thrives in water ecosystems and transmits through the ingestion of water or food contaminated by fecal mater. Those living close to cities express high rates of vulnerability to the disease.  Transmission rates of cholera in the nineteenth-century South rose because of unsanitary conditions in newly developing cities. In Richmond, the James River and the Kanawha Canal provided opportunities for cholera to spread through low income homes and slave quarters. Free blacks, urban slaves and lower class whites throughout the South faced increased susceptibility to cholera that was attributed to densely populated housing, inefficient waste management systems and close proximity to local rivers, rather than race and class."],"display_date":"September 7, 1832","search_date":"1832-09-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2588,"title":"Southern Diseases and Public Health\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-04-10","end_date":"1868-04-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["E.J.

The abundance of disease contributed greatly to a negative stereotype of the entire region. Yellow fever and malaria were the two most terrifying diseases that were prone to the South. During the Civil War, more Americans died of disease than from wounds received in battle. Though this was common for wars before the twentieth century, the sheer number of sick soldiers bears some relation to the diseases prevalent in the South. Union soldiers suffered particularly from malaria because they had no immunity to it. After the Civil War, diseases like yellow fever and malaria made the health situation worse. The overwhelming poverty in the states of the former Confederacy brought about a spike in disease.

In the early 1860s, tracks exceeded 30,000 miles in length. The North was certainly far more connected than the South, simply because they were more industrialized and had the money to do so. Often in the South, the majority of money spent was for land purchases or slaves. The railroads of the South were not evenly dispersed. Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia often supported the development of the railroad while other Gulf states were more in favor of transportation via waterways to ship their products to seaports. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of the Antebellum South</em>, on the eve of the Civil War, Southern Atlantic coast states railway mileage was in excess of 5,000 miles while larger states such as Louisiana Mississippi, and Alabama had less the 1,800 miles of track. Tracks were often dead ends, leading from a plantation to a waterway and nowhere else. Similarly the railroads in Texas and Arkansas were equally as sparse. Tennessee and Kentucky were far advanced in comparison having strategically placed 1,300 miles by 1860. ","There was no uniform plan for railroad development at this time; however, both lines did met in Richmond, which provided the only direct line to the nation's capital in Washington, DC. The first railroad on the Eastern Shore was an infamous tease. There were parties where guns and bells rang and flags waved in celebration of the passage of a bill in the legislature that allowed for its creation. However, because of a financial depression, no tracks were laid, only some preliminary surveying done. Twenty-five years later, the first actual railroad emerged, owned by a company named the Eastern Shore Railroad Company. Delaware's railroad ended at the state line and Marylanders organized its extension to the town now known as Crisfield. (John W. Crisfield of Princess Anne County was the lawyer and Congressional associate of Abraham Lincoln, of whom the town was named.)","Two years later, and on the brink of the Civil War, the railway finally was completed from Delmar to Salisbury. A celebration was in order; for twenty-five cents, passengers could travel on a three and one half mile trek aboard the small steam locomotive. Many on the Eastern Shore had never seen such a sight in their lives. There was fear, excitement, and hope in the air. People traveled from miles around to join in the celebration of the opening of the railroad on July 4, 1860. ","After the celebrations, the train began to run on a regular schedule. The extension of the railroad through the Eastern Shore created many opportunities for entrepreneurs. Hotels were established for guests to stay after arriving from their journey on the train and trade became far more accessible for the watermen and farmers of the area. After the war ended, the railroad was extended further southward to include Princess Anne and Cape Charles Counties. Marylanders needed and wanted a direct line from northern manufacturing cities for expansion to more southern markets.  The railroad allowed for dramatic improvements in trade and communication. Even so, there were often problems in connecting networks. Differences in track width, lack of maintenance, and weak bridging technology all caused major slow downs. Inefficient braking prohibited trains from exceeding more than twenty-five miles an hour without risking derailment. Even with the twenty-five mile per hour limitations, railroads still drastically sped up the economy of the South. Technologically, railways were still extremely primitive, but they were a modern marvel of that generation.

Boynton in a hot air balloon above the clouds. The bride was an orphan, born in Northampton County, Virginia, and adopted by Mrs. J.L. West of St. Louis as an infant. With over 6,000 spectators present, the bridal party left the Fifth Avenue Hotel for Central Park. His sister and the owner of the balloon accompanied the young bride and her fiance for the ceremony. They floated away from the Park, exchanging vows and signing the marriage contract while ballooning through the sky. Such a fairy tale wedding made reality for a young girl who once had no hopes for such a comfortable future. Social status was determined in large part by family and as an orphan she was left in the cold. She had little hope for education, medical care, and would have most likely been forced to work in a factory to support herself even as a teen. She was so lucky to avoid all of that. ","During the years preceding the war, slavery continued to fade away and forced by low profitability of small scale farming, many men were forced to find other means of work. Often these farmers could not produce enough substantial crops to feed their families, much less enough to commercially sell at market. Livestock also required larger treks of land to sustain profitability. Fishing and hunting were often alternate ways that the poor obtained food. Economic expansion created a great struggle between the classes. As lumbering, steel, and iron industries emerged, employers began to look past racial lines, hiring whites and blacks as equals. Many men who saw their skin color as the only valuable asset they possessed were stripped of their pride when forced to work side by side with newly freed African Americans. ","Occupation, residence, religious affiliation, and such too often determined much of one's societal value. The poor worked for minimal wages while the socially elite could afford luxuries such as Mary West's wedding dress made of the richest of poplin, trimmed with rich velvet, with a silk hat and gloves to match. Wealthy southern aristocracy shared many of the same privileges as those of the north, but often gaining their wealth by use of slaves. Many owned plantations, but other chose to invest in industrial endeavors. The Duke and Winston families prospered from the tobacco market in North Carolina and Mary Ann Todd, wife of Abraham Lincoln was from a Kentucky family that made its money from banking. Southern wealth was no longer the result of solely slave labor.","Mary West's marriage to Dr. John Boynton was certainly one of exceptional status. They were both highly educated. She attended Monticello Seminary in Illinois and was quite talented in music and drawing. John graduated from a medical institution and was well known for his lectures in geology. He also at one time held government office. Their wedding was elegant and very original even by today's standards. Her dress was rose in color and the hot air balloon was adorned with lace curtains and tassels in the colors of the American flag. After landing at sunset, they took a train back to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to share their first night as husband and wife. Mary West was fortunately raised by a loving mother that was more than able to give her all the comforts that she would have never experienced as an orphan on the eastern shore of Virginia. While Mary West's economic prosperity did not make her happiness, it was far more promising than the life that she was born into.

The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

On January 11, 1868, HarpWeek published a two-picture political cartoon entitled The Pleasure of Tobacco. The first picture featured a young man in bed enjoying his pipe. The caption under the drawing said, To which young and promising Tom Smudger abandons himself. He wasteth the midnight oil. Quantities of Killikinick, and himself simultaneously. However, the second picture is a casket covered in a sheet with a pipe on top. The casket is resting in the grass of the graveyard; captioned Smudge becomes a martyr to his Love, and the Object of the Devotion is buried with him. This cartoon warned against the fatal consequences of smoking tobacco. "," George William Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly, used to smoke himself but stopped in the 50s. In 1867, he submitted his own editorial to warn his readers of the negative effects of tobacco use on their health. He said that tobacco contained poisons that were harmful to our bodies and that if we quit, we will soon feel in better health. The deadly politics of tobacco was certainly a struggle- on one hand it was the second most profitable cash crop in the South, but on the other, people were dying from it as well. "," HarpWeek published many advertisements for tobacco products as well as those for quit and get fit campaigns. But in the man while people die prematurely of palsy of the heart, cancerous stomachs, and diseased lungs from its excessive use; and they will continue to do so if half the world is depopulated by this vegetable tyrant. Lack of scientific evidence regarding tobacco's harmful effects caused much controversy over the topic. Some claimed that everything in moderation was fine, including tobacco use and that it in no way could be linked to disease. "," Even the last great tax on the luxury of cigars and pigtail, by Congress, which seemed likely to limit its consumption, has had no more effect than beating an elephant with a feather. Efforts were made by governments across the country to tax tobacco more heavily in hopes to reduce its widespread usage; however, it's use continued to only expand. Some saw tobacco as a drug, a killer, and others as just something to do to pass the time. Even a hundred years before Surgeon General warnings, we already had begun to understand tobacco's effects. "," Tobacco was more prevalently grown during the colonial period, than during the years after the Civil War, but it certainly had not disappeared from the scene. Seventy-five percent of cotton came from plantations along with other crops such as sugar, rice and tobacco. Richmond was one of the largest producers of tobacco in the world during this time. The slave trade experienced increased activity and more profitability than any other time thus far and therefore provided even more labor for fieldwork. The new railroads connecting the rest of the country also allowed tobacco to be traded and sold great distances. Tobacco remained a very important cash crop in North Carolina and Kentucky. Meanwhile plantations in Virginia and Maryland were not so fortunate; they suffered from depleted soil and decreasing profits. "," Tobacco was an extremely soil depleting crop. While plantations thrived, small farmers were hard pressed for money for such large-scale productions. They would often plant small plots of lower quality tobacco and rotate with other crops like sweet potatoes and cowpeas to allow the soils to recoup. These small farmers rarely could afford to own slaves because prices had sky rocketed in upwards of 2,000 a slave. In order for plantations to succeed, planters not only had to have plenty of acreage but enough cheap labor to work it. Needless to say, the plantation economy was not the norm for most southern whites but was responsible for the production of the majority of tobacco for the entire nation. "," The years preceding the war, cigarettes became the most popular form of tobacco- both hand rolled and machine rolled. The tobacco industry continued to boom from Virginia all the way down to Georgia. Durham and Winston-Salem North Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky, and Richmond, Virginia became major centers for cigarette production and brought wealth to the areas. The invention of the cigarette rolling-machine and the manufacture of cigarettes so close to home increased the demand for the plant immensely. Annual national per capita consumption rose from 1.5 pounds in 1860 to 5.5 pounds in 1900, a 267 percent rise. "," Tobacco never lost its place in society nor the economy as both a source of pleasure and of pain. Even a hundred years later, we are still battling its cancerous effects on our nation.

He wrote about how unimpressive Atlanta was and stated that he could not gather a single item of interest about the city to write about. He was able to see a show while in the city. He observed that people in Atlanta responded well to the play because the theater was full and there were many demands for an encore presentation. He noted that the cotton and guano markets were not doing well there due to the overuse of fertilizer. The presence of fertilizer being sold indicated that farmers were trying harder to produce the cash crops even though the markets were bad. He repeated information from an article from New Orleans in Atlanta's newspaper saying that people were encouraged not to buy goods like sugar and molasses from the North because of additional shipping costs. Overall, he was not impressed by the city of Atlanta.","Urbanization and industrialization were important ideals of the New South after the Civil War in order to make their region more appealing to the North according to Jeanette Keith. Large urban centers would make the south more appealing for Northern investors, and then the economy of the South and the nation would improve. This process was most often accomplished by bringing railroads into the area. According to James McPherson, railroads allowed for Southerners to transform this kingdom from open-range grazing and the long cattle drive to...more scientific methods of livestock agriculture. Farmers made products like cotton or other crops and shipped them to other parts of the country with the availability of railroads. The railroads also allowed for products to be brought into urban centers from other places, even from the North. McPherson noted that shipping could be costly, however, in places with access to only one railway line because the owner had a monopoly on the shipping. Thus, it would have been likely that shipping costs were high for goods from New Orleans as the reporter warned people of Atlanta. The historian Lewis Nicholas Wynne wrote that the railroads and the increasing commercial centers resulting from the railway system were created with the intention of making the South a part of the national economy. Although the Southern cities that were created allowed the people more independence with increased wealth, Wynne argues that the Southern cities were looking to be incorporated into the nation as a whole.

Farmers are so crippled that they cannot buy as much as usual of the fertilizers made of the phosphate 'rock,' which is one of the chief products of South Carolina . . . War, fire, cyclones and earthquake have terribly tried the birthplace of the Rebellion. Yet he also expresses optimism that the city's natural harbor will allow it to recover from this series of calamities."," The writer also comments on the state of religion in the city.

He describes an Episcopal minister who had battled civic corruption for months in the form of a saloon across the street that the city refused to close on the Sunday. After months of wrangling, the saloon was destroyed by a cyclone, which the writer sees as a sign of emerging righteousness in the city, even though gambling was still a major issue. Still, he is encouraged by the efforts local ministers are taking to reform their city."," This episode shows the paternal attitude that the North had towards the South even three decades after the Civil War. During Reconstruction (1865-1876) Northern Republicans dominated national politics by waving the bloody shirt at voters to remind them of the horror Southerners had unleashed on the nation. Additionally, Southern evangelicals remained hostile with their Northern counterparts over the issue of whether slavery and the war had been sinful. These debates helped foster a general view amongst the rest of the country that the South was backwards, unenlightened, and poor.

Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2740,"title":"Transportation Takes Over\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-07-14","end_date":"1878-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" It was the middle of October in Alexandria.

When Austin moved into an African American neighborhood, the white community in Knoxville ostracized her for her work and the area in which she lived. While the community did not object to educating African Americans, they believed that only a very destitute and lowly woman would fraternize with blacks. Initially, Austin worked under the Freedman's Bureau, but when the Bureau was dissolved, she financed the school with personal funds and donations from northern friends. When the school became overcrowded, she erected a large schoolhouse, which she donated to the city, requiring that it always be used to educate African American students. In 1881, Austin grew to believe that she needed to reform her curriculum, as she believed that teaching the arts and sciences left the black students idle, thriftless, and contemptuous of work. Thus, Austin began to declare that industrial training was the only practical education for African Americans, because African Americans could only find employment in the industrial sector. She established industrial training for her students in the departments of sewing, gardening, domestics, and carpentry, but she faced much opposition from the students' parents. The African American parents opposed their children studying different subjects than white children. Austin continued to teach the industrial classes, but split the school day into sections of traditional teachings and industrial teachings.","Austin faced much difficulty in her profession, as both whites and blacks snubbed her for work. Austin said that her greatest difficulty was the African American opposition to her work, but she continued to educate her students because of her strong belief in the importance of industrial education for African Americans. Austin argued that African Americans held a great disadvantage in professional studies, making it impossible for them to compete with white students and gain professional positions. She also argued that education in the arts and sciences lead black students to despise manual labor. Thus, she argued that African Americans needed industrial training to convince them that good, honest work was the only way to make them good citizens.

Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

Green knew that there was a future in the manufacturing of tobacco because he noticed the extensive amount of its consumption in the Confederate Army and among university students. Green focused on the manufacture of smoking tobacco by buying only the best grades of leaf. Later that year, a terrible incident turned out to be a blessing for him. The Confederate Army, while withdrawing through Durham, acquainted Green's tobacco with the Federals. The soldiers raided the factory, and Mr. Green assumed his business was ruined. However, they quickly acquired an appreciation for Spanish Flavored Durham Tobacco, when they smelled the smoke from Green's factory. Orders for Green's tobacco began to accrue, reviving both his business and the tobacco industry.

","Thus, when W.W.

They no longer feared negro rule; although black politician Hiram Revels stated, as reprinted by James Wilford Garner, that black voters during reconstruction had been used as mere tools to elect imprudent [and corrupt] men who called themselves Republicans, after 1890, they were no longer used at all. The chivalrous (?) [sic] white Democrats, according to the Cleveland Gazette, were therefore quite content.","Blacks of Mississippi and of the nation as a whole, however, were not pleased. The Atlantic Monthly noted by 1892 that The Fifteenth Amendment is disregarded [in Mississippi] where it is not nullified on the face of the state law. Reporting on this system of Jim Crow law, the Cleveland Gazette noted that the state of Mississippi was referred to by blacks as his Satanic Majesty's abiding place.","The problem, however, was that his Satanic Majesty sometimes left home. According to The Atlantic Monthly, candid Republicans at the North admit that domination by the ignorant blacks of the Gulf States is something to be dreaded. The suppression of the negro vote, wherever such a step is necessary to secure control of the government by the whites, is winked at, if not applauded. For some reason, be it simple racism or otherwise, the 1890 Mississippi constitution made sense to both Democrats and Republicans in both the South and the North. ","It made so much sense that the Justices of the United States Supreme Court, arguably some of the brightest legal minds of the time, supported it in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. As decided by the majority, Justice McKenna, a newly appointed Californian, opined that the statutes of the 1890 Mississippi constitution do not on their face discriminate between the races, and it has not been shown that their actual administration was evil; only that evil was possible under them.

She noted that the the gentlemen here are very polite and offer their horses and attendance to the women. However, Mary did not develop as fond of an opinion for Warrenton's women.  She expressed a specific dislike for a young woman by the name of Clara, whose social conduct she perceived as being distasteful, not only to herself but to others as well. At the first of two dances Mary attended while visiting, Clara, in one of her mischievous acts, put her head out an open window and mingled her 'snorings' with the sweet sounds of twilight dews.  To this, she said the gentlemen at the party burst out laughing and retreated to another room soon after.  As a visitor, she hoped that the gentlemen would not relate Clara's poor conduct to her. Mary concluded that Clara was as wild as an untamed deer and would hesitate at nothing for attention. Mary's account of Warrenton's social life only gives a glimpse at what Virginia social life was like at the time, though it does show that strict standards of social conduct were held.  While Mary's perceptions of Warrenton's men go along with the longstanding stereotype of the 'Virginia Gentlemen', her comments about Clara do not portray the stereotypical 'southern belle'. Clara irritated the social order, which is why Mary was so aware of her conduct and the men left the room shortly thereafter. In the antebellum South, women's actions were evaluated according to unique standards for each class, race, and gender.  Being that Mary and the others at the party were probably all within the same social class they would have had similar social standards.  When Clara did not adhere to these standards a conflict arose between her and the others, who were abiding to them. Clara's conduct could also be attributed to an unwillingness to conform to the rules of society, rather than a lack of social prowess.

After the Civil War, however, hunting decreased due to the urbanization of the South. Cities and towns were forming, and people were becoming more concentrated.

The Michigan fields are being heavily drawn upon, while the crop in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin is eminently encouraging, thus relieving fears of an ice shortage. This was especially good news for Mr. Beasly of Crystal Springs, Mississippi, who ten years earlier had build an ice-house in his town in order to supply his neighbors with ice. Beasly had recognized that the ice trade was not only extremely important to warmer climate areas, such as Mississippi and much of the South, but also could be very profitable.","By the 1800s, of ice harvesting had been around for centuries. According to world-renown ice-historian Mariana Gosnell, the so-called ice craze really started in Boston, when a man named Frederick Tudor, in the manner of a drug pusher, set out [in 1805] to create a taste for cold that would get customers hooked. Over the next few decades, Tudor and his foreman Nathaniel Wyeth succeeded in refining the mass cultivation and shipping processes of ice. Harvesting the ice from the fields, which were, in fact, very, very much more than frozen over lakes and ponds, became an intricate and precisely designed process. According to Gosnell, once a thick layer of ice formed over a field, it would be scraped clean, shined, and then carved into a checker pattern of large ice blocks with a single bladed plow. Using saws the blocks were cut free and then, using large pike poles, floated through a carved out channel to a collection area. Although one might think this process would eventually dry out the lake or pond being used, the process apparently removed from a 400-square-foot ice field...each year [an amount of water that is] less than the total amount of water that evaporates from the surface of the very same lake during a single hot summer day. Much less. ","Thus, despite the ice machine's invention as early as 1850 and emergence of ice plants, neither of which were in widespread usage (religious skepticism being one of the reasons against), Tudor and others that had caught on began to sell ice in massive quantities literally all over the world. In fact, according to Gosnell, for years [in the nineteenth century] ice was America's second-biggest crop by weight to be transported by trains and ships, with the first being cotton. Much of that weight undoubtedly went through the South, not only for the preservation of foods, but also because no self respecting Southerner would drink his bourbon warm or her Dom Perignon above the temperature of 38 degrees Farenheit, excepting, perhaps, Jill Masterson.","Upon receiving a shipment of ice, a southern city or town would store it in pits, caves, or trenches underground; in cavities mostly underground but with roofs, or entry structures above ground; or entirely above ground, in insulated houses. Judging by the blurb in the Crystal Springs Monitor, Mr. Beasly's construction was most likely the latter, and was probably painted white to reflect sunlight and to make it look more like an igloo. Between its outer and inner walls there would be some type of insulation, be it tanners, bark, charcoal, sawdust, hay, straw, [or] shavings. With the proper construction, Beasly would be able to maintain approximately 70-90 percent of his stored ice, sometimes for many years. Nevertheless, as the 1890 Clarion Ledger blurb referred to a possible ice famine in the summer, Beasly and the area his business supplied were most likely in want of a fresh shipment."],"display_date":"March 13, 1890 - December 31, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-06","locations":[{"id":7008,"lat":31.8692302776,"lng":-90.4488242966,"zoom":9,"place":"COPIAH, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2853,"title":"The Constant Threat of Disease\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-08-08","end_date":"1865-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 8, 1865, the Montgomery Advertiser warned its readers to look out for cholera.

White men, free black men and women, and enslaved men and women that [exercised] the privileges of free persons of color were taxed. Slaveholders paid taxes on their slaves as well. Higher taxes were levied on the more valuable slave demographics, especially men between the ages of sixteen and sixty. Free black men of the same working-age demographic had the highest tax of any of these groups. ","Notably, the two to four dollar tax on white men was listed as commutation for patrol and road and street duties, but no explanation was given for the levies on other populations. Taxes on slaveholdings resulted from their being legally considered property and taxed as such, analogous to the taxation of stock, inventory, horses and wagons also listed in the ordinance. The slave demographics were specified because age and gender affected a slave's economic value. ","Milledgeville taxation was a standard practice, and the 1843 levies increased because of an economic depression between 1841 and 1843. The taxation of free blacks, however, suggests that taxation was not solely for the purpose of funding municipal activities. Free blacks were not 'property,' and in Milledgeville they did not have to pay as many duties as white men, perhaps because they were not considered privy to the same civic securities. Instead, these taxes served a regulatory function; sometimes as high as sixteen dollars, the city's government hoped that even one or two taxes, if high enough, would force or persuade the free black population to leave the city. An additional fifty dollar tax was levied on free African Americans bold enough to move into the city. In spite of these efforts, Milledgeville remained a popular location for newly freed blacks who sought an alternative to the agricultural plantation work available in the country. ","This 'head tax' was commonly used in the South in order to discourage residency and, ideally, force free blacks to move from the area in question. In some areas of the South, the tax could also result in forced bondage; if taxes were not paid and there was no valuable property to be seized, the county could hire out the offender and force him or her to work off the debt, often for menial wages that resulted in months of involuntary labor. These taxes are only some of the ways in which free blacks were formally or informally discriminated against; between 1810 and 1822, free blacks were not allowed to live in Milledgeville at all, and even in 1843 they were required to present a certificate and bond for good behavior in addition to the tax. Such laws and regulations imply, as their creators intended, that living in the South as an African American involved very little freedom-even outside the legal bondage of slavery."],"display_date":1843,"search_date":"1843-07-02","locations":[{"id":1524,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2912,"title":"The Creation of the Savannah-Charleston Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-11-01","end_date":"1860-11-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the largest cities in the South, and conveniently located as a port city, Charleston in the 1850s was in a prime position to compete with Atlanta and New Orleans as the center for commerce in the South. And on November 1, 1860, Charleston celebrated a huge commercial step forward with the completion of the Savannah-Charleston railroad. The Charleston News and Courier commemorated the event with a lengthy history of the founding of Georgia and the opportunities the new line would bring economically for both states, boasting, For a new road it exhibits remarkable excellencies, and for its distance and cost it may challenge comparison with any road, European or American, within a maritime belt or region of country.","Accounts like this aside, historians vary between glass-half-full and glass-half-empty views of Charleston's status as an economic center in the antebellum South. Historian Ernest M. Lander, Jr., adopts the former view and concludes that Charleston was the industrial center of South Carolina in 1860, reaching a peak in 1856 of 3,000,000 in industrial production. However, his optimistic outlook is tempered in his conclusion, which notes that capital was limited, Northern competition fierce, and fires between 1856 and 1861 destroyed several promising factories. Historian Leonard Stavisky, in contrast, adopts an overall more pessimistic stance, contending that the plantation system, with its reliance on slave labor, kept an otherwise strategically positioned Charleston from achieving optimal levels of industrialization. ","Regardless of whether or not Charleston was one of the principal industrial centers in the South, this episode-and the reaction by the News and Courier-serves to illustrate the dominance of one particular economic variable in Southern life-trade-and the attempts of Southerners to use it to strengthen their economy. Indeed, as historian R.S. Cotterill notes, Time was when Charleston had been the social and industrial center of the south, but its glory had long since departed...Charleston was not ignorant of the cause of the decline, and set herself to the task of reviving her commerce by diverting western trade from New Orleans to herself. The surest way to divert western trade was to join the flurry of railroad construction occurring nationwide during the mid-nineteenth century."],"display_date":"November 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-11-01","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2971,"title":"Finding Utopia in Baldwin County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-11-01","end_date":"1894-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the summer of 1894 there was hope for a new way of life in the reconstruction of the South. E.B. Gaston took a group of people down to Baldwin County, Alabama on the Mobile Bay. A colony free from all forms of private monopoly, a colony where working people could come together to form a single-tax community was founded. Members of the Fairhope Industrial Association were all followers of economist Henry George, who asserted that the concentration of unearned wealth, or more specifically, wealth accumulated by rent tax, was the root cause of poverty. George's ideas were based on socialist tendencies but gained strength with the Populist movement in the United States. The members of the Fairhope Industrial Association could agree upon the ideals of a single-tax. They were searching to create a colony somewhere in the South, as most of the members were from the mid-western states such as Iowa and Illinois. The problem was finding a location where the Fairhope Single-Tax Colony could thrive. ","The Fairhope Committee presented their final findings after doing extensive field research in the Fairhope Courier, published out of Des Moines, Iowa, on August fifteenth of 1984. The publication's first episode examined potential spots to start a single tax colony, asking members of the Fairhope Industrial Association (assumed to be future colonists themselves) to vote. They visited locations in Tennessee, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama's Baldwin County and reviewed each extensively for their members to vote on. They reviewed agricultural conditions as well as social demographics. The report concluded the presence throughout the south of the black man is a serious drawback to its development, and furthermore suggested that the organization's members should favor lands with the least amount of Black people. They also reported on conditions such as soil type, climate, and geographic location. Three months later the colony was founded in Baldwin County Alabama, chosen for its favorable conditions described in the report: close proximity to the ocean and the bay as well as its fertile soil as well as its social demographics. It was named Fairhope. ","At the time movements with similar visions of social reform were taking place in the South. The Farmer's Alliance, one of the most important agricultural movements to ever come through Alabama, was gaining strength throughout the South, including places like Alabama and The Negro Alliance of farmers claimed 120,000 in 1891 and in 1889 claimed to have 50,000 members in Alabama alone. Eventually these groups became more and more divided on the issue of black membership and participation in politics. There is indication within the initial report published by the founders of Fairhope that they were aware of these issues in the South and wanted to avoid them by altogether avoiding black people in their community."],"display_date":"November 1894","search_date":"1894-11-15","locations":[{"id":17,"lat":30.2786488602,"lng":-87.5482936023,"zoom":9,"place":"BALDWIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2972,"title":"Prohibition and Organized Crime in the 19th Century South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-02-08","end_date":"1894-02-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As read in <em>The Sentinel</em>, a crowd of men had set up a whiskey store in the area of Glassy Mountain. With sufficient evidence to investigate the situation, Chief Constable Fant and his men made their way down to the anti-Prohibition display. In order to find the hidden whiskey, an undercover man had to buy the liquor; a man then went into the swamp to fetch the alcohol. According to the testimony found in the paper, A. Boyce Dean and the rest of the Constable's men saw the man coming into the swamp by way of his lantern; the man refused to halt and an exchange of gunshots occurred with no injuries reported. Next, as the men approached the house of A.C Gregory, a man, Crawford Ballew, approached them and refused to lower his guns. Mr. Massey fired and as the man?s wife cradled him in her arms, he died of gun wounds. The final verdict was that Ballew came to his death February 8, 1894 by gunshot wounds delivered by F. G. Massey and fired as a result of his defiance of the law officers."," Crawford Ballew, through his involvement in organized crime, met an early death as a result of the statewide support of Prohibition. As a state, South Carolina supported the regulation of liquor sales in response to the flux of alcoholism after the Civil War. According to Edward Ayers, liquor became an omnipresent beverage in the post-Reconstruction era as alcohol stores increased in number. Furthermore, the increase of liquor in society divided entire groups socially and politically. Developers pushed for an increased business pull for bars; they encouraged this as post-war economic growth. Also, whites, blacks, and women of both races found a large role in the prohibition movement as they rallied together to achieve the common goal of the prohibition of alcohol at bars and other similar stores. Janette Greenwood addresses the fact that, especially in the upper classes of both blacks and whites, race was discarded in order to push for social reform. It can be seen that Crawford Ballew?s demise can show how locally, Prohibition inspired an increase in organized crime in the Columbia area; however, across the south, the races and genders alike banded together to try and decrease the negative impact of liquor on their reparative society."],"display_date":"February 8, 1894","search_date":"1894-02-08","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3005,"title":"Sally Carter&#39;s Letter to her Mother\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-12-21","end_date":"1827-12-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late December of 1827, Sally Champs Carter, living in Richmond at the time, wrote home to her mother who was living in Albemarle County (approximately sixty miles west of Richmond).

There were parties almost every night of the week, and Sally greatly enjoyed attending these functions, particularly those of Dr. Brockenbrough, whom she described as delightful. Sally was yet to visit the theatre, which always seemed to conflict with those social events (she was planning to go soon though). Her favorite outfit to wear in social settings was a pure white dress, with pearl earrings and a necklace. Her Uncle John (perhaps her mother's brother) had complimented her on the simplicity and chasteness of the attire. At the end of her correspondence Sally sent her regards to her siblings, noted that she had enclosed money for her brother to by a hat (15) as she had an abundant supply of money, and wished her family well.

She seemed to truly enjoy her environment and her life in Richmond, as most in her luxurious position would have. Her Uncle John's comments on her attire show the typical appropriate dress for a young lady in antebellum Richmond, and her description of all the young men shows that she was treated like a true lady.

It lay just two miles north of the Cape Fear River, right on the Atlantic coast. Wilmington was an important port for the export of tar, turpentine, pitch, and lumber. The people of this small North Carolinian town were shrewd, hospitable, intelligent, and not to be beaten at driving a bargain by any Yankee. According to the soldier, we ate, drank and were merry...as in the days before the flood.","The flood that changed the character of Wilmington was the loss of control of the town to Union forces during the Civil War. By the time the Union focused its efforts on Wilmington, many of the other Southern ports had been seized by the Union. This made Wilmington a particularly vital possession for the Confederacy. After an unsuccessful first attempt to capture coastal control, the Union army was able to secure its position in Wilmington with a second endeavor in January of 1865. This victory was extremely monumental for the Northern cause because the control of Wilmington meant that the South had lost one of their very most important ports. Essentially, a lifeline to the South had been cut off, which weakened greatly its already dying cause. ","The capture of Wilmington was devastating not only for the Confederate military cause, but also for the people of the town. They had not seen any action in their town from the North for such a long time they thought they were safe from the perils of war. Residents had lapsed into a dream of security and thought the horrific day was far off. Historians Donald, Baker, and Holt seem to think that the fact that the Confederacy had kept Wilmington so long into the war was unexpected and its loss would be inevitable. However, given the attitude of its residents, not everybody expected the defeat, and it did come as a surprise to some. The loss of control changed the face of Wilmington. Families that had long been established in the area left for the interior of the state, and those that stayed did so because of limited option due to great loses in the war. The spirit and strength that Wilmington once boasted was now lost to a hopeless fear."],"display_date":"January 1, 1865 - January 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-15","locations":[{"id":9658,"lat":34.4008642849,"lng":-77.6110652671,"zoom":8,"place":"NEW HANOVER, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3034,"title":"Engines of Progress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-04-02","end_date":"1887-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Deep in the iron-rich north central region of Alabama, industry was booming.

Lewis Boyd, a black man, hopped up into the car to help unload the flour. As he removed the sacks of flour from the car, he happened to throw some of them to the ground. Conductor Shell reprimanded Boyd for his carelessness and Boyd took great offense. Boyd began to mutter and to curse the conductor out loud. Shell immediately responded, telling Boyd to stop. At this, Boyd snapped and he jumped onto Shell from the train car, hitting him on the head with a large stone. As Shell fell to the ground, Boyd hit him again and began kicking him. Other men working on the train rushed to the scene and restrained him. Boyd, seeing how badly Shell was hurt, ran for a nearby swampy area. However, the trainmen gave chase and brought him back. ","Meanwhile, word spread of what had happened. As Boyd was apprehended and brought back to town, a mob assembled, ready to kill Boyd for what he had done. The trainmen averted a lynching by hurrying Boyd off to the judge in Rogersville, who promptly threw Boyd in jail. At his trial, Boyd claimed Shell was the cause of the incident, that his actions were provoked. ","As railroads spread across the country in the period after the Civil War, they did more than just move goods for commerce from one place to another. They allowed people to move in, out, and around the south to a much greater degree than ever before. Thus, there were more unfamiliar faces- white and black- in towns where the railroad came. We don?t know if Boyd knew Shell personally, but it seems unlikely given the immediate hostility that arose between them on the day of the incident and given Boyd?s extreme actions. Historians have pointed out that these new social situations called for a more complex level of interaction than both white people and black people had been used to in the antebellum period. Indeed, race relations in these urban areas with people coming in and out were more impersonal and confrontational; thus a situation in which a railroad worker insulted a conductor and then attacked and severely injured him would be more likely to occur.

Though greatly appreciative of the 15 years he spent in Washington, Georgia, the congregation of St. Patrick's deeply regretted the transfer of Reverend J. M. O'Brien to his new parish in Augusta County. Thankfully, his former congregation will not be devoid of his influence despite his physical absence. The fruits of his work - evident in the boy's orphanage and the Academy of St. Joseph - stand as testaments to his good deeds while in Washington. To demonstrate their appreciation for O'Brien and his tremendous work and religious guidance, his congregation presented him with a very handsome watch one Wednesday evening. Furthermore, Reverend Bishop Becker, formerly of Savannah, the man who was assuming O'Brien's position at St. Patrick's, blessed and dedicated the new church bell in O'Brien's honor.","While at St. Patrick's, O'Brien was tireless in his efforts to raise the standard of devotion and outreach in the county. Almost immediately after his arrival in 1874, O'Brien assumed control over the recently relocated boy's orphanage. Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, his religious zeal and moral uprightness rejuvenated the conditions of Catholic faith in the county from its original dire depths. Apparently, O'Brien arrived at a time when Catholicity was at a low ebb and prejudice strong. Unfortunately, the bell dedicated in Father O'Brien's name no longer rings. Its station atop St. Patrick's has long ceased to exist. However, his efforts to raise moral and religious zeal among the Catholic population in Washington as well as his contributions to social outreach at the time remain greatly influential."," The reputation of the South as the Bible Belt, the strong hold of American evangelical Christianity, may have some merit. Though Father O'Brien attempted and, to some extent, succeeded in rejuvenating the Catholic population in Washington, the Protestant and evangelical Christian denominations were the salient religious hegemons in the region. How was this the case given the two and a half million Catholics who arrived in the States between 1880-1900? Where did they all go? The answer is certainly not to be found in the South. The mass influx of Catholic immigrants from Eastern Europe and Ireland and the subsequent nativist discrimination which accompanied the new citizens was one of many factors which explain the relatively small Catholic population in the South. Another possible explanation exists in southern Protestant culture which dominated the region and sanctified dominant political and social hierarchies. In spite of the simmering religious tensions just below the surface of Southern society, unprecedented community outreach and social awareness accompanied the growing importance of religion in the South. Projects like O'Brien's orphanage and academy for girls continued to flourish in the South and were incredibly important to the Progressive Era's manifold community projects and activism."],"display_date":"February 1889","search_date":"1889-02-14","locations":[{"id":2377,"lat":33.7814426129,"lng":-82.7442792235,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKES, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3187,"title":"Women Prepare for 1895 Atlanta Cotton Exposition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-09-18","end_date":"1895-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Porcelain panels of fruit, intricate paintings, exquisite displays of needlework, and skillfully-crafted carpentry. These elaborate and beautiful adornments awaited guests of the Women's Department at Atlanta's 1895 Cotton Exposition. Women's social clubs from the entirety of Georgia labored to make their display a true success. To do so, they culled art and handiwork from around the country, including particular contributions from Virginia, Illinois, and Maryland. Once acquired, women then categorized the work into different themed rooms like the Baltimore Room, the Lucy Cobb Room, the decorative art department, the library, and the Columbus Room. Though the addition of a Women's Department in Atlanta's Cotton States and International Convention may seem somewhat superfluous, women's social clubs throughout the region deemed it important to showcase women's progress throughout the South. Indeed, the display by the Women's Department was one of the hotspots of the Exposition featuring beautiful novelties in art and domestic living and hosting many visitors. Exhibits like that arranged by the Legion of Loyal Women drew particular attention. The Legion arranged 45 dolls to illustrate the American Patriotic salute, each wearing a small shield on which is the name of a state. Displays like this one spoke to expected social and domestic roles of Southern women as its image called forth the patriotism and republican ideals which mothers should imbue in their children.","Before television and radio, a city's means of attracting tourists was extremely limited; however, in the late nineteenth century, fairs and expositions rose to prominence as one manner of luring visitors. The 1895 Convention was one of three conventions hosted by Atlanta to demonstrate the city's recovery and economic promise following the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. In short, they helped establish Atlanta as the center of the New South. Displaying special buildings, collections of accomplishments by African Americans and women, and new technological marvels in the fields of transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, and the like, the Atlanta Exposition in 1895 sought to entice visitors and encourage new business development in the community. The Exposition also had an international element, for it hoped not only to foster trade between southern states and South American nations but also to show products and facilities of to the rest of the nation and to Europe. These objectives found expression in the official name of the event - the Cotton States and International Exposition. Though the focus of the event was on attracting visitors and potential investors, women played a large role in the Exposition, and the weight of representing an image of the classic South rested on their dainty shoulders. ","In flipping through the script of American political history, it is quite simple to assign men the role of title character and women the part of the ever-faithful sidekick. Naturally, there were those exceptional women in history who earned cameos in the public realm against the odds; however, the greatest proportion of women could be found backstage, arranging affairs like the Women's Department at the 1895 Exposition. Events like this were one of many manners in which women assumed a more social role at the end of the Nineteenth Century. They engaged in municipal housekeeping, reform, beautification projects, and to some extent even suffrage associations. Though the ideals of Republican Motherhood still somewhat constrained their liberties and social freedom, by the time of the Exposition in 1895, American women were progressively organizing and developing an identity as a whole.

These new railroad lines not only extended north to south, but also began to reach parts of the Deep South and the Midwest. In the thirty years following the Civil War, the South more than tripled its railroad mileage despite economic hardship because it faced the problem of needing to rebuild its communities without the proper resources or labor force available.

Despite having the first two batters record outs, the next two players managed to reach base, putting the centerfielder, Underwood, up to the plate. After two pitches, Underwood faced an 0-2 count, and the Monumental pitcher needed only one throw to end the game. Nevertheless, someone in the crowd yelled, hit a daisy, Underwood, and this he did, sending the next pitch deep into the outfield for a home run. The Norfolks scored three runs, winning the game in dramatic fashion for the hometown faithful, 5 to 2. ","The Yankee Army, during the Civil War, first brought baseball to the South by teaching Confederate troops the new game. After the war, localities throughout the South began to embrace the game, at first in the cities, then by the 1880's and 1890's nearly every town had a team. This development occurred amidst a Southern embrace, in the late nineteenth century, of all kinds of sports; southerners of every class, race, and gender eagerly embraced sports and its trappings. Though the North appeared to, at first, monopolize the best talent, Southern baseball heroes quickly emerged, none more famous than the Georgian, Ty Cobb. Some critics of baseball even worried that a fascination with with such a game, better left to children, would hurt Southern culture. "," A Richmond newspaper spoke of baseball as, thoroughly democratic; leveling all ranks, and all social differences are forgotten, and sure enough, blacks and whites flocked to the game as both players and fans. In the 1880's games and grandstands were very much interracial; however, this phenomenon would quickly disappear in the 1890's. Along with other forms of discrimination sweeping the South during this decade, white teams no longer found it honorable to play black teams, leading the game to the segregation that it would finally overcome in the mid-twentieth century.

On February 25, 1885 it covered the front page news, flags flew at half-mast, locomotives were shrouded, and traffic stopped, while people flooded to his funeral. The city had lost a respected citizen and a leading businessman, regarded as one of the South's best railroad men. Gittio, thinking he had a cold, had called upon a doctor who discovered pronounced heart trouble and, to the shock of the region, he died a few days later. Gittio embodied a rags to riches story, as he started his work on the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad in 1854 as a sixteen year old boy. He would eventually work his way up to becoming superintendent of the line, and he would exert great influence in all the railroads that stretched out from the Norfolk region. Despite his personal high standing, the Norfolk paper explained, He took great pride in the advancement and the prosperity of his native city. As his wife and young boy looked on in grief, Gittio's pall-bearers, railroad men themselves, laid the forty eight year old to rest. "," Evident in the high respect afforded Capt Gittio, railroads would develop a special meaning to the postwar South, as they embodied forward progress and development. At the outset of Reconstruction, the South's prosperity lagged far behind that of the rest of the country, and people hoped railroad construction would revitalize the Southern economy. Due to political mishandling, railroad construction during Reconstruction hardly existed, but thereafter until the turn of the century, the South would build railroads faster than any part of the country. Utilizing mostly Northern capital, Southern railroad mileage increased from 16,605 miles in 1880 to 39,103 miles in 1890. Soon, 90 percent of Southerners would live in a county with railroads. In big Southern cities railroad consolidation and expansion would lead to the creation of a central downtown station, from which a vibrant business district would grow. Such improved access to this reliable, quicker means of transportation revolutionized the way business was conducted, evidenced in the boom of mass production and mass distribution during this era. "," Despite the aura that encompassed them, Southern railroads, like the one Gittio managed, did not always bring prosperity and happiness. Oftentimes railroads and railroad construction could be linked to corrupt ties with political parties, especially evident in Virginia's case. Economically, though railroads lowered transportation costs for businesses, their rates often seemed oppressive to farmers trying to ship their crops, leading to populist calls for rate regulation and government commissions. Socially, they became center stage for the separate but equal theory that would eventually manifest itself into outright segregation. Nonetheless, new railways seemed to bring new opportunities for many of those along the line, and for these reasons the Portsmouth community chose to remember Capt. Gittio and his career so gratefully.

It was a crusade for self-improvement and the industrial work ethic. One man from nearby Washington, N.C., only identified as 'A Free Drinker,' felt he had to speak up. In a letter to the editor, the writer reminded the reading public that there were two sides to the issue, and the logic of the temperance movement was flawed on many accounts. Not all those who drank were sordid drunks, as the temperance societies believed. These societies opposed the drinking of all liquor, never mind how good the quality or how small the quantity. Drinking was not an idle habit, but rather a stimulating social activity. Jovial parties and pleasant games went well with a glass of the best. The temperance societies would use the money from alcohol on things like clothing and education for the children, but the writer noted that dressing up children only corrupts them and makes them arrogant. He went on, And as to giving children an education, I am inclined to think the policy of it rather doubtful... You have no doubt heard, sir, of the great number of forgeries that have been made of late years on banks and merchants. Now if these guilty persons had never learned to read and write, could they have committed these forgeries? The rhetoric of sarcasm veiled his disregard for these moral reformers. He went on to reveal that his wife nearly forced him to join one of these temperance societies, but a friend informed him that pledging to join was a sin - and he could not commit a known sin As if to perfectly demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the temperance societies in east North Carolina, the same friend quipped, There was a great deal of liquor in town that had to be drank by somebody.","Temperance societies emerged around the same time in the North and the South, in the 1830s. Yet the issue did not seem to resonate with many Southerners, especially the wealthy population of the Carolina coast. Many historians believe the movement lagged behind in the South because its citizens feared that the cause of temperance was tied to the cause of abolitionism. The temperance unions that did form in the South always made their proslavery opinions publicly known. Yet, as Ian Tyrell notes, this notion does not explain the whole issue. Many southern slaveholders joined the temperance reformers, voicing concerns about the public drunkenness of slaves and free blacks. In fact, what the South lacked that the North possessed was a growing immigrant population and a social environment of urbanization. The people that supported the temperance movements in the South were not the farmers and planters: they were the artisans and merchants, the laboring middle class.

The general assembly failed to pass a law that would prohibit anyone under the age of 13 from working in cotton factories. The Savannah Press was disturbed by the actions taken by the legislators in Georgia. The general assembly's actions showed that the need for production outweighed the importance of fair labor standards. ","During the nineteenth century many farmers planed cotton throughout the South. In Georgia, cotton was one of the main cash crops. Before the Civil War slaves worked on cotton plantations which attempted to meet the great national and international consumer need for the product. After the Civil War, freedom was declared for African Americans and many plantation owners lost much of their labor force. The owners of plantations needed people to work the land in order to make sure the need for cotton was met. At the time of the industrialization of America the cotton industry grew, and cotton factories were built throughout the South. Cotton manufacturers needed workers in these factories, and the age of the worker did not seem to matter. Manufacturers were willing to employ anyone and the age or the person did not matter. It seemed to the Savannah Press that the necessity for cotton outweighed moral values of the employers who ran the cotton factories. Employers tended to depend on women and children who were under the age of 16 as the main source of the labor force. One textile executive stated that many employers took no regard as to who should work and how many hours a person should work. The legislators in Georgia seemed to agree with the cotton factory employers on the idea that having as many workers as possible in order to meet the demand for cotton was of the utmost importance.

The Bill argued that the Southwestern part of Virginia needed access to major trade routes. The majority was in opposition to the original bill (for many reasons, particularly monetary), so Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge County, Virginia proposed a substitute bill, which was found more agreeable by the legislature than the original. The preamble was as follows: Whereas it is important to the interests of the Southwestern part of Virginia, and of the State and public generally, that the vast resources of that section of Virginia shall have free and unrestricted outlet, but the shortest and most direct route, to any market whatsoever.","After heated debate, the Virginia Legislature eventually rejected the bill.

A Democratic workingman had no trouble speaking his mind to a Norfolk gentleman, out on the streets, when asked of his opinion of President Cleveland. The workingman, having so ardently supported the first Democratic president-elect since Reconstruction, expressed a widespread Southern feeling of discontent towards the man whose election had so recently stirred uncontrollable celebrations throughout the South. As a loyal rank and file Democrat, this man expected to be rewarded for his vote. Instead, he found himself turned away from what, in his own mind, should have been party jobs. Regarding Cleveland's lack of patronage he replied, Whoever heard of an Army [that] after cleaning out and capturing the entire camp, turns over all the spoils of war and commissary stores to the enemy? Why it is the d---dest foolishness in the world Democrats, either turned away from patronage jobs across the city or left to compete for single jobs with hundreds of others, felt betrayed by the administration. With mouths to feed at home, the workingman knew he could only remain passive for so long, as his options ran low."," Before and during the Gilded Age, a politician's duty included getting jobs for his supporters, especially in the South, where political patronage formed a large part of party cohesion. In the 1880's, the Civil Service system, technically, underwent reforms like the Pendleton Act, hoping to replace the spoils system with a more permanent government bureaucracy based on merit. Nonetheless, in practice, government positions at all levels still went to those who had been loyal to the party. Thus, when Cleveland won the election in 1884, the South thought it had great reason to rejoice. Finally, Reconstruction, at the hands of meddling Republican presidents, would be ended and the Democratic South could look to the spoils of their great victory. "," Cleveland had campaigned as a Bourbon Democrat, or one who encouraged economic growth and also sought to remedy corruption in government, namely Civil Service Reform. Southern Democrats, too busy celebrating, did not anticipate Cleveland to stand by that platform, much like other politicians who ran on such appeals. He left many Republicans in their government jobs, meaning that in Virginia, Readjusters still filled spots that the average Democrats believed were rightly theirs. Southern political figures, especially from Virginia complained to Cleveland and asked him to reward their support, becoming insulted when he refused. Terribly disillusioned, Democrats in Virginia would not forget Cleveland's neglect, and when the national Democratic Party re-nominated him in 1892, Virginian Democratic voters place their support elsewhere. Their statement would ring hollow, as Cleveland regained the presidency.

On April 18, 1831, a duel took place in Richmond, Virginia, between a Mr. Prior and a Mr. Rae. Both gentleman resided in the central Virginia region and were of the wealthy class among their local communities. The fight began over a dispute about the Hampton Academy, a topic of much debate over the past 18 months. Mr. Prior suffered no injuries during the incident while Mr. Rae was shot in both legs. He then was carried many miles to safety which only aggravated his injuries even more and brought him closer to his death. "," This story of Mr. Prior and Mr. Rae, published in the Virginia Herald newspaper, illustrates an important idea concerning the personality of southern white men during this time period. Above all else, honor was the most essential characteristic a white man could have. It was what separated him from the blacks, and what helped him gain the respect and admiration of his peers in the community. Kenneth Greenberg, in Honor & Slavery, describes southern white men as superficial. He states that They were concerned, to a degree we would consider unusual, with the surface of things-with the world of appearances. Southerners took pride in their words as well as the general appearance they displayed to the world. The quarrels often originated from accusations, insulting words, or verbal disagreements. If a man questioned another man's words or negatively commented on his outlook, many were willing to fight to the death over it. ","It is very important to see how Mr. Prior and Mr. Rae were willing to put their lives on the line for what we would see as trivial instances of name calling and verbal disagreement. For them, these were profoundly important instances that called into question their trustworthiness and honor. Greenberg recognizes the minor importance of death when he says, Free and honorable gentlemen were not afraid to die because they believed that mastery over the fear of death seemed a precondition for life as free men.

For women, one way was through clothing. By purchasing foreign fabrics and copying the styles of Paris, American women were able to display that they were no less than European women.

Newspapers contained similar articles to inform the public of sporadic attacks on innocent settlers like a murdered old woman (Indian Depredations) who was killed by a number of 50 or 60 Indians. ","The task of pushing these tribes out of the Mississippi Delta area often induced fighting and violence as reported in recovered dispatches between Andrew Jackson and General Gaines.

The United States generously offered to pay expenses for any Indians who wished to migrate to the west and even proposed paying the Cherokee nation 200,000 for all their lands in the east. This proposition was quickly turned down due to the fact that these tribes did not wish to revert to primitive ways of living on the frontier as they once had to do.","As the search for prosperous land increased the United States could no longer promise to keep settlers out of the regions claimed and inhabited by Indians. After lots of negotiation and significant pressure from the American government the Chickasaw tribe agreed to settle for 300,000 in which they would receive in annual installments for twenty years. The Choctaw tribe was also pushed out of the state of Mississippi and combined, these two groups surrendered to the United States twenty million acres of land.

Since these children were not of the age to legally stand on their own, Murrell took it upon himself to act on their behalf. He wrestled with the choice of what to do with this inheritance, the choice made more difficult by his lack of detailed knowledge about the property since it was in Virginia and he in Louisiana."," In a letter to his brother - who was in Lynchburg and therefore in closer proximity to the property - Murrell mulled over his different options, deciding that neither cash nor bank stock was a stable enough source in which to make an investment. Another possibility was an investment in Western lands which would in my estimation be a safe one and one that would annually increase in value - but in my condition I could not leave home to attend it. Murrell recognized the benefits of actually following through with claiming such property but had reservations about not being in peak health."," Conversely he acknowledged that Negro property would be of service to him and since he - and his children - will come into ownership of that property during his lifetime, it is of that kind that [he] would like to have possession.

With this kind of moral argument coming into play, it was only a matter of time before the topic of slavery joined the discussion. Those same citizens that were packing up to move out west came from a variety of backgrounds, some of them slaveholding. They had no intention of surrendering that as they sought more land."," Murrell's letter and its close mention of expansion and slavery is indicative of the contemporaneous stage that was being set for American politics.

Newspapers kept citizens up to date with daily progress by their American troops south of the border, including lists of the casualties as well as those enlisting. New Orleans residents opened up their <em>Times Picayune</em>s the morning of July 8 to read a familiar notice, entitled Departure of Troops. It announced that the steamship New Orleans, along with her captain, Captain Auld, had departed from the city the previous night, headed for Mexico. On board was a full ship's worth of passengers, both men and animals. The full inventory consisted of 151 horses, Captain Dobbius' company 4th Infantry, Captain Featherstone's company Louisiana Volunteers and 50 quartermaster's men."," These men were leaving behind the humid, crowded and filthy streets of New Orleans for another undesirable location: a war zone close to Mexico City, Mexico. They arrived back on land likely just in time to play a part in the last major battle of the Mexican War at Contreras. At this site, Mexico sustained over 700 casualties while the United States walked away with a mere 60. The Mexican War officially began on April 25, 1846, when Mexicans opened fire on Americans in southern Texas. Although the Mexicans appeared to start the war in the sense that they did fire the first shots, Americans can be considered the true instigator: Texas had declared itself to be an independent republic from Mexico in 1835, but it essentially remained Mexican territory until the United States annexed it ten years later. "," This annexation may have been a conscious part on then-President Polk's part to actively cause a war with the intention of winning and gaining land. After all, Mexico had plenty of territory after which the United States lusted, and America did emerge from the war with both California and parts of the modern day Southwest. This war did not have the same urgency that past wars fought on American soil had had: never were the war strategizers worried that they would lose. The United States was cool and collected in comparison to the disorganized and flustered Mexican government, and the possibility of anything but a victory seemed remote at best. Regardless of the United States' confidence, they continued to battle bravely in Mexico. A year prior to Captain Auld's departure for Mexico, the Mexican President had claimed that his soldiers would not only regain control of Texas, but also work their way into the existing states - a few cities in Louisiana in particular. This direct threat to New Orleans likely prompted the strong turn-out.

The city had become one of the premier metropolises of not only the state but also the entire South, thanks to the convergence of the Mississippi with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the abundance of water routes, the need for other methods of transportation grew along with the city. Far from being the lazy South that has been romanticized in literature, this part of the country was bustling with trade and a rapid trend towards efficiency. Out of that desire, a minority within the Louisiana Committee on Internal Improvements took it upon themselves to investigate the complete installation of a railroad line connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This committee published a Minority Report in 1853 urging the state legislature to approve immediate funding of this line. Forty-six of the ninety-one mile stretch between the two cities had already been constructed and were in daily use, so it was just a matter of completing the job previously begun. The committee agreed that the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Railroad is a work of great public utility and that the line... is superior to that of any railroad in the state. They claimed that, upon completion of the railroad, travel time between the cities would be reduced to a mere three hours, and at a cost of just 3 per ride. Not only would this be an advantage to anyone living in either Baton Rouge or New Orleans, but it would be particularly beneficial to members of legislature. The railroad could now afford them the opportunity to attend their meetings at shorter notice and still be home by nightfall.","The South was truly growing at a rapid rate, and the addition of a railroad line portrays that growth quite clearly. No longer were waterways sufficient; faster overland travel was a necessary addition to the well-being of Louisiana's inhabitants. The scramble to improve transportation was being seen all over the young country, so much so that the national government became involved. Congress bequeathed land to states for the express purpose of improving travel routes, and Louisiana was no exception. Congress agreed to grant 100,000 acres to its railroad construction, knowing that the state's eventual gains meant that their economic loss would not be sustained for long.

According to the Wellsburg Herald, the black population of Wellsburg had been meeting nightly at societies or parties at the residences of other free blacks. But on this particular night something went wrong, or as the local white-owned newspaper mused, [the party] appears...to have been diverted from its legitimate object - affording an opportunity for the younger classes to meet, court, and sport together. The -'green-eyed monster' jealousy was of course not idle. A young free black man by the name of Thomas Groves was in town briefly as an employee on the steamer Miami and attended the party. When he left the house in the company of a local black woman, he got into an altercation with a group of local black men over his relationship with the woman. In the ensuing quarrel a member of the group pulled out a pistol and killed Groves. Though the identity of the actual killer was not known at press time, six of the men had been arrested on charge of being concerned in the riot. A hearing was scheduled for that afternoon.","Western Virginia, soon to become the new state of West Virginia, did not secede from the Union, and thus became a haven for free black men and escaped slaves during and after the Civil War. The border between West Virginia and Virginia was an important escape route from the Confederate states to the Upper South. Many former slaves were drawn to the area by the promise of a large number of high-paying jobs created by the burgeoning mining and timber industries. But in some cases, the influx of newly-free blacks was scarcely tolerated by the whites of the northern Border States. In an area that had traditionally had few blacks because of the lack of demand for slaves, the immigration of African Americans heightened tensions between the two races. The high tensions sometimes led to violence. In this case, however, the violence was limited to the black race, and so was looked on more as a diversion rather than cause for alarm.","Many of these escaped slaves became useful members of the Union Army, and some even became soldiers after conscription of African-Americans was approved in 1863. However, white attitudes toward free blacks in the South would remain a problem well into the 20th century, and soon black-on-black crime would be relatively ignored by many local southern authorities. Though the men in this case were arrested and perhaps even given a trial, this attitude of disdain among the whites would only increase during Reconstruction, and eventually transform into the codified racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the displacement of large groups of slaves during the Civil War and the sudden complete emancipation of the 14th Amendment, blacks and whites would be forced to deal with each other on grounds unfamiliar to both races.

The <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record, speaks of an imposing and influential political convention in 1832. Attended by people from all over the State, the delegates called themselves National Republicans and adopted resolutions which called for Henry Clay for president. Four years earlier, the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> ran a little piece explaining just how much Virginia, and especially Augusta County was stacked against Clay's rival, Andrew Jackson. James Madison and James Monroe are opposed to the election of gen. Jackson...John Marshall is opposed...four out five judges of the high court of appeals are opposed to gen. Jackson. The <em>Spectator</em> then spoke of Augusta: There are thirty-six justices of the peace in the county; of which 31 are opposed to Gen. Jackson... The mayor, recorder, three (out of four) alderman and five councilmen (out of six, with the sixth on the fence), Unsurprisingly, the <em>Annals</em> claim that when President Jackson came through the Shenandoah Valley on his way down to Tennessee on July 27, 1832, he as usual avoided Staunton, preferring to stay in the neighboring town of Waynesboro."," On the other hand when Henry Clay came through town just two days later, he was called on by many citizens. He had visited four years earlier as well, and the <em>Spectator </em>related a charming story about the man as he passed through the County. Clay was walking by a schoolhouse where a lot of boys were out playing and he asked one of them if he could have a cup of water. After Clay had drunk his fill, the boy emboldened by his friendly manner asked Clay his name. Mr. Clay, he exclaimed, from Washington City? As soon as Clay responded, the air reverberated with the cry of Huzza for Clay and Adams-We are all for Clay and Adams here-Huzza for Clay and Adams"," Of course, Jackson would have the upper hand in the end, defeating Clay in the national election of November 1832. But in a way, Augusta's staunch allegiance to the Whigs-even under greater sectional tension in 1859, Augusta still claimed a Whig majority-demonstrates the idea that Edward Ayers espouses when examining party affiliations in the first half of the eighteenth century, that once formed, political loyalties were hard to break. People in the first half of the nineteenth century did not join political parties purely out of individual ideology, but rather they often followed their neighbors, especially the prominent ones because they could then stand to receive political prestige and influence.

On a Saturday night in late October 1832, Joseph Wienand, the manager of the Neptune Hotel in Charleston, was murdered. Apparently, he was in possession of between 200 and 300 in cash. His murder was discovered by his African-American female servant at close to 6 a.m. the next day. After repeatedly rapping on his door to awaken him to start the day, the servant became nervous and forced her way into his room. He was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Upon investigation by a coroner, it was declared that he was murdered by strangulation with a handkerchief and by blows to his head with a stone. It was a sad fate for Mr. Wienand, a good member of Charleston society. ","Like any other city, murder and crime were facets of life in Charleston; however, it was not a huge problem for the antebellum city. In fact, the problems of regulating crime were more centered on slaves and free blacks rather than whites. Whether a white person or a black person killed Mr. Wienand is not known. However, it was quite apparent that as time wore on, white members of Charleston society who committed crimes were subjected to more lenient punishments than their black counterparts. In fact, city leaders became so worried about slaves and free African Americans committing crimes that the Charleston Work House was established in 1839. That year, the Work House became a house of correction for slaves. In addition to becoming a place for the punishment of slaves who committed various offenses or crimes, the Work House was also established so that the city would have a central place for a slave market. The work house was run under Spartan conditions and in a correctional manner. Many considered it a deterrent to committing crimes. No one wanted to go to the Work House. In addition, it was designed in a Gothic Revival style, similar to that of many churches built after the Great Fire of 1838, serving as a reminder that the righteous did not commit crimes like that one that was so cruelly bestowed on Mr. Wienand. ","Judging from the murder of Charleston hotel manager Joseph Wienand, one would assume Charleston was unsafe. However, as Maurie McInnis points out in a chapter of her book, <em>The Politics of Taste in Antebellum Charleston</em>, crime was greatly controlled in Charleston during the 1830s and 1840s, thanks in large part to fear of being incarcerated in the Work House. Most Charlestonians need not worry that they would be victims like Mr. Wienand."],"display_date":"October 29, 1832","search_date":"1832-10-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3527,"title":"Slaves Drown While Fishing\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-08-01","end_date":"1842-08-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a blustery summer day, August 1, 1842, a fishing boat in which five slaves were traveling was swamped and capsized. Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3530,"title":"Northern Abolitionists Influence on Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-25","end_date":"1837-01-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the years passed, it seemed that more and more Americans became frustrated with the institution of slavery. But there were many in the South who dissented from this opinion, who held steadfast to the ideal that slavery was a just institution. E.W. Taylor was one of them. Taylor, who moved to Charleston from the North to become a slave owner, enjoyed the perks of ownership to the fullest extent. Presumably a bachelor, Taylor realized soon after making his purchase how enjoyable it was to have a female to make his house into a home. To Taylor, having a woman to cook his meals and clean house was the best gift slavery could offer. ","However, soon after his arrival in the South, Taylor was inundated with of anti-slavery propaganda from Northern abolitionists. Concluding that the actions of these abolitionists had the potential to cause separation of the Union, he was of the belief that abolitionists should pay attention to their own affairs. Many Southerners like Taylor believed that slavery was not the cruel institution portrayed by Northern abolitionist. In an 1837 letter to Jeremiah Wilbur, a friend from New York, he recounted the tale of a minister from the North who met a wealthy slave-owning woman from the South. Up until that point, the minister had made it known that he was against slavery and for abolition. However, the minister and the woman fell in love, and the minister began to change his previous thinking. He began to rant against Northern abolitionists and Northerners in general. Ironically, he had once been an abolitionist himself.","Abolitionism was a great concern for many in Charleston. Like Taylor, prominent members of Charleston society feared that if slavery was abolished, hired labor would come to resemble hired labor in the North- a cruel, cautionary tale against capitalism. Abolitionists were only causing distress in Southern cities like Charleston. ","Taylor's views on slavery and abolitionism echoed those of many Southerners, especially those who resented being inundated with propaganda. Abolitionists accused slaveholders of many cruelties, including forced reproduction and childbearing of female slaves, and not allowing slaves to practice religion, just to name a few. According to historian Ira Berlin, abolitionists experienced difficulty proving many of these accusations, but the mere appearance of those caused uproar in the South and planted the seeds of disunion, as seen in Taylor's letter. E.W. Taylor exemplified Southerners for whom abolitionist propaganda from perceived hypocrites raised the spectre of disunion. Yet, many Northern abolitionists were, in fact, free blacks who were drawing on their own experiences in captivity for information for said abolitionist propaganda."],"display_date":"January 25, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-25","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3531,"title":"The Great Fire of Charleston and its Cultural Awakening\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-04-27","end_date":"1838-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27, 1838, an enormous fire broke out in Charleston, South Carolina, around 9:00 pm. It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings. It ruined many businesses, a new hotel, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Many houses were burnt to the ground. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used. In addition, several people died in the flames. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. The total monetary loss amounted to about 3,000,000, a sum even more significant in nineteenth century Charleston than today. ","A newspaper article mentioned that several slaves died in the fire, but declined to name them, unlike the many white victims who were named. This reflected the social hierarchy. A long obituary was even given for Colonel Charles John Steedman, a Naval Officer stationed in Charleston, on account of his exemplary citizenship both before and during the fire. Additionally, several prominent store owners are listed as having died attempting to save their stores. Ironically, the fire did not cause Charleston's demise. Rather, it caused a great cultural awakening as many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired. ","The Great Fire of 1838 had a far-reaching impact on the city of Charleston. In many ways, it helped to put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Although previous to the fire only a few homes were styled in the Greek Revival, many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion. This may have also represented an effort to portray the slaveholders who were attending these churches are benevolent, Christian men and women. Gothic was not used for state buildings, however, as James Patrick confirms in his article Ecclesiological Gothic in the Antebellum South. In addition to being used for religious buildings in Charleston, the use of the Gothic, according to Patrick, reflected an attempt to portray Southern locales such as Charleston in the most romantic light possible. Southerners were fighting to keep their culture alive, especially in state like South Carolina, where there was constantly talk of nullification and states rights after the Nullification Crisis. All in all, the art and architecture of Charleston had great implications for a city rebuilt after a horrific fire."],"display_date":"April 27, 1838","search_date":"1838-04-27","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3535,"title":"Christianity as a Justification for Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-09-29","end_date":"1835-09-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Slave owners had many justifications for why holding people in bondage was acceptable. From the idea that African Americans were a lesser race who needed taking care of by white patriarchs to the economic justification, slave owners were always trying to find new ways to dispute those who disagreed with their choice to hold others in captivity. Charleston slave holders were no exception in attempting to find justifications to mask their guilt. Often, religion came into play, on both the slavery and anti-slavery sides of the debate. In 1835, at the end of two long articles about religion and slavery in the Charleston Mercury, it was said that both the Old and New Testament give permission to hold others as slaves. In the Old Testament, God and the Patriarchs approve. As for the New Testament, Jesus and the Apostles show that slavery is permissible. Therefore, slavery, to those who wrote the article, was not an anti-Christian institution. It was just the opposite. Furthermore, they added, it is impious to say slavery is anti-Christian because such a conclusion contradicted God. ","Such extremist beliefs were common in the slavery/antislavery debate. Slaveholders believed that slavery would liberate Africans from their savage-like ways, especially if they were infused with Christianity. As religion ran deep through slavery, white Christian slaveholders argued that slavery was a necessary evil because it would control the sinful, less humane, black race. ","Slave owners, beginning in the 1830s, began to permit black religious gatherings in some forms. In addition, Charleston slaves and free blacks were allowed to attend church with their owners. However, previous slave revolts like Virginia's Nat Turner caused worry that religion would make slaves think they had the right to be free. Turner experienced religious visions that caused him to believe that revolt was divinely ordained. Slaves allowed by their masters to worship were closely monitored thereafter.","Even though the article in <em>The</em> <em>Charleston Mercury</em> claimed that Jesus supported slavery, the Biblical truth is, according to J. Albert Harrill, that Jesus was remarkably silent on the slavery issue. He never outright named it explicitly as a sin. Both sides of the slavery/anti-slavery debate used this ambiguity to their advantage, embellishing the details that supported their case. The slaveholding South stretched the truth and claimed that Jesus permitted slavery. The anti-slavery North claimed that Jesus never said sodomy, blasphemy, and idolatry were sins, even though to Christians, they clearly are. The word of the Lord, to them, did not have to spell out what was right and wrong. Overall, both sides of the debate used religion to their advantage, stretching the truth wherever necessary to help their cause, just as in this article from <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>."],"display_date":"September 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3563,"title":"John Scott&#39;s Estate and Removal to the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["John Scott III of Scottsville was the grandson of the man on whose land the first Albemarle County seat was located when the county's was created in 1744. Edward Scott had offered his land to build the first courthouse, in the hopes that commerce would develop nearby and increase the value of his large patent. The proximity of the site to a section of the James River especially conducive to crossing aided this stratagem. In the coming decades Scott's Landing developed into the most important port upstream of Richmond. Various Scotts and nearby merchants tried for years to incorporate the settlement as an official town, but none were successful until John III, in 1818; the town was called Scottsville, and contained dozens of lots on land donated by John. In the following two years the town was party to other favorable developments. The founding of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville promised to bring large shipments of building supplies through Scottsville's warehouses. In the 1810s the state government chartered two stock companies that enabled Scottsville to act as a hub of transportation: one to build a toll road from Staunton, one to improve canals along the James up from Richmond. In spite of these promising developments, John Scott, by fall of 1821, began auctioning off his estate. He described it as the most valuable real estate in Virginia Containing about 15 Hundred Acres. Four hundred of which are Low Grounds, Inferior to none on the stream. He sold the estate at public auction on the premises, emphasizing the 'high state of cultivation' [and] Elegant Building, also offering the stock and crops of the estate, plus a valuable tract of woodland. Curiously, Scott only managed to sell part of this magnificent estate in 1821, and had to hold another auction in 1822.","In the advertisement for his auction, Scott declared that he was intending to remove to the South. Though born in Albemarle, Scott had already lived in the South some years, practicing medicine in Alabama. Like thousands of Virginians, he may have gone down South in the years following the War of 1812, to make a life in one of the new towns that cropped up all over the territory acquired from the post-war Indian treaties. Scott probably only returned east when he inherited the Scottsville estate upon his grandfather's death. Upon receiving his inheritance, he may have discovered himself unaccustomed to estate operation, and wished to return to his medical practice. Another possibility is that the general economic atmosphere discouraged him from focusing his life on the estate. Although the factors mentioned above aided the economy in Scottsville, the overall Virginia economy had been sluggish ever since the national Panic of 1819. It could simply be that when Scott was down South he met a nice southern belle.

Hubard of Washington, D.C. wrote a letter to his nephew, James L. Hubard, of Buckingham County, Virginia. James was a young man at the time, still in the formative stages of his life, and it appears that he and his uncle corresponded regularly about education, family life, and women in central and northern Virginia. E.W. began the letter by acknowledging his receipt of James' last dispatch, dated the twentieth of January; during the mid-nineteenth century, parcel mail was still transported largely by horse-drawn carriage, so a three-week delivery period from Buckingham to Washington would not have been out of the ordinary. In the subsequent paragraphs, James' uncle addressed several aspects of the affluent, civilized lifestyle he led and advises his young nephew on the values of a southern gentleman. ","First, E.W. praised James for reading the new books that he sent to his nephew. James was very studious and intelligent, qualities evidenced by the fact that he finished the books very quickly and impressed his uncle with his voracious appetite for learning. E.W. could only hope, he wrote, that William, Robert, and Edmund (James' little brothers) follow in [his] good example and engage in reading and learning new literature. Next, the well heeled gentleman from the capitol city shared in his nephew's excitement over the success of his hunting and fishing expeditions. Although James wrote that he was a proficient shooter, he also expressed his dissatisfaction with his attempts at trapping. His uncle responded by offering his opinion on the two methods of hunting game, praising the virtues of trapping animals when he stated, It takes more sense and skill to out-wit and catch them, than to take your gun and shoot them. Trapping, he declared, is accomplished by tact and skill while hunting with a rifle depends on the force of powder and shot; this emphasis on guile and cunning is a recurring theme of E.W. Hubard's letter. Lastly, E.W. encouraged James to develop his musical talent, expressing his belief that those who are gifted with a particular acumen for singing or playing an instrument should nurture those talents and develop their abilities to fruition. In closing, James' benevolent uncle requested that he pass on his love to the rest of the family, including his younger brothers, and to tell them that he wishes he could one day correspond with them in the same manner as he and James did then. ","E.W. Hubard's letter to his nephew embodies several facets of southern gentlemanliness and reveals a great deal about the education and upbringing of affluent young men in central Virginia. E.W. urged his nephew to read as much as he can, not only in an effort to enhance his intrinsic worth, but also to uphold the tradition of the family of scholarly appearance and reputation. He repeatedly moralized the values of cleverness, exemplified in his lecture on the desirability of the crafty entrapment of game animals rather than the brute force method of shooting from afar. According to E. Brooks Holifield's <em>The Gentlemen Theologians</em>, Among the goals of piety, in relation to the ideal of southern gentlemanliness, were introspective watchfulness, purity of intention, strenuous inner discipline, and self-control. E.W. Hubard echoed these qualities in his letter to his nephew when he claimed that gentlemanly behavior develops from a keen intellect, quick wit, a rapacious desire for reading, and the ability to excel at music and dance. These characteristics and high aspirations colored the various political, social, and economic interactions of southern white gentlemen during the mid-nineteenth century in central Virginia as well as the American South as a whole."],"display_date":"February 9, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-09","locations":[{"id":13689,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3574,"title":"Another Train Wreck\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-30","end_date":"1890-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rather than going to bed early Sunday night after a long day of church and family time, the city of Staunton spent the evening putting out a fire, only to then have a serious train wreck in the early hours of Monday, April 28, 1890. The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today. This one newspaper article intimated to its readers that Staunton was not just a dot on the map.

Civilized countries recognized the need of foreign trade to compete in this new arena. Foreign trade required the participation of everyone from government leaders to common citizens. A Florida resident, Cecil H. Alleyne expressed his concern over a Yellow Fever breakout and its effects on the world market. In his letter to the London Times in 1886 Alleyne describes the gravity of the disease in Jacksonville, Florida. ","Without health care systems or emergency rooms, Florida tried to deal with a Yellow Fever epidemic in the late nineteenth century. Subsequently, the disease ravaged parts of Florida including Key West, Manatee, Tampa, and Plant City. In Jacksonville alone by 1888 the disease had claimed 427 lives out of 4,656 reported cases. To try and tame the disease several cities set huge fires of pine and tar in an effort to cleanse contaminated areas. The Jacksonville Sanitary Association managed to raise 350,000 to fight the disease. At every level of government, Florida tried to control Yellow Fever from spreading. The mayor of Jacksonville quarantined areas in an effort to limit the outbreak of disease. Alleyne believed the quarantine and relief efforts that Florida put into effect successfully restricted the disease. One of the more radical approaches against the disease came in 1889 by Florida governor Francis P. Fleming. Fleming pushed for the creation of a state health board to regulate health problems and fight the yellow fever outbreak. Consequently, a new state constitution was created in 1887 putting Fleming's suggestions into legislation.","Alleyne's letter to the London Times Editor connects Florida to England in the world trade market. Alleyne felt that an outbreak of Yellow Fever was important enough to write the leading newspaper in London, illustrating the dependence of both parties for each other's imports and exports. In addition, Alleyne was able to paint a picture of how difficult life on the frontier was in the nineteenth century. Seminole attacks, outbreaks of disease, and aggressive Spanish inhabitants were everyday threats that Florida citizens had to cope with. Nevertheless, the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Florida produced a new state constitution and the creation of the Florida State Health Board.

Bailey. After his resettlement, Bailey became an active participant in government serving as Superintendent of Labor for the Engineers Department of the Eastern District of Florida and was even a candidate for Alachua County's commissioner of roads. In his personal letter to his friends and relatives back home in Alabama Bailey describes a business transaction in which he was trying to decide between a bond for title or a mortgage. This description shows the lack of bank involvement with citizens on personal transactions. It is hard to imagine writing a check for a piece of gum now without a paper trail to a bank, let alone depending on someone for documentation of your property. In addition, Bailey goes on to describe life in Florida in 1885 with trips to Augusta, highlighting the freedom of mobility created by the new railroads. And who could write a letter on Florida without commenting on the warm sunshine and delicious watermelon, both bountiful in Florida? Mr. Bailey showcases the appeals of Florida during this time period after Reconstruction and illustrates why people flocked to see this frontier of America. ","A bitter battle of Reconstruction brought an idle economy and uncertainty about the future. However, Florida Democrat William D. Bloxham believed that the woes caused by Reconstruction and the panic of 1873 could be fixed by raising property assessment values. Subsequently, the value of property rose from 31,500,000 in 1881 to 70,677,000, just four years later. Florida was an attractive location to nestle down and start a family. The pleasing Florida climate and profitable agricultural society caught the eye of many wealthy and not so wealthy emigrants who settled in Florida from the late nineteenth century on. James B. Bailey jumped on the opportunity to establish a prominent life in the illustrious Florida frontier and is an example of the emigration of United States to Florida during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Most of the city attended the ceremony, which was complete with an unveiling of the stone and speeches by prominent local lawyers, clerks, and judges. They spoke of historical events and the importance of the new courthouse. To signify this step towards the future, they made the cornerstone a time capsule. The city implanted many relics which will be of great future interest. The weekly paper, <em>The Staunton Spectator,</em> noted that the stone came from the same quarry as the Washington Monument. "," Readers should note the date of the laying of the stone. Augusta County receives only a few snowfalls each year, but the weather is cold. City officials, however, felt that the Christmas time and the cold weather would not hinder the city from celebrating. In fact, the city could build momentum off the holiday spirits. The <em>Washington Post</em> did not list the important relics, probably feeling that the citizens of Washington, D.C. would find this ground breaking interesting because of the quarry for the stone. This article lay above more dynamic articles concerning explosions and riots in other southern states. "," Mary Ryan has written that during the nineteenth century, the contests for public spaces were an indicator of the spread of democratic politics, but as Wayne Durrill pointed out, democracy itself did not necessarily spread just because people wanted to control these public spaces. Lynchings, for example, occurred in public places and are not indicative of spreading democracy. The city of Staunton recognized the importance of the courthouse and its strong role in the community. In the past, Staunton citizens prided themselves for their gas and music. They needed an equally impressive courthouse that could reflect the citizens' feelings of importance. Durrill also notes that the best way to gain political influence was through having the power to regulate and build the civic space, such as the courthouse. Based on the honorific titles of the men who gave the speeches at the ceremony, they were some of the most powerful men in the county. Their presence at the laying of the cornerstone of the courthouse let the city know the power and influence that they held. E. Lee Shepard has noted the importance of court days as political focal points. During these days, people bought and sold things, and they met socially to catch up and enjoy each other.

He had lived in Staunton for some time."," Evans was a small, very black, and very pompous negro, the author, Joseph Wadell wrote. He never forgot that he was 'a hero of the Revolution,' and therefore never laughed and rarely smiled. Wadell goes on to point out that Tom liked to use big words. His main claim to celebrity though, came from his propensity to wear his Revolutionary War uniform-cocked-hat, coat, and red short-breeches- on the 4th of July. He promenaded the streets to the public amusement and his own profit in the way of small coin levied by him on patriotic citizens. In Wadell's words, it is possible to hear a hint of ugliness that is reminiscent of the way free blacks were upbraided in Franklin, Pennsylvania in Edward Ayers',<em> In the Presence of mine Enemies</em>. The free blacks were denigrated as saucy and were chided for being too confident in the presence of whites. The same sense of perceived threat can be seen in Wadell's words as well. Tom seemed to hold himself with the respect of a white man for having taken part in the Revolutionary war and so he is called Very pompous and is made fun of for using long words.

Carpenter watched all the members of Congress as they descended upon Washington in preparation for the upcoming session. With them appeared lobbyists galore, bureaucrats too many to number and Washingtonians coming from the woodwork with something to sell to the incoming crowds. The city was booming; boarders and hotel owners were tidying and revitalizing their accommodations in order to attract customers, private individuals were opening their homes to newcomers to make a dollar or perhaps a companion, and prices were steadily increasing. Interestingly, visitors self-segregated somewhat based on the region they came from when it came to finding lodging and a social scene during session. There was everything from quiet, demure hotels for politicians who wished to be close to the White House to more raucous, lively hotels where you might find Congressmen bantering the night away. Frank knew where he could find someone in D.C. when Congress was in session. ","This session was marked with particular excitement for two reasons. First, the Democrats had become the majority party in the House of Representatives; second, the national election was right around the corner so Congressmen and aspiring politicians were already hard at work, campaigning for their very near futures. Frank was thrilled to be in the capital at a time like this one. ","Frank G. Carpenter was an author during the 19th century who traveled and wrote commentary pieces on life and society around the world. What he saw in 1882 in Washington D.C. is quite revealing about the dynamic between the city and the Congressmen, as well as between the Congressmen, and other visitors, themselves. Naturally, the city took complete advantage of Congress being in session every year. The influx meant more business, more money, more intrigue - more everything. Between the visitors and between the Congressmen it was very interesting that party lines were very much a function of geographic origin, and even more so, were very segregating. This polarization Carpenter witnessed supports a piece of historian Vincent P. De Santis' view of the political scene at the time, which involved the proliferation of Independent politicians as the parties strengthened. Men split from their parties in attempts to induce real change. The parties had become political machines, facing off with one another on every level, incapable of reacting in kind to the actual issues that confronted the federal government."],"display_date":1882,"search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3603,"title":"No Tolerance for Gambling\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-12-19","end_date":"1878-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The police had been keeping a close watch on various buildings around the city of Washington, D.C. where they believed that certain ordinary, reputable citizens of the community by day were, in fact, holding illicit card games by night. 1345 E Street and 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue topped the watch list for the D.C. police and they scheduled and executed a raid on No. 1345 in the middle of the night on December 19th. Led by Sergeants Hollinburger and Guy, the force of 12 men barged into the building only to find that the suspects had fled in the nick of time.         ","What they left behind in their haste to escape confirmed the Sergeants' suspicions: there was indeed a game of faro being played at the residence, and it probably was a regular occurrence that involved gambling of the most notorious, disgraceful kind. Among the evidence that had been left strewn before them, the officers found and confiscated very valuable and expensive items including fine alcohol, exquisite furniture, and the intricate game pieces themselves.         ","As luck would have it, not more than one month later, the police raided the E Street hideout again - this time, the gamblers were caught unawares.

","This incident is indicative of two major themes in Southern history during the last quarter of the 19th century, about which historian Paul Dolan writes. First, many forms of vice proliferated in the United States, and certain regions were notorious for certain vices, like the West and the South were for gambling. Second, Dolan notes, official police forces in the United States were just gaining ground, generally having been instituted around only 50 years prior to this raid in D.C.

The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites.

After marveling at the flowers and other wares, they decided to attend a nearby women's rights meeting. Jennie was not very impressed, despite being entertained by the goings on. She couldn't understand how women's lives and the state of things would be improved if women were given the right to vote. Not really very bothered, she and Clara finished their day with a trip to the dentist and dinner with family and friends.  ","Despite her nonchalance about the idea of women's suffrage, as viewed in this moment in her life, Jennie was an extremely self-empowered young woman. Her dedication to living a life full of education, religion, and social activities and events of all kinds is evident throughout her diary. As an upper-middle class young woman in Washington D.C., Jennie made a point to stay current on fashion, read novels such as '<em>Silas Marner'</em> or '<em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>' regularly, study and teach lessons for Sunday School, attend church and Christian Legion meetings, and do her domestic duties all at the same time.         ","Jennie's disinterest in the women's suffrage movement may then seem peculiar. However, Jennie was a Southerner, and the South was emerging from the Reconstruction Era in 1888. As the historian Louise M. Young explains, there was bitter resentment engendered in the South by the Reconstruction policies: a resentment that hardened into an emotional block against enfranchising women that was never resolved. Jennie enjoyed her life tremendously, from what she wrote in her diary, and enfranchisement wasn't going to add anything to her life that she felt she needed. In fact, the South felt that all the effort that had put forth in enfranchising black Americans during Reconstruction had created far more harm than good.

Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3614,"title":"Amherst County Citizens Petition for a Railroad \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, the period of time between 1848 and 1860 was relatively serene and well-organized in that particular area of central Virginia. Following the United States' triumphant victory in the Mexican War of 1848, one of Virginia's sons and a decorated hero from the war, General Zachary Taylor, was elected President. The era that began in 1850 is known to historians as an age of industrial and public improvement; the legislature and citizenry of Amherst County, for example, petitioned for the construction of a railroad connection between the cities of Lynchburg and Charlottesville. In 1851, the citizens of Amherst County wrote a petition to the governing body in Richmond arguing the position that the state of Virginia would be well-served if a connecting branch was constructed in their district. Citing the unity, consistency, and harmony that would result from the completion of the railroad, they argued eloquently and persuasively in the three-page memorandum. Their request was granted, and the decision to improve public transportation in central Virginia was not without precedent; in the previous year, a section of the Blue Ridge Turnpike was opened to public travel. The roads were engineered by General William Mahone, a man remembered as one of countless connections and political acumen and commemorated by Scott for his exceptional work on the highways.","Transportation during the mid-nineteenth century was still dominated by horsepower, and the opening of the highways provided an easier, more efficient passage through and around the Blue Ridge Mountains. In addition, the Orange and Alexandria railroad company was given special access to a private lot off the turnpike to construct buildings and operate businesses, a provision that would have increased employment opportunities and drawn a more focused attention at that particular intersection of railway and road. In addition to desiring one grand, systematized improvement, the authors of the Amherst County memorandum cited the increased potential for economic prosperity that would surely follow the construction of the connecting branch.","During the 1850s and 1860s, railroad technology was booming. Building on the advancements of earlier rail-related endeavors, such as the Baltimore and Ohio rail line that was the first to evolve into a major system, the railways of mid-century transported not only material goods but also the promise of economic expansion and proliferation. As the railroad snaked its way through the American South, it brought with it untold benefits of increasing population and the amplified opportunity for financial benefit. The construction and opening of roads like the Fredericksburg and Valley Plank Road and the Blue Ridge Turnpike not only facilitated improved travel in central Virginia but also, through its conciliatory provisions with flourishing railroad companies, opened avenues of future economic gain. Amherst County residents were acutely aware of this and, through a strongly worded petition to Richmond, affected a fortuitous change."],"display_date":"1850 - 1851","search_date":"1850-12-31","locations":[{"id":13622,"lat":37.6048121175,"lng":-79.1451153205,"zoom":9,"place":"AMHERST, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3641,"title":"The Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia Receives a Generous Donation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-01-01","end_date":"1817-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Eighteen Sixteen was an eventful year for the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia. The number of girls under the care of the Society was increased to twenty and a smallpox scare in the city required a visit from Society Physician Dr. Alex Whitehead for a round of vaccinations for all the girls. However, certainly the biggest event of the year happened in July when the Society received a letter from a generous citizen of the city. The letter was from the Executor of the will of Captain John Maxwell informing the Society that 2,500 had been bequeathed to them for the purpose of establishing an Asylum for Female Orphans. Additionally, Captain Maxwell's Executor had already purchased a lot on Brigg's Point for the new structure."," The 1816 annual report of the Female Orphan Society shows their elation at receiving such a large donation. The report states that they would desire... to proclaim our gratitude to our deceased benefactor & to God, the inspirer of all good, for this generous gift which promises to perpetuate our institution as a lasting honor & blessing to the community. Their happiness is well understood when one considers the average yearly earnings of a small-time farmer during the era was well under one thousand dollars. Simply put, 2,500 was a lot of money."," The Female Orphan Society was not a fledgling organization. It was founded in 1804 by Norfolk women in order to provide a temporary home, education and training for indigent white girls, orphans or otherwise. In order to stay afloat, the organization relied on the generosity of private individuals, churches, relief agencies, and finally clubs or other organizations to provide food, clothing, education for the wards, and wages for Society employees. The fact that after twelve years the organization had not yet acquired their own building shows the difficulty of financing a charitable organization such as the Society. In fact, at the time the Society received the donation, they were just deciding that they had sufficient funds to attempt to look for a lot for the construction of their own building. Such a large donation allowed the Society to build a larger building than perhaps they had hoped, enabling them to expand the breadth of their charitable work. Orphan Societies such as the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk factored greatly in the lives of America's poor children from the early nineteenth century until the 1920s. The Society of Norfolk was typical of these early institutions in that it was established to help female children and dealt mostly with children who had one or more parents living. These institutions served to help a family through tough times by providing for a child until the parent was able to do so themselves. The Norfolk Society was also indicative of Orphan Societies at the beginning of the nineteenth century in that it was entirely funded by private donations and managed by specific religious organizations. "," Orphan Societies began to be established in response to changes in the United States as a whole. During the early nineteenth century, American cities experienced massive growth due to European immigration. Cities grew by leaps and bounds and the population of urban poor grew with them. Additionally, the growth of wage labor often left many of these poor families unable to care for their children after a tragedy like the loss of a parent. Finally, improved transportation facilitated the easier spread of diseases like cholera, which led to a spike in the establishment of orphanages after an epidemic in the 1830s. By the Civil War, Orphan Societies had become very common across the United States and were thought of as being the best way to manage the upbringing and education of poor children outside of their own homes."],"display_date":"January 1, 1816 - January 1, 1817","search_date":"1816-07-02","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3642,"title":"The Marquis de Lafayette Visits Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-10-19","end_date":"1824-10-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although a Frenchmen, the Marquis de Lafayette was a man dear to the hearts of many Americans in the early nineteenth century. He led American troops into battle during the Revolution, had sustained a wound at the Battle of Brandywine, and was instrumental in encouraging the participation of the French forces in the siege of Yorktown which led to the surrender of the British in 1781. Lafayette was not the only foreign officer to serve in the Continental Army, but he was revered for his generosity, friendliness, bravery, and genuine love for America, his adopted country. "," It is no wonder then that when in October of 1824 the Marquis, now quite an old man, landed in the city of Norfolk a great reception awaited him. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> reported the spectacle awaiting Lafayette upon his landing which included an artillery salute, a triumphal arch erected in his honor, ranks of local militia, the assembled Corporate Societies of the Borough, and large groups of school children including those of the Female Orphan Society. All this made for what the Herald described as a truly animating picture. Additionally, the Herald reported that in the evening the businesses and dwellings of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth were brilliantly illuminated, the latter municipality lighting 42 bonfires on the shores in honor of the Marquis. Sometime during his stay, a trip across the river to the city of Portsmouth was planned in order that Lafayette might pay a visit to the United States Naval Yard there. Louisa Emmerson, a life-long Portsmouth native wrote that the Trustees of Portsmouth welcomed him to their town, and with military honors conducted him to Crawford Street, where at its intersection with High, a fine triumphal arch had been erected in the General's honor. The arch itself was finely constructed and decorated with American flags, evergreen boughs, and flowers. Mrs. Emmerson wrote that before continuing to the Naval Yard, the procession stopped so that some school children of the city could recite a poem for the distinguished guest. "," Clearly, the Marquis' visit was quite an event for the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth. It certainly was not everyday that a small city was graced with the presence of one of the most venerated heroes of the Revolution, a man that Louisa Emerson described as second only to Washington. For more than a month, the Herald reported on the receptions of the Nation's Guest as he toured the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Richmond, and Williamsburg. Day after day, near full pages of newsprint was spent describing his stay in each city with particular detail. The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette was perhaps the event of a lifetime. Norfolk was only one of many stops on Lafayette's Farewell Tour of America. From 1824 to 1825, Lafayette visited all twenty-four states in the Union. Along the way he was treated to numerous dinners and balls in his honor. He listened to speeches, he attended plays, he visited Revolutionary War veterans, and he laid the cornerstones to several monuments to the American Revolution including the Bunker Hill monument. No expense was spared in celebrating the return of the hero. "," The year 1824 was the perfect moment for Lafayette to make his return. America was experiencing a prosperous and peaceful period in its history. Cities were growing and industry was beginning to develop. The occasion of Lafayette's visit was a chance for the burgeoning American glass, printing, and pottery industries to flex their muscles as they churned out a variety of commemorative items emblazoned with the image of Lafayette. But why was all this attention and money being spent on an aging war hero that was not even a native citizen? Quite simply, Lafayette was one of the last remaining founding fathers. In celebrating Lafayette the man, the people of the United States were not just celebrating the accomplishments of the man but also the American ideals of liberty. Furthermore, the very fact that Lafayette was not a native son endeared him to the American people because he risked his life not to protect his native land, but out of a genuine love for freedom and democracy. Lafayette's visit was a chance for the American people to once again remember the sacrifices of the past and the ultimate triumph of democratic ideals."],"display_date":"October 19, 1824 - October 27, 1824","search_date":"1824-10-23","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3647,"title":"The Portsmouth Fire of 1821\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-03-21","end_date":"1821-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At around 2:45 a.m. on the morning of Wed., March 21, 1821, a fire broke out in the kitchen of a vacant tenement on the corner of Main and Market Streets in Portsmouth, Virginia. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> of Friday, March 23 reported that owing to the violence of the wind, which was blowing at the time a perfect gale from S. S. W., and the combustible nature of the buildings, the fire spread with uncontrollable rapidity to the market house and adjacent houses. After the fire had burned out, it was discovered that 30 to 40 homes and tenements had been totally destroyed by the blaze. This loss constituted a large portion of the small city."," Louisa Emmerson, a resident of Portsmouth at the time, included in her memoirs a description of the destruction. She wrote that most of the east side of Crawford Street was destroyed as well as portions of Queen and Water Streets. Ms. Emmerson surmised that the reason the west side of Crawford Street was spared was due to its width of one hundred feet, while the flames were able to leap across narrower streets such as Queen which had a width of only thirty feet. In addition to the destroyed buildings mentioned in the Herald, Ms. Emmerson wrote that the fire was also able to destroy three ships moored at the Portsmouth docks."," Both Emmerson and the Herald lauded the performance of the Norfolk fire companies and the U.S. Navy fire company for their quick response to the scene of the inferno. The timely response of the firefighters served to check the extension of the inferno and prevented the fire from spreading to the opposite sides of Market and Main Streets, thus saving the citizens of the city from any further damage. Finally, the Herald article speculated that the fire may have been the work of an arsonist, considering that the building in which it originated was uninhabited and the fact that only a few days prior an attempt had been made by some dark-plotting villain to fire the town in another direction by means of a bundle of matches and other combustibles wrapped around an iron spike the sharp point of which was driven into the weather-boarding of a small frame house-the fire was just communicating to the shingles of the roof when it was providentially discovered and extinguished."," In the days before electricity and oil or gas heat, fire was a constant household danger. A soot-filled chimney was a dangerous fire hazard, not to mention the open flames of oil lamps and candles. Additionally, all houses of the time were often built almost completely out of wood or with wooden interiors and brick outer shells. Quite simply, a person's house was a veritable tinderbox waiting to be consumed in a raging inferno. Not surprisingly, newspapers of the day, like the <em>Herald</em>, contained advertisements for so-called fire-proof brick dwellings, like the two-story Fire-proof brick tenement listed for sale in the November 10, 1819 edition. However fire-proof buildings were not the only fire-related advancements in the early nineteenth century. The fire insurance industry also sprang up in the wake of the rapid urbanization and industrialization that characterized the period."," It is interesting to note the influence that fire companies had in controlling the Portsmouth blaze and preventing its further spread. Like the population and economy of the United States, the number of municipal fire departments grew in the early nineteenth century. With the addition of new technologies and better equipment, these fire companies began to increase the effectiveness with which they fought fires. Inventors began to make careers out of designing all sorts of fire equipment from hoses, ladders, and clothing to pumps and engines that could propel water distances of 180 feet. The early nineteenth century also saw the birth of a nationwide fire department tradition that has been maintained to this day: the fireman's parade. A parade was a way for the citizens to honor the fire departments who had done so much for their community as well as a way for the department to show off their equipment and manpower. In an era where structure fires had the potential to level entire cities, a good fire company was invaluable to the community."],"display_date":"March 21, 1821","search_date":"1821-03-21","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3651,"title":"Improvements to the Dismal Swamp Canal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-11-17","end_date":"1819-11-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 17, 1819, the Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald rejoiced in reporting the news that the new and improved Dismal Swamp Canal was nearing completion and was soon to be ready for traffic. The Canal was undergoing a process of deepening and widening so that it could accommodate the traffic of larger vessels. To the Herald, the traffic on the Dismal Swamp Canal was the lifeblood of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, to whom their very existence depended. The improvements to the Canal were slowed by winter weather and heavy late summer rains, but by November the Canal was once again filled with Boats incessantly passing and repassing, laden with the produce of the country, or with foreign merchandize, present[ing] a continued scene of industry and activity as far as the eye can reach, and impress[ing] the mind of the beholder with a clear conception of the importance of this great commercial thoroughfare.","The Dismal Swamp is a great expanse of soggy land comprising over 100,000 acres in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Though early settlers realized the land was practically useless for farming, it was bestowed with another valuable resource: timber. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington formed the Dismal Swamp Company with the intention of digging a canal into the interior of the swamp so that this resource could be better utilized. The canal he constructed was a small one and it became to be known as Washington's Ditch. Later, Washington's Canal was replaced by wider and deeper waterways. The canal was important to the economy of the region because of the timber it transported out of the swamp as well as the produce that traveled through the swamp from North Carolina on its way to Norfolk and Suffolk, Virginia. The goods that were transported on the Dismal Swamp Canal were vital to the economy of eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia.","The 1820s saw an explosion of canal building in the United States of which the Dismal Swamp Canal was a part. Along with the Erie Canal and the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, the Dismal Swamp Canal was seen as an important economic link between the coast and the interior. As well as providing coastal markets for interior goods, these canals also served to connect states and regions in commerce, accelerating the economic growth of the period. Finally, these waterways were often the proving grounds for new technologies like the steamboat. In all, canals like the Dismal Swamp Canal factored greatly in the economic and technological development of the young nation."],"display_date":"November 17, 1819","search_date":"1819-11-17","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3679,"title":"Debate Over State Debt\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-03-24","end_date":"1871-03-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Why should Virginians have to bear the entire debt? Zephaniah Turner raised this question repeatedly before the House of Delegates in Richmond. In the eyes of Turner, West Virginians were just as responsible for payment as Virginians, seeing as how the debt had existed before dismemberment of the state. Turner blasted Virginia's political representatives for rattling on about preserving honor when their priority should have been to prevent burdening the state's citizens with enormous taxes. When the people discover the unjust tax plans, Turner exclaimed, they would run out the current leaders and elevate to their places others who have less sublimated ideas of honor and fame and the past, and more practical ones as to the present and future."," In the aftermath of the Civil War, Virginia faced a significant economic hurdle-- a public debt of approximately 45 million. Although the debt, initially used to fund transportation initiatives like railroads and canals, started out as 33 million prior to war, the amount had swelled to its present state. Debates ensued over how to pay this sum. Since the westernmost counties of Virginia had only established the new state of West Virginia in 1863, some, like Turner, argued that the debt belonged to West Virginia as well and thus Virginians were not legally bound to pay anything. However, the main controversy of 1871 became whether Virginia should fund its entire debt plus interest or pay at a readjusted (reduced) level. This battle catalyzed the formation of two factions, the Funders and the Readjusters."," In 1871 the state government passed the Funding Act. This legislation pledged Virginia to pay the debt in full, marking the state as the only southern postwar government to fund its debt at such a high rate. As rationale, Funders pointed to the importance of saving the honor of Virginia, although additional motivation came from the fact that many were looking to profit from their state bonds. The Funders' decision eventually proved to be a strain for Virginia as it exhausted the state of its revenues and forced it to borrow just to continue operating its government. Leaders also severed funding for social services such as asylums, encouraged skyrocketing property taxes, and enforced new taxation on items such as dogs and liquor consumption. In addition, although constitutional requirements demanded the state to assume most of the cost of the new public school system, the Funders instead chose to shut down half of its schools, citing public education as a luxury.

According to an ordinance passed on September 8, 1873, no vehicle of any kind was allowed to traverse that specific lane, the most important and populous street of the city. The F&P Railroad Company, on the other hand, charged that when Richmond chartered the company in 1834, the city specifically granted the company's directors the power to place whatever vehicles they deemed necessary on the railroads. The court eventually ruled in favor of Richmond, deciding that the city's inherent right to guard the safety and welfare of its citizens did not violate any contract between Richmond and the F&P Railroad Company."," In the Reconstruction-era South, railroads played a prominent role, expanding in number (mileage doubled in the years from 1865 to 1880) while functioning as a symbol for urban development and economic growth.

By the time of the case, however, Broad Street had become a site of many retail businesses and served as a bustling tourist site. "," At the same time, railroad companies suffered their share of critics. Many felt that the railroads exploited their lack of supervision to act like institutions beyond the reach of legislatures or courts. For example, railroads often charged excessively high fees, but denounced suggestions of rate regulations as violations of private property rights. In the Richmond vs. the F&P Railroad Company case, the railroad tried to convince the judge that its charter cemented a right by contract forever, and under all circumstances, to run its cars by steam, thereby exempting the company from any form of city regulatory laws.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics. Jackson, against the bank for ideological reasons, fought to defeat it. He removed the bank deposits, effectively killing the bank in 1834. Directly as a result of this, the Whig Party formed in opposition to Jackson. John C.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time.

Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3701,"title":"Gold deposits within Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-05","end_date":"1859-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gold What could be more illustrious to read about during the mid nineteenth century than gold? On March 9, 1859, the Farmer's Cabinet published an article briefly summarizing one man's visit to the sub-treasury gold reserve in Washington, D.C. In a seemingly obvious attempt to bolster national comfort and ease economic pessimist, the lure of gold and more importantly a surplus of gold available in the sub-treasury gave the reader the feeling that though times seemed bleak, there was enough gold in this town to support half the world for life. The Panic of 1857 was a sudden downturn in the economy caused by, among other things, the decision of British investors to remove funds from U.S. banks for fear of economic instability. Beginning in 1848, the California Gold Rush ushered in millions of dollars in gold to many different treasury deposits such as the one located in the city of Washington. Many news outlets following the Panic chose to run stories such as this one to bring about a feeling of national economic security that would ease investors.The author described the sight of a piece of golden cheese worth nearly a quarter of a million U.S. dollars. As the Gold Rush progressed and the rich got richer, local banks and gold dealers issued banknotes in exchange for gold, private mints created private gold coins, and gold was sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the thriving California financial system.   Herbert Brayer even went as far as to say that overnight California became the Mecca of America, shipping assets and wealth domestically as well as across the globe. The ramifications of the discovery of gold in California were incredible: towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives were sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.The brightest light shed from the account is that which is seen at the Sub-Treasury in Washington where the author describes the everything-proof bunker, which is filled on all sides with Solid Bars of gold and silver. The author concludes his journey in a very calculating way, forcing the reader to step forth from this cave of wealth and back to the real world. Though the sight of the illustrious gold was gone, the lasting vision of available security and wealth illustrated by the author and Brayer's assessment remains engraved in the readers mind forever. One could even make the argument that booster articles like this one were the reason for the sharp economic recovery that followed the Panic of 1857."],"display_date":"March 5, 1859","search_date":"1859-03-05","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3702,"title":"Prospectus for 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-12-13","end_date":"1849-12-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the antebellum period newspapers frequently published editorials that prophesized the events to come. These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time. Though many of the penny press' so called prospectuses did shed some insight on the future to come, they also had an ambivalent side with predictions so vague that they easily could have some aspects of truth.

Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

Many rumors circulated about secret deals with foreign countries in exchange for economic and Republican support. One particular rumor published in an article from the Farmer's Cabinet concerned the possibility of a United States acquisition of all Nicaraguan lands in exchange for help establishing a firm and stable government. The authors pre-disposition against the British was quite apparent as the author went so far as to blame them for creating a treaty with Nicaragua to debunk the United States' plans for expansion into Latin America. This geopolitical chess game is not an unfamiliar scene in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were many occasions when it was rumored that Washington had already worked out plans with a foreign nation only to discover later that such a possibility could never exist. Only a few weeks after this article was published, the Panama Railway opened, becoming the first railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The influence of articles like the one from the Farmer's Cabinet helped to keep Washington in check.

The paper gave no description of the desired monument, but gave bountiful detail of the great deeds and history of John Lewis and his family.  Lewis came from Ireland, and, according to tradition, brought red clover to the continent.  The Indians attributed this red color to the blood that the Lewis family spilled from the Indians they frequently fought.  The article expounded Lewis's heroism, durability, and courage.  Lewis had a simple tombstone that proclaimed him a true patriot, especially for producing five sons who fought in the Revolutionary War.  The proposed monument, according to the article, would serve as his resting place in Gypsy Hill Park.  The article concentrated on Lewis, but also provided many details of his father's and grandfather's roles in Europe.  Because Lewis had such a large family, the paper suggested that surviving direct descendants would gather for the ceremonies.  ","    <em>The Washington Post </em>ran this article with the subheading of The Romance of a Virginian, surely catching the eye of the readers.  This piece is filled with history, romance, war, and action.  A reader wanting a trip into the past or out of the city and into the country could find it in this article.  A reader also wanting to know of heroes before the Civil War would find this article less taxing. The fact that the paper does not describe the monument at all suggests that the monument is either very unattractive or boring, or that there were no plans yet for it. ","    After the United States had settled down to a degree from the Civil War, commemorative statutes and memorials building occurred. Kirk Savage has noted an that during the nineteenth century, people increasingly built commemorative monuments to preserve and possibly redefine memories and the past.  He argues that people felt the need to control the past and memories, and thus built monuments to portray what they believed and felt, even if the perceptions were not fully truthful.  The Staunton people wanted the correct and proper portrayal of the story for the founding of their city.  Though John Lewis had died long before, he had lived his life fighting for what he had believed and had descendants who fought for their rights.  Lewis was the type of hero that Augusta County wanted.  Having died long before the Civil War meant the County did not have to deal with the pain of the Civil War and task of properly honoring a man who fell in a war that defeated the South.  There was no problem of strong emotional ties or recent wounds.  Anyone in the North or the South could be proud of this man because they had no need to tie him to the present.  Building a monument to John Lewis and not one of the many Augusta County soldiers who died gave the County a past they could all respect and upon which they could agree. There would be no debate on whether Lewis was a Democrat or Republican, secessionist or Unionist.  John Lewis was a man for America and that was all the County needed.

Not only did the city have electricity, but also they had streetlights on some of the main streets. They had a telegraph since the 1850's, but did not mention it, nor did they mention their railroad connections. Not only did the citizens of Staunton enjoy these technological advances, they had a strong arts program. The citizens enjoyed the finest Opera House in the State of Virginia and the largest and best band of music in the South. A troupe from New York even traveled to Staunton to perform, and during travel one of its members met her death in a train accident in the city and the show was cancelled. "," The newspaper featuring this article was not widely circulated and a news wire would not have any reason to pick up this story and publish it nationally. There were plenty of other cities just like Staunton in the United States and nothing special about the technology there, but the arts might have been. They had the telephone and failed to mention their railroad connections, but it had been there since the 1850's and had become such a part of everyday life in so many other areas that it was not unique to Staunton. They did not have to boast of their railroad because it was assumed that a great city like theirs would have a railroad. Space in the paper might have limited the lauding of the city, or there was nothing left to praise. The article mattered to the inhabitants though and could only have fostered their sense of accomplishment. "," Edward Ayers has noted Augusta County's position as a border state before the Civil War. Its position in the Great Valley created connections in the North and in the South. The Valley Turnpike provided direct access northward for everything. After the War, Augusta had the same geographic location, but a different mindset because the country held a different attitude. It enjoyed the economic prosperity that the railroads and other technology had brought, but the city was a Southern city at heart. The citizens had a relationship with the South and its customs but there was a constant exchange of ideas, people, and products with the North, too. They could not ignore the stories of Northern events in their newspapers or the information a traveler on the B&O brought from Cincinnati. The Northern influence was strong, but so was that of the South. The Virginia Central Railroad connected the cities in Virginia and strengthened the Southern hold. It is important to note that in the late 1880's when the North and South were separating culturally, the city boasted of their opera house and band in relation to the South. This statement was a sign to the readers that the citizens of Staunton still firmly held their connection to the South, even if they used technological inventions that held greater prominence in the North.

The day was filled with an atmosphere of goodwill and entertainment.  According to the local newspaper, <em>The Spectator</em>, upon arrival at the excursion's destination \"[t]he day was pleasantly spent in amusements and games of different kinds-ten pins, croquet, dancing, &c.\"  Such activity was a relatively common feature of the temperance movement in the American South after the Civil War.  The main goal of this movement was to eliminate, or at least reduce, alcohol consumption among the populace.  According to historian Thomas Pegram, the movement was filled largely with women who often engaged in public, grassroots activities to spread their message.  Lacking the right to vote and often appealing to the idea that they were the moral authority on the domestic scene, such women saw public action as an important way to express their ideals.","      Other broad trends in the post-Civil War South contributed to increased emphasis on temperance.

Many saw temperance as a step toward advancing the South into modernity.

Such ads for girl's academies were not uncommon in the 1830s, for over the span of the early 1800s there was a growing trend for families to send their daughters to one of these schools if they could afford it. The popularity of these academies is best explained by the belief in the early 1800s that a good education was instrumental in preparing an upper class woman for her role in society and at home. Among the courses offered in the ad were \"French and English Languages, Sacred and Profane History, Ancient and Modern Geography, Mythology, and all the various types of Fancy and Ornamental Needlework.\" Such fields of study were common among these academies, although there were variances from school to school. The inclusion of needle work in the curriculum, however, is a bit uncommon, for although it was an important skill for most women in the antebellum period it was only taught in about thirty-percent of academies. In addition, courses in music and dance were offered in the ad but at an extra cost. This highlighted a common trend in the academy movement. While these fields were thought to be an important part of creating a lady, they lost value with a newer emphasis on more academic courses which had previously been for males only. Christie Farnham, in her <em>Educating the Southern Belle</em>, argues that this change occurred because of the changing ideas of the capacities of women. Because women were now thought to be just as capable as men they too could receive the same benefits of a liberal arts education as men did. And this was the main point of a woman's education, to make her a better person for her role in society. Thus, the knowledge gained in schooling was important in creating what was thought to be a proper lady."," In addition to the knowledge gained, a proper education was pivotal in creating a charming and sophisticated lady. And this highlighted an important role of a woman's education, as a sign of class distinction. One of the most prominent ways in which the upper-class distinguished itself from lower classes was with the refinement and knowledge gained from these institutions. It reinforced the idea that they were better than the people in these other groups by virtue of their knowledge and ability to interact in proper society. Such an ideal is played upon in the ad as when it states, \"Advantage will be taken of every opportunity to cultivate their minds, and qualify them for refined and polite society.\" Thus, in many respects a young ladies education was a defining symbol of her class status. Also, an education became a sign of class rank simply because of its immense cost. Tuitions were usually around 200 annually but could range much higher,  the ad's tuition is listed at the exorbitant price of 500, and this did not include other expenses such as clothing, transportation, extra classes, and so on.

He proposed the construction of a huge public park that would \"be enjoyed by thousands of all classes, without distinction.\"  The ideals of Romanticism and the Republican view of the importance of nature were at a peak among educated Americans at this time and this commentator proposed a way to manifest these ideals.  New York City, being the largest city as well as the informational center, certainly had many who supported the idea that nature should be valued and used respectfully to enrich one's mind and refresh one's spirit.  From these beliefs arose the idea for the creation of a huge park to be enjoyed by all the citizens of New York City.  This journalist, in <u>The Horticulturist, and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste</u>, was one of the first to publish his opinions on the issue and explain the beginnings of such a park.  He criticized New York for not having enough open public spaces, and emphasized the Republican idea that nature is closely linked with virtue and comparing New York to cities in Europe, most of which had public parks.  The mayor of New York at the time, Ambrose Kingsland, had recently proposed 160 acres for a park.  This proposal was the first of its kind in America for park of such large scale, but the writer condemned this as being too small.  He suggested a 500 acre plot of land between the Harlem River and 39th, land that is in fact today part of Central Park.   Although this author's passionate essay on the importance of establishing a large park brought no immediate action, it marked the beginning of a huge public interest in such an endeavor.  Two years later, in 1853, there were still only 143 acres out of New York's 14,000 dedicated to public spaces, including cemeteries.  Many later authors continued the journalist's argument; one enumerated the reasons why such a park was a necessity for the city, being a haven for health, recreation, and driving and riding.  The park's approval and design finally took form in the late 1850's.  The proposal for Central Park had a huge impact on New York City as well as the patterns of urban development across the country."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":8924,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3905,"title":"Improvement and Success in the Railroad System of Western Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-01-01","end_date":"1892-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    Successful transportation had finally arrived On January 6, 1892 the first article on the front page of The Daily Virginian, under the heading \"Local Matters,\" spoke of the Lynchburg citizens' excitement regarding the success of their railway service and the current development of western Virginia railroad systems.  The previous morning, railroad workers had started running the engines of the cars before it had begun to snow, yet the tracks were already frozen with a \"sheet of hard frozen sleet.\"  This situation would normally have caused a huge problem even in Richmond and Norfolk; however, because of recent improvements in the railway system and the car's standard motor and double gearing, however, the problem did not exist in Lynchburg.  The first car was easily able to move at a quick speed and remove all impediments on the track.  Not only did it clear the path successfully, but also made it possible for other trains to run safely for the entire day.  The article stated that the system had not only been improving drastically for the past two months, but also that shortly all the cars would be equipped with the double gearing, making the Lynchburg and western Virginia railway system would be \"second to none.\"","    The reason for this strong success in the railroad system was because of the recent purchase of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company by the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies.  While the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies took indirect control of the Shenandoah Valley Company in 1883, improvements were slow, and because of bad tracks and still uneven tracks, profits hit an all-time low.  Money intake increased, and this final purchase in1890 was the key to success.   The new owners had a strict development policy and were attempting to improve the lines for the general welfare of the people and the growth progress of their towns.  This new and improved system meant a safe and successful route from Washington D.C. to Tennessee, encompassing many important counties in western Virginia.  Consequently, the Lynchburg newspaper had articles like the previous one as well as many comments made by citizens of the town in the \"Items of Interest\" section about their excitement for easy and safe travel as well as future growth of industrialization in their counties.  More specifically, almost every day The Daily Virginian reported the increasing profits of the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies.  The people were proud of both the improvement of the railroad system and the growing development of their western proportion of Virginia, and were excited to talk about it frequently in their newspaper. ","    These same developments were occurring all throughout the South in the early 1890s as well.  While railroads had been prevalent for many decades, they were never completely safe and successful.  Because of the multitude of railroad companies, tracks were uneven, times were uncoordinated, and wrecks were frequent.  However, the post-Reconstruction period brought a time when the railroads could improve not only in large cities, but also in the less populated counties throughout the southern states.  In Lynchburg and surrounding counties, the Norfolk and Western Railroad companies attempted and later succeeded in doing this exact thing. Essentially, the railroad made it possible for Lynchburg and other small towns in western Virginia to further industrialize and grow in many ways that they were incapable of doing before.

The city left a mark on Flagler and he returned in March of 1885 just in time for St. Augustine's annual Ponce de Leon celebration.  Each year the city of St. Augustine would put on a great pageant to celebrate the landing of Ponce de Leon in Florida.

Of no exception to this national excitement was the up and coming southern town of Atlanta, Georgia where the citizens excitedly prepared for the centennial celebration.  The Atlanta Constitution documented this significant event in the history of the country as it took place in a small southern city, offering a glimpse not only into the patriotic celebrations of the nineteenth century but also into the development of American nationalism in the post-bellum South.  ","A town experiencing much change and growth in 1876, Atlanta had begun to recover from the obscurity of its ante-bellum existence and the destruction wrecked upon it during the Civil War. Assuming a more prominent role in the South, Atlanta had begun to become a hub of commerce and information due mostly to the railroad expansion and development in the area. By 1876, the Atlanta Constitution had earned a considerable reputation by acquiring several new editors including Henry Grady who would later propel the city into the national spotlight. In addition to the tangible changes Atlanta had experienced was the ideological development of a southern town towards the end of Reconstruction. Worthy of note is Franklin Garret's description in his book on Atlanta about how the town was still jaded by the Civil War, an emotion that complicated the city's attitude towards national holidays. Despite this sentiment and not wanting to be outdone, the Constitution describes how the citizens of Atlanta formed committees to plan parties and organize a celebration of memorable proportions for the centennial Fourth of July.","As the momentous day of jubilee approached and anticipation began to grow around the country, congress passed a resolution encouraging widespread festivity for the Fourth of July. Setting the tone for a nation wide celebration, this resolution was sent to all the different states, including Georgia. Governor Smith received the resolution which was subsequently printed in the Constitution on April 26, 1876. The fact that such a resolution was published in the Constitution and that it set the tone for the celebrations to come speaks of Atlanta's changing sentiment towards American nationalism and mirrors its growth from a small southern town into a national city. ","The tempo set and the parties planned, Atlanta was ready to celebrate.  According to the Atlanta Constitution, a large party was planned to be held at the Irish Literary Association building which was located at the intersection of Whitehall and Peters Street. The paper calls for the general public to \"lend their help toward making this celebration of this centennial Fourth a memorable occasion.\" According to the Constitution of July 6, the party was such a success that \"several hundred had to turn away\" because there was not enough room. The decorations were \"beautiful\" and extravagant, and all in all the tone and atmosphere of the occasion was one of national unity. To that end, a portrait of George Washington was prominently displayed along with an exhibit of arms that symbolized peace and unity between the North and the South in post-Civil War America. Not only was the celebration in Atlanta a huge hit that drew large numbers and extensive news coverage, it was also a success in that it was a celebration of national unity in a region that had recently undergone great turmoil and destruction."],"display_date":"July 4, 1876","search_date":"1876-07-04","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4301,"title":"Godeys Ladys Book, More than Fashion","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1898-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Louis A. Godey's enormously successful <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> set the standard for the American magazine and monthlie publishers throughout the mid 19th century.  His ingenious marketing techniques as noted by historian John Tebbel set the standard for magazines by 1850.  The market appeal of <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> contributed to the rising realization that women were a marketable audience and Louis Godey's brainchild spurned the rise of a wave of impersonators such as <em>Peterson's Ladies</em> and <em>Ladies' Wreath</em>.  The magazines greatest contribution was to the evolution of fashion and its careful documentation of the latest styles.  As a result of increased subscriptions, the transformation of the monthlie to the magazine took place in order to sell more copies and increase profit; Godey's Lady's Book was one of the last to convert into a true magazine as Louis Godey preferred his original creation to the new low quality productions.  The method of payment for contributors was also unique to Godey's enterprise at first; Godey would not pay undistinguished writers for their contributions as his magazine would likely launch an unknown into fame.  Godey would then pay well known authors such as Nathaniel Willis a hefty paycheck to write regular entries that readers came to expect.  Another cost cutting revolution that Godey exploited was the use of advertisements which served two purposes; the initial being that he had a subsidized product, and his readers had a seemingly \"larger\" magazine to read.  As one of the first magazines to use advertisements, Godey risked making his publishment appear to be cheap; but by not lowering the price it made the magazine keep its' glamorous appeal.  The <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> employed the same strategy as well for several years prior to the Civil War.","                Not only did the structure of the modern magazine gain inspiration from Godey but so too did the content matter.  The most important subject piece that historian look to now for insight into the period are the hand tinted fashion plates that accompanied each issue of the magazine.  Carefully detailed and researched, these plates were to provide an image to the reader of how she should look in the latest fashionable dress.  Godey claimed in 1850 that he had 150 women working out of their homes to paint by hand these fashion plates, and the color was often left to the artists' decision.  This played off well for Godey by explaining that then readers should compare each others' fashion plates and decide then what color would be best for the clothing.  By comparing the fashion plates over the years, the evolution of women's dress can be traced throughout the 18th century from <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em>.  Additionally the fashion plates became more expansive through the decades, indicating more interest in fashion due to cheaper and more readily available clothing to buy.  ","The subjects contained in Godey's Lady's Book were also revolutionary in its inclusion of fiction in the form of short stories.  Authors such as Edgar Allen Poe got early starts in their early careers by writing short pieces for Godey's Lady's Book and reached a large audience.  Louis Godey realized as well that a magazine was not just a literary journal and as such should provide the reader a diverse array of subject material.  As a result women across the country were provided the latest monthly updates on music, dance, politics, and art; each copy complete with engravings, paintings, and eventually photos.  The use of artwork and pictures to compliment the literature was a transformative concept that became the norm for magazines by 1850.  Such techniques caused Godey's Lady's Book to become so successful that Godey copyrighted the magazine in 1845 in an attempt to prevent duplications.  ","                The Civil War marked the decline of the magazine market for several years simply due to the loss of consumers; the South made up the majority of Godey's customers.  By the time of Godey's death in 1878, his namesake was nearly in the same condition.  Even copying other magazines \"ten cent\" strategy in 1893 worked to no avail and the magazine finally ceased to exist in 1898.  <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> impact on the magazine industry helped to transform pleasure reading in 19th century America by establishing the standard format for magazines."],"display_date":"January 1, 1830 - January 30, 1898","search_date":"1864-01-16","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4311,"title":"Boston&#39;s Predicament: Women in the City\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-18","end_date":"1889-08-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["According to the Boston Daily Globe of August 18, 1889, \"Too Good to Lose Are Boston's Surplus Women.\" This article pertains to a matter of utmost importance, the eligible bachelors of the Wild West heroically discovering a solution for the \"marriageable femininity\" and the \"confoundly delicate matter\" of the over 80,000 surplus of women in Massachusetts. Belle Eyre even reports that these men are so \"self-sacrificing that they would solve the problem by marrying the whole 80,000.\" Belle Eyre also graciously published a letter, in the form of a poem, from ten dressmakers sending their solitude to the gentlemen of Tacoma Washington for the \"lovely life in that far-off part of this great and glorious land,\" and promising to \"Olympia there, ere summer does close,\" all with the post script \"We are all white women.\" ","Perhaps, though, the real heart of the matter comes towards the end of Belle Eyre's investigation when Gov. Andrew of Oregon expressed his views on the matter. Should women be \"driven to the competition of the market force with men, or where men are left unsolaced by the presence of women, society is alike weakened and demoralized.\" Hence, should men continue to desire their place at the head of the households, they should take immediate action to curb this surplus of women, should these women get out of hand and act rashly, such as trying to secure their right to vote, or other such nonsense. Hon. M. M Cunniff says though he doubts there actually is any danger of a surplus of women in Massachusetts, he should be glad for there to be double their present number. In fact, he adds, he would willingly give women \"greater opportunities than they have now,\" but he doubts this is what they actually wants; he sees their personal missions as producing \"men, not measures.\" ","Sarah Deutsch, in her book Women in the City: Gender, Space and Power in Boston, 1870-1940, finds women's roles in Boston in the late 19th century to be quite different than Belle Eyre's account. She discovers that Boston women, in fact, were not merely passive women, looking for domestic roles and adventure out west as mothers and wives, but active women who deeply cared about staking a claim in their male-dominated city. These women insisted upon creating an urban space that could meet their needs as individuals, in a society, which historically, denied these interests. Through her accounts of women through all socioeconomic stratifications, Deutsch expresses how these women formed female associations, overcame ethnic and racial diversity, expanded all conventional boundaries, advocated for playgrounds and settlement houses, and crossed all gender boundaries to create their own city in the spirit of \"urban femininity.\" Deutsch's study of Boston, M.A. throughout this pivotal time period, displays a character of the Boston women who, unlike Belle Eyre's account in the Boston Globe, chose to invest their faith and determination within their city, to create a modern city that could, in deed, meet the needs of a gender whose opportunity for equality and respect had finally come.

According to the New York Times in July of 1888, there was \"a vast army of men and women and a few children in New York engaged in making clothes.\" Historically, the clothes industry had undergone many tariff protections. For instance, all the parts of a woman's dress or a man's suit were \"protected\" by astronomical tariffs: on such items as \"raw wool, the cotton yarn, the print cloth, the thread, the buttons, linings, trimmings and woolen cloth.\" The article, \"Clothes Makers and the Tariff,\" argued for the Mill Bill, a bill that would allow for laborers to enjoy higher wages and, consequently, a better and cheaper standard of living. This piece of legislation hoped to encourage these positive alterations by making wool \"free,\" like cotton, which already enjoyed freedom from large duties. ","    In 1888, cotton's rate of duty was approximately 40 percent, compared to the 69 percent experienced by the wool industry. The New York Times discovered that this increase in duty did not benefit the wage earners. Instead, it merely added to the profits of the companies. Meanwhile, there were large numbers of people smuggling foreign goods into the country, which only further increased the problems instilled by the current duty. The Mill Bill hoped to take positive actions to \"excel\" in the worldwide clothing manufacturing market, a foreign idea in the \"cloth making business\" in the late 19th century. Instead, countries such as England dominated in these areas because of the United States' high duties. ","    The factories, which should have been filled with the \"music of contented labor,\" were instead filled with the miserable sounds of the \"poverty-stricken.\" The introduction of the Mill Bill would allow factories to become happier places, with lower costs to the manufacturer and lower costs of materials. With the reduction of duties as proposed by this bill, the United States and New York City would be able to compete with foreign competitors, have happier employees, and extend the clothing market. ","    The sentiments expressed through both this article and the Mill Bill were supported by the women and the Democrat Party's campaign throughout 1888 and 1892. Women worked in these clothing factories in an 11:1 ratio of females to males, and shopping and consumerism had continually become a female duty. The Democratic Party and the tariff reform movement involved both working-class women and middle-class women, whose voices strove to be heard through the ballots of their husbands. The Democratic Party employed moral arguments for economic reforms as Democratic women argued that these tariffs were stealing incomes from hard-working families, and they blamed the Republicans for this insanity. Through reforms such as the tariff reform, women gained their political voice as they marched their husbands to the ballot boxes. As reported by the Woman's Tribune, \"political parties [began] to take note of what will be women's wish.\" In the 1890 election, women's influence and the tariff issue seemed to dominate the Democrat's \"sweeping victories,\" as women gained political power through the ballots of their men and under the pretext of tariff reform and legislation, such as the Mill Bill.

The article continued to claim, \"the value of such sanitary care was particularly tested in 1878, when the disease was very fatal in Memphis, Shreveport, and in Texas.\" In the wake of numerous epidemics of yellow fever, cholera, and the like, people throughout the country called for sanitary reform and regulation. The rapid urbanization experienced during the nineteenth century had highlighted the insufficient methods for disposing of waste and refuse. As exclaimed in the <em>New York Daily Times</em>: \"we need nothing but noses to know that there is something rotten in the street.\"","The initial push for sanitary reform came in the 1840s, yet would not culminate in any significant changes until the 1870s and 1880s. In the early stages of urban development, city-dwellers practiced private-lot waste removal, in which, as Peterson describes, they \"discharged their wastes upon the land adjoining their dwellings and shops, principally within the confines of the private lot but also into the streets.\" In reaction to similar problems in England during the 1840s, British reformer Edwin Chadwick developed an innovative system of water-carriage sewerage, in which pressurized water was passed through small, egg-shaped pipes to carry solid wastes away from the city. Chadwick also accepted the filth theory, which held \"that gases or miasmas emanating from decaying organic matter caused disease.\" However, not much progress was made in sanitary reform in America before the Civil War; as Peterson remarks, \"only Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Chicago, in fact, attempted major works before the Civil War. Not until after the war and the return of cholera in 1866 did many cities introduce systematic sewerage.\" At that point, American pioneers followed Chadwick's suit, installing comprehensive and integrated sewer systems in major cities across the nation. Legislation was passed to provide for the administrative reform of sanitation. Boards of Health began cropping up in cities around the country. The American Public Health Association, which Peterson claims, \"became the principal voice of American sanitary reform,\" was formed in 1872. Sanitary survey planning emerged as a useful practice, as it \"required the study of every street, lot, and building in a city to determine the precise location of any prevalent and all suspect environmental conditions.\"     ","The impact of American sanitary reform was most readily observed in the comprehensive reconstruction plan developed for Memphis, Tennessee in response to a devastating yellow fever epidemic in 1878, which claimed 5,150 lives out of its population of approximately 45,000. A National Board of Health was created in March 1879 to deal with the problem. It conducted an exhaustive, citywide survey and made nine proposals to improve the city's sanitation. George E. Waring was chosen to construct an innovative and controversial sewage system in the city. According to the <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>, Waring's \"pipes were much smaller than customary, were for house sewage only, without manholes, well ventilated, and were flushed every twenty-four hours by means of automatic flush tanks.\" Although the plan only pertained to health matters and not to the city's future growth, the sanitary reform conducted in Memphis considerably improved the city's sanitation and proved to be a significant step towards the eventual practice of city planning. ","However, in the 1880s and 1890s, German and French bacteriologists soon discovered the microscopic pathogenic organisms responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera, among others. Peterson states, \"As this new public health approach gradually took hold, it shifted attention away from the root premise of sanitary reform - that most infectious disease had its source in the visible environment.\" Thus, preventative measures such as isolation, immunization, disinfection, and antitoxins became more important than sanitary reform. Sanitary scientists developed methods of filtration and chlorination of water, allowing polluted water to become purified. Although sanitary reform eventually lost momentum in the face of microorganisms and filtration, the movement sparked valuable innovations in sewerage and city planning as methods to control the byproducts of urbanization during the nineteenth century.

A drawing of the \"new\" convent shows an elaborate building with elements of classical architecture consisting of a three story convent, orphanage and chapel. Designed by architectural firm Gurlie and Guillot, the convent was decorated with galleries, columns, and Baroque ornamentation. Facing the Mississippi river, it rivaled many of the surrounding plantation homes in both size and construction. ","Before the Ursuline nuns relocated to this new convent from their previous location in the middle of the French Quarter, they had been an important presence in the city of New Orleans for almost a century. They arrived from France in 1727 to establish a school for girls in what was then a French colony. They provided an education not only for white girls of the colony, but also for slaves, free girls of color, and Native American girls. In addition, the Ursulines ran an orphanage and a hospital. In the years immediately following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Ursuline nuns experienced several conflicts with both federal and city officials. One such conflict with the United States government concerning property ownership within the city, led the nuns to purchase property two miles outside New Orleans with the idea of moving. In 1819, the nuns experienced a different conflict: as New Orleans expanded, a closed off street going right through the convent compound had become an inconvenience to the public. In response, city officials decided to open this street to the public, despite protests from the Ursulines. This decision was what drove the nuns to sell some of their city property and to construct a new convent outside the city. The new location gave the nuns the ability to expand as well as the advantage of both being outside the jurisdiction of city officials and of being out of the way of city development.","The convent cost 83,172 to build, and the chapel was an additional 23,635, a total equivalent to about 2 million today. Emily Clark argues that by spending this much money to build an extravagant convent, the Ursuline nuns were making a statement as self-governing Catholic women in a Protestant country that valued a woman's submission to the authority of a husband. In an ironic repetition of the city's attempt to encroach on the nun's interests in favor of development, the 1824 convent was demolished in 1912 to make way for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal linking the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain. At this time, the Ursuline nuns again moved their convent and their school, both of which are still in operation."],"display_date":"March 25, 1823 - September 1, 1824","search_date":"1823-12-12","locations":[{"id":5595,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4423,"title":"Yellow Fever Responsible for Christian Miltenberger&#39;s Success in 19th Century New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-01","end_date":"1838-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Situated at the intersection of Royal and Dumaine Street in the heart of the New Orleans, the Miltenberger House still stands as a testimony to one immigrant's accumulation of wealth and to medical advancements in the South during the 19th century. ","Little was known about yellow fever, especially ways to prevent or treat this disease. Almost annually, it seemed, the Gulf Coast and in particular, New Orleans, suffered mass outbreaks of the fever and any aid that could be offered from doctors in surrounding areas was much appreciated. Municipal medical examiners in New Orleans were quick in issuing licenses to practice medicine to refugee doctors, including Christian Miltenberger. While during his time in St. Domingue, serving as a surgeon for a British garrison, Miltenberger treated many cases of yellow fever and was well equipped to handle the outbreaks in New Orleans. ","With his experience in dealing with yellow fever, the Mayor of New Orleans saw great potential in Miltenberger and appointed him to supervise indigent health care for the Mayor's district. Miltenberger also had the opportunity to present a paper before the Medical Society of New Orleans in 1819, theorizing that yellow fever was not a contagious disease, thus changing the understanding and reaction to the outbreaks of yellow fever.","With this great influence on the medical community came great reputation for Miltenberger. He was an active mason and served as president of a commission to raise funds for the construction of a Masonic hospital in the city of New Orleans. Miltenberger also acted on an opportunity to merge 120 acres of his property with 320 acres owned by Madame Joseph Bayle, creating a rather large sugar plantation just outside of New Orleans.

This ironic dichotomy was very evident amongst the upper class men of New Orleans, and it heavily influenced the future landscape of the city.  With a 'not in my backyard' view of prostitution, the wealthy males of New Orleans, although many were clients of prostitutes, did not want their homes and families near the lewd activities of the prostitution business.","The <em>Mascot</em>, a Louisiana newspaper, highlighted the effects of prostitution on the community, echoing the opinions of some New Orleanians.  The July 11, 1892 edition of the paper portrays the population's general fear of bordellos, depicting a family outside of their home, parents shielding the eyes of their children from the sight of the bordello next door.  With prostitution so prevalent, many did not want their families exposed to it.  Also, the wealthy citizens viewed nearby prostitution as a detriment not only to their families, but also their financial assets.  With prostitution in the neighborhood, residential property values dropped, causing a real concern for New Orleans' wealthy.","So, rather than trying to eliminate prostitution, the wealthy male political leaders instead accepted that, according to Louisiana historian Alecia Long, \"sins of the flesh were inevitable\" and \"gave [Satan] his own address.\"  The municipal government's first attempt to reduce areas of prostitution was with the Lorette Ordinances of 1857.  But, by 1897, many citizens, interested in preserving both the moral and property values of their neighborhoods, advocated for the gathering of the city's prostitutes into a more specific, much smaller district: Storyville.  The Story Ordinances turned a predominantly poor, African American part of town, away from the upper class neighborhoods, into the new home of sex.","The location of the official district of prostitution in 1897 truly revealed the magnitude of racial superiority and economic self-interest in New Orleans.  The impoverished African Americans of Storyville were a powerless group in the social hierarchy of power in New   Orleans.  Protesting the vice district's zoning was simply not an option as blacks in the city had no voice in politics.  But, local leaders often defended the Story Ordinances, citing that only one church and one school were within the new, smaller district, even though the church and school were predominantly black.  This action from the political leaders, Long implies, perpetuated a message that African Americans shared the same social status as prostitutes, \"both conceptually and in terms of physical proximity.\" Seeing blacks as immoral sexual beings was not an uncommon view in 19th century culture."],"display_date":"July 11, 1892 - December 31, 1897","search_date":"1895-04-06","locations":[{"id":5602,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4432,"title":"Legend of the Lafitte Brothers at 941 Bourbon Street \n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1810-01-01","end_date":"1823-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Once upon a time, two pirate brothers lived in the cottage at 941 Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The streets forming the Vieux Carre, or the old square, are the original streets of the city. William C. Davis explains that the names are \"redolent of [the] French and Spanish History.\" Historians acknowledge that this area prospered during the time of the Lafittes. Furthermore, the structure of the cottage is very emblematic of the French Colonial architectural style of the time period. The cottage is constructed with timbers of cypress, soft brick, and plaster. According to the historian Liliane Crete, the fact that the wood is cypress illustrates that \"the lowland of Louisiana was entirely covered with cypresses.\"","While 941 Bourbon Street is important because of its preservation of a historic style and time period, it is the brothers associated with it that solidify its historical importance and legendary quality. Many stories exist that tell of the Lafitte's blacksmith shop located on Bourbon Street and Saint Philip Street and the affairs, adventures, and trials of the brothers. The Lafitte brothers are very important to the history of New Orleans, particularly the slave trade. Many people in Louisiana wanted slaves, but several situations limited the supply, such as the embargo on importation of Africans into the United States. The Lafittes exploited the situation in order to become wealthy by providing slaves through illicit dealings when no one else could. They also became involved in many scandals and political situations.","Although legends, myths and other sources believe that the Lafittes lived or worked in the building, others argue the association. The author Barbara SoRelle Bacot believes, \"[941 Bourbon Street] is romantically known as Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, but it has nothing to do with Lafitte or any blacksmith.\"  She attributes the association to the nineteenth century writer George Washington Cable. Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence for either side, whether the Lafitte brothers truly built the structure is not what is important. 941 Bourbon Street is enlivened by the local legends of Pierre and Jean Lafitte and in turn has immortalized their legends in the region."],"display_date":"1810 - 1823","search_date":"1816-12-31","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4437,"title":"Fire Destroys Wall Street\n","course_id":17,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-12-16","end_date":"1835-12-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the evening hours of Wednesday, December 16, 1835, smoke billowed above the downtown Manhattan skyline.  At the time, no one knew exactly where the sparks had ignited and the fire begun, but by Thursday afternoon, the flames had engulfed approximately seventeen square blocks on and surrounding Wall Street. An article in the magazine The Albion indicated that by Thursday evening between 700 and 1000 buildings in the financial district, many only five or six years old, had been damaged.  Firefighters desperately attempted to extinguish the flames, but the unusually cold weather was accompanied by high winds.  As a result, flames quickly spread and water hoses froze, making the job near impossible.  Finally, fire companies chose to collect gunpowder from Navy Yards nearby and demolish buildings in the path of the fire to prevent it spreading to other parts of the city.","The final estimate suggested New Yorkers lost the equivalent of fifteen million dollars in private property during the fifteen hour fire. Insurance companies holding policies on many of the city's downtown buildings were ruined, some able to pay only twenty-five to fifty cents on the dollar in benefits.  Remarkably, shipping facilities along the river's banks remained safe from major damage.  Yet New York lay in ruins, and local officials sent in militias to protect against looting and damage over the coming weekend.  \"The arm of man was powerless…\" a journalist wrote, \"and many of our fellow citizens who retired to pillows in affluence, were bankrupts upon awaking.\"","New York had grown quickly in the early nineteenth century, and as the city expanded, fire companies, which had served as social clubs to many property owners in the past, now became associations for the poorer and much larger working classes of the American city.  Not only did these companies grow rapidly (some individual companies exceeding memberships of 300), but they became rallying points of community loyalty, oftentimes based on ethnicity. The result was fierce rivalry between the companies themselves.  In Philadelphia, for example, Irish Catholic and Irish Protestant companies raced horse-drawn hose carriages through the streets en route to a fire while in the process sabotaging one another's equipment, disabling truck wheels and cutting tow lines.  Competition between rival companies would often become so fierce that riots began.  In New York, as in Philadelphia, this trend only worsened as time went on, as some companies carried overlapping memberships with community gangs that could lead to further violence.  Naturally, these tensions directly related to the effectiveness of companies in extinguishing fires."],"display_date":"December 16, 1835 - December 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-16","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4438,"title":"Local Chinese React to Imperial Decree\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Americans think of Chinatown, they rarely associate it with New Orleans, but at the turn of the twentieth century, New Orleans was the only southern city with a population of Chinese immigrants significant enough to constitute a Chinatown.  Like other immigrants in America, the Chinese in New Orleans had to balance the ongoing connections and relationships back home with the opportunities presented in assimilating fully into the dominant American culture.  Unlike other immigrants, however, Chinese immigrants were barred from becoming citizens of the United States due to the Burlingame Treaty of 1868, and so felt a strong obligation to obey decrees and laws of their homeland.  On December 26, 1910, in the final days of the Qing Dynasty for instance, the provisional national assembly decreed that all citizens should cut off the traditional long braid, or queue.  On January 13, 1911, the New Orleans <em>Times-Democrat</em> reported that the Chinese population of New Orleans welcomed the decree because the braids were \"burdensome as well as troublesome.\" ","Around one fourth of New Orleans' Chinese immigrants, including prominent members of the community like Hom Kin, had already cut their queues by this time, and most Chinese had ceased wearing traditional Chinese attire.  Furthermore, with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricting the flow of new Chinese immigrants into New Orleans, the younger generation of Chinese-Americans within the city began to lose touch with their cultural heritage.  Kin's son, also queueless, expected \"to be more American in his ways than his Father,\" and American-born Chinese readily adopted the language, dress, and customs of the interracial neighborhoods of Chinatown.  ","Many Chinese immigrants lived in nearby interracial neighborhoods, though most worked in laundries located throughout the city.  According to period photographs and research conducted by Richard Campanella, the core of China\"town\" only consisted of a handful of shops, grocers, and restaurants along the 150 foot long 1100 block of Tulane   Avenue.  Several other Chinese establishments dotted the surrounding cityscape.  The district was popular with New Orleanians of all races and social classes, who ate at the restaurants, shopped at the stores and grocers, and took their clothes to the laundry mats.  They also compelled many Chinese immigrants to abandon their customs in order to attract more business, and, in turn, the distinct Chinese influence on Tulane Avenue slowly disappeared.

These \"sisters\" were a row of thirteen side-hall style town houses that spanned the 600 block of Julia Street in New Orleans.  Upon their construction by the New Orleans Building Company in 1833, they were among first rows constructed in the side-hall, or London-plan, manner most commonly seen in Philadelphia and Baltimore.  The exteriors combined traditional Creole features with emerging Greek revival design aspects to create a transitional style later mimicked by similar rows of houses.  Each doorframe consisted of a unique design of elaborate fanlights above the doors, ionic columns, and neoclassical infusions that created a unique look for each dwelling place amid the sea of red brick. Additionally, the Julia Street town houses were sold with a blank interior that attracted the wealthy who desired the flexibility to modify their own homes to best suite their needs and display their affluence.","Row houses provided one of most efficient housing solutions for urban areas like New Orleans because they maximized land use by utilizing a narrow lot.  The side-hall style offered a front gallery that joined the two main rooms and rear passageways that connected to narrower servants' quarters.  Such a design for the service wing offered a convenient housing solution for servants while maintaining the privacy of the homeowner.  Before the introduction of the row house, flat and raised French Creole cottages and cabins dominated the architecture of New Orleans, making the emergence of a new style desirable among the affluent who desired innovation.  Typical town houses consisted of between two and six units, giving the thirteen houses of Julia Row a distinctive architectural flair.  Each of the homes sold quickly at an auction in 1833 to members of the high society of New Orleans.  One home went to Henry Howard, the notable architect of the Howard Library and another to architect Henry Hobson Richardson.   The use of row houses continued to spread through New Orleans as a favorable residential plan, including famous rows like the Pontalba Apartments built in the 1850s.","Over time the sisters' glory faded as residential areas moved away from the American central business district and southwest into the Garden District.  Julia Row no longer offered the prestige and innovation desired by the elites and the homes were wrought with architecturally careless \"improvements\" made by neglectful owners who turned them into cheap boarding houses.  Cracks spanned across the face of the buildings, the servants' quarters deteriorated from lack of upkeep and one eventually collapsed entirely.  Recently, efforts have been made to restore what had become subpar property and create a high-end, artistic community teeming with art galleries and young energy.  The New Orleans City Planning Commission has been leading the gentrification endeavors to transform what had become the warehouse district into a neighborhood of museums and galleries to appeal to young artists, tourists, and history buffs.  The first to be revamped was at the corner of Julia and Camp Street, and the others quickly followed.  The Riverfront Streetcar also runs through the area booster visitation through providing easy access for both locals and tourists.

Beautiful women adorned the balconies that hung over the Place d' Armes. Each country, represented by its own amount of officials and military, watched as the France flag descended and the American flag ascended succinctly down the pole, meeting halfway to acknowledge exchange of powers. President Thomas Jefferson instructed William Claiborne, Mississippi's current territorial governor at the time and General Wilkinson, commander of the United States Western Army to receive Louisiana from France, who just received it from Spain within the same year. The transaction happened in a time frame of less than 20 days. With the documents signed making the Louisiana Purchase official, Governor Claiborne made a speech to the inhabitants that promised their way of life would not be disturbed. The United States received the \"keys\" to the city and thus the elected William C.C. Claiborne began to act as governor of the territory of Louisiana.","            The Portrait of Governor Claiborne was painted in 1840, 23 years after his death. It is probable that E.B. Savary chose to paint the Governor at a time where New Orleans had a growing population. According to U.S. Bureau of the Census for Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places, New Orleans was the third largest city in 1840 with a population of 102,193 persons. Aside from the rise of popularization of New Orleans, many Louisianans favored Claiborne due to his passiveness in government. Many considered Claiborne qualified for governor because he had served as assistant to a Congress clerk, opened a law firm, appointed as a Tennessee Supreme Court Judge, and selected by President Thomas Jefferson to preside as Mississippi territorial governor. From the very beginning Claiborne sought to appease the people of New Orleans. He adopted their style, delayed the necessary revisions to the laws, and appointed locals to the political office.  This led to a number of critics including that of Andrew Jackson, major General of U.S. forces. In his opinion, he thought of Claiborne as \"much better qualified for great pomp and show, and courting popularity-quiet life- in civil walks- than military achievements amidst peril danger\". Vincent Nolte, a local German-born merchant described Claiborne as \"a weak, intriguing, and gutless man who had not the energy necessary to give a great impulse to the population of Louisiana and cared only for his popularity and preeminence\". Claiborne resented Jackson upon his arrival into New Orleans because now he would be forced to take orders from a man whom had absolute authority and Claiborne considered Jackson to be inferior. ","            According to the painting, one would assume that Governor Claiborne symbolized a man with great military strength, but on the contrary he was not known for fighting battles. Perhaps the military uniform shown speaks of Claiborne's desired image to be taken seriously, but his smirk in the portrait speaks volumes of how the governor was gullible. Although Governor Claiborne aided the U.S. military with war supplies during the Battle of New Orleans, he did not directly win its victory. Despite his shortcomings on the battlefield, Claiborne is remembered for his numerous contributions in advancing Louisiana such as building new roads, establishing a mail service, and developing a public educational system. After serving as Governor of Louisiana he was elected into the U.S. Senate, but died before ever taking office. Claiborne, as a result of his serene administration is prescribed honor and place in the history of New Orleans, thus he is remembered by this grand portrait to credit his contribution."],"display_date":"January 20, 1840 - August 20, 1840","search_date":"1840-05-05","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":29,"tag":"New Orleans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":47,"tag":"Governor Claiborne"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":56,"tag":"Battle of New Orleans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4467,"title":"Tenement Homework and the Exploitation of Child Labor","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The image of a mother, father, and their three young children huddled around a small table in a dimly lit, overcrowded tenement tediously sewing garments into the early hours of the morning is not unique to the photographs captured by Lewis Hine. Hine's work often demonstrated the dignity of the worker, but reflected the purposes of those who hired him. Hines was surrounded by and influenced by the vibrant reform movement and worked closely with Felix Adler, head of the National Child Labor Committee for which his photo entitled 'Home Work' was taken. It was believed by these Progressives that poverty might be eliminated by publicizing the plight of the poor. The ills of tenement life, the exploitation of child labor, and the practice of homework as evident in the photo by Hine became three issues Progressives toiled to change in urban environments like the Lower East Side of New York.","In most tenements, there was only one room that had access to outside air, leaving the interior rooms dark and unventilated. Overcrowding, neglect on the part of the owners, and violation of the simplest rules of sanitation by the tenants, together with the design of the building, created serious hygienic problems. These living quarters usually had no more than two rooms. One room typically served as a kitchen and living space, and the other as a bedroom. Families often set up one of these rooms as a sweatshop as well and together the family would spend long hours rolling cigars, making artificial flowers, or most commonly sewing clothes.","The industry of producing ready-made clothing increased greatly at the turn of the twentieth century and coincided nicely with the influx of immigrant laborers. This particular industry was organized as a contract system where cloth was purchased by the contractor from the textile manufacturer. The fabric was then cut and finished by hired garment workers who completed the work in their apartments. The practice of home work became a serious issue because it often meant the use of child labor, exploitation of workers outside of the factory setting, and the development of goods under unsanitary conditions. In response to public concern about industrial homework, some states, including New York, tried to regulate tenement homework. These regulations aimed to protect the consumers from health problems associated with purchasing goods produced under unsanitary conditions. This was done by prohibiting the manufacture of certain articles in dwelling places and that these tenements meet certain sanitary and health provisions. It would still take several years and further efforts by Progressives to have regulations of homework put in place to benefit the lives and rights of the families performing the housework.","Despite these initial regulations, tenement manufacture was still being done under unhealthy conditions for low wages, long hours, and through the continued exploitation of child labor. Although several compulsory education and child labor laws were passed in New York at the end of the nineteenth century, these laws were difficult to enforce. The Compulsory Education Law of 1874 had tried to require all children between eight and fourteen to attend school for fourteen weeks a year, but one survey of 371 home workers from 110 families found that nearly half of those workers were under the age of sixteen. Further attempts to strengthen the regulations on home work came in 1913 with licensing provisions which meant that employers were required to obtain special permits before they could give out material to employees for tenement manufacture. The Child Labor Law was also extended to cover this type of manufacturing. These stronger policies did not alleviate the problems with home labor, however; an investigation conducted ten years later found that practically nothing had changed. It was not until the 1930s when laws were passed at the federal and state level to prohibit homework."],"display_date":1910,"search_date":"1910-07-02","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":65,"tag":"Child Labor"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4471,"title":"Growing Pains in New York&#39;s Lower East Side","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-01-01","end_date":"12/31/01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An early 1900s postcard photograph from New York's Souvenir Post Card Company captures the Lower East Side's crowded and chaotic environment. As American Jewish historian Hasia Diner notes, \"at the right moment in time, under the right conditions, ordinary places become transformed into spaces throbbing with meaning.\"  Such was the case with New York's iconic Lower East Side.  The photo shows Hester Street, a main avenue through the Lower East Side, clearly depicting the neighborhood's massive population.  The scene is inundated with adults selling goods and children playing in the street, framed by dozens of towering tenement houses crowded closely together.  Due to the living conditions within the tenements, most activities like business and recreation took place in the street.","As author Deborah Hopkinson details, in the mid 1800s, tenement buildings were hurriedly and inexpensively built in the Lower East Side to quickly accommodate hoards of new immigrants.  Hearing stories about new opportunities available in a predominantly Jewish atmosphere, multitudes of European Jews flocked to New York, America's hub of immigration, in search of a new life.  By the late 1800s, the Lower East Side quickly earned a reputation as America's ultimate Jewish neighborhood, filled with Jewish immigrants.  By 1910, more Jews lived in New York City than any other city in history.  But, with such a rapid influx of people, the Lower East Side neighborhood was forced to deal with a serious urban housing problem: overcrowding.","Tenement buildings served as the main source of housing, providing very modest living spaces for newly arrived immigrants.  But, over time, most Lower East Side tenements fell into disrepair as many landlords lacked interest in maintenance or improvements.  Therefore, by the 1880s, the already overcrowded tenements became unsafe and unhealthy havens of filth, often lacking necessary amenities.  The worsening living conditions of the Lower East Side drove some individuals to action, including Jewish immigrant and journalist Jacob Riis.  Noting that \"nowhere in the world are so many people crowded together on a square mile as [the Lower  East Side],\" Riis drew attention to the urban overcrowding problem through photographs.","With the invention of flash photography in the 1880s, Riis and other individuals were able to clearly depict Lower East Side housing problems by capturing indoor images of the actual dark, decrepit, overpopulated living spaces inside the tenements.  Riis' revealing photos later appeared in his famous 1890 book, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, influencing later New York City housing reforms like the Tenement House Law of 1901 and the creation of the Tenement House Commission.

Riis in his groundbreaking 1890 work, <em>How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York,</em> describe a desolate corner of the urban decay that characterized New York's Lower East Side in the late 1800s. Riis, a Danish immigrant who came to New York in 1870, used cutting edge flash photography to illustrate the depraved conditions of the city and quickly gained notoriety as one of the leading \"muckrakers;\" a name referring to group of reformers who used journalism to lead the way in exposing social problems and the call for reform.","One of the chapters in the book focuses on the conditions of Mulberry Bend just north of the Five Points, which Riis illustrates with a photograph showing the chaotic look of the street on a typical day. Riis describes in detail how street crime and gangs prevailed in \"the Bend\" over the local law enforcement and how the death rate was extremely high within the area, which was fifty percent higher than the rest of the city. Especially tragic was the death rate for children under five, which was significantly higher than all other areas. Central to the problem facing Riis at this time was a way to solve the issues of urban decay and the slums in a way which would go beyond the limitations of philanthropy but without advocating a socialist doctrine, which would be condemned by those in power. Beginning in 1888 and continuing into the 1890s Riis began giving lectures that incorporated photographs of the conditions of \"the Bend\" to philanthropic groups and the general public, which supplemented his journalistic newspaper writing to help spread awareness about the slum problem.","In 1888 the Tenement House Committee of New York had drawn up plans for Mulberry Park in the block between Bayard, Park, Baxter, and Mulberry streets, which made up the area known as \"the Bend.\" It would take six more years until the property was bought for the park. The major reason for the slow action by the committee stems from the hesitancy of city officials to mettle in the affairs of the landlords of tenements in the most need of change. It was the release of Riis's book and the public outcry that accompanied it that finally helped to push the city toward purchasing the land and building the park. On December 21, 1893 Riis offered a solution to the unemployment of the city in the New York <em>Evening Sun </em>in which he called for the use of public funds to hire workers to demolish the depraved buildings that made up \"the Bend.\" Even after the land was purchased and the buildings were demolished in 1895 the area remained barren until 1897 when the park opened. It was only due to increased pressure from Riis and other reformers that the park within the urban slum could be finally realized. Possibly the greatest irony involved in the creation of the park came at its dedication on June 15, 1897; a ceremony in which Riis was not invited to attend."],"display_date":"1888 - 1897","search_date":"1892-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4566,"title":"Ex-Confederates Move Way Down South","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For some Confederates at the end of the war, defeat was too much to bear. By the 1870, the Census Bureau estimated that there was a net loss of more than 300,000 migrants in nine former Confederate states. The ones that left the United States altogether and went by way of Brazil and Mexico were known as \"confederados\" and built their homes in Santarem in the Amazon basin and Santa Barbara D'Oeste in the state of Sao Paulo. The New York Times had an 1866 featured article entitled \"Rebel Migration to Mexico\" on the front page that details attacks on a Mexican steamer that was believed to have been manned by United States citizens. The Times addressed the rebels more harshly as insurgents when it described the correspondence between a man Romero and William Seward. The Times implies the armed insurgency was meant to be a wedge between the United States and French interests in Mexico.","    George Harmon's research suggests there was a more organized effort in the Brazil emigration than the Mexican one. One example of an ÉmigrÉ was General Sterling Price who chose the Cordova Valley for its climate and fertile soil. Harmon noted that the Cordova Valley was one of the better choices in Brazil \"since agriculture was to be the main pursuit and occupation of the southern emigrant, a more ideal location for planting a permanent colony could hardly have been found in all Mexico.\"","    Not surprisingly, the people that had the financing for this undertaking came from Southern society and slaveholding families. They sought out a place where \"good fellowship could be enjoyed by all; and where their lost fortunes could more quickly and easily be forgotten or retrieved.\"","    The legacy exists today in Santa Barbara where descendants hold a \"Festa Confederada\" picnic on the second Sunday in April where there are biscuits and fried chicken, as well as renditions of \"Dixie\" sung in Brazilian-Portuguese accents.

George Harmon claims at the end of his essay that due to the extreme hostility of Mexicans toward foreigners, a vast majority had moved back to the United States, but a considerable number moved on to Yucatan, Venezuela and Jamaica never to return."],"display_date":1866,"search_date":"1866-07-02","locations":[{"id":13344,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"YOUNG TERRITORY, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":131,"tag":"The Confederate States of America"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":5107,"title":"The Interurban Railroad of California","course_id":49,"status":"P","start_date":"10/18/01","end_date":"10/18/01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Southern Pacific Railroad Company Traffic Department announced on October 16, 1901, that Paul Shoup would be replacing Thomas A. Graham as division freight and passenger agent with jurisdictions south of San Francisco, Oakland, and north of Santa Barbara, with his headquarters in San Jose. J.C Stubbs, Traffic Director; William Sproule, freight traffic manager and E.O McCormick, passenger traffic manager, approved the appointment. The appointment took effect on October 18, 1901.","Paul Shoup rose to a prominent position in the Southern Pacific Railroad Company through his management of the railroad’s electric interurban lines. As the roads were unpaved and traveling was predominantly by horseback or wagon, the electric interurban made traveling comfortable, faster, and cheaper for passengers. The electric interurban lines in California and other cities in the United States connected cities together by making more stops at urban centers than the larger railroad lines that traveled further and hauled heavy cargo. The Southern Pacific Railroad interurban lines were predominantly located in the Los Angeles area linking the City of Angels to Long Beach and Orange County. The Interurban Electric Railway (IER) connected Berkeley, Oakland, and San Leandro, while the Peninsular Railway connected San Jose and Palo Alto.","However, the success of the interurban railroad led to its demise. As the economy improved due to the construction of the interurban railroad, people in the Bay Area were able to afford automobiles and the interurban railroad usage declined.  Many of the companies responsible for its success ended up filing for bankruptcy."],"display_date":"October 18, 1901","search_date":"1901-10-18","locations":[{"id":52284,"lat":37.4562619895,"lng":-122.096750388,"zoom":9,"place":"Santa Clara, California"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":790,"tag":"Paul Shoup"},{"id":666,"tag":"Railroad"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":49,"school_id":40}},{"id":6034,"title":"Progress of the Dept. of Parks and Recreation in Detroit, MI","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Twelve years after the Detroit Parks and Recreation Department entered into service, they proudly announced that they had become the “largest and most active [Department] in our City Government.” Originally created to prevent overlaps in event planning, the department expanded along with the booming city of Detroit. The total acreage of Detroit parks from 1940-52 jumped from 4163 to 5736 acres, including a total of 170 new parks. The new ice rink, hoped administrators, would benefit future players of the Detroit Red Wings, while the boating dock of the Memorial Park Marina would help the city attract new capital. Dramatic urban renewal projects that included the construction of several new depressed highways produced large amounts of excess dirt, some of which the city used to build new toboggan chutes on top of Water Canyon Park. The Hawthorne Recreation Center was built on the site of an abandoned warehouse, creating a playground where “a factory had been converted into a production of citizens.”","These projects reflected the Parks and Recreation Department's efforts to work on a very local level to improve the quality of life for its citizens. While urban renewal projects as a whole tend to focus on the larger, top-down picture of the \"greater good,\" many of the new parks projects of the era suggest a real engagement with local needs and landscapes. The relocation and reuse of excess dirt from the construction highways, for instance, is a practical and locally-based solution to two separate problems. Additionally, the types of parks produced, including the boating dock expansion project, capitalized on the city's natural resources of riverfront property. Extending Detroit’s hockey season also foresaw the setbacks of the seasonal changes, and counteracted the limitations of weather to produce a longer season. These ideas blended nature into artificial environments, and produced recreational activities which nature and human interaction can exist interdependantly."],"display_date":"1940 - 1952","search_date":"1946-07-02","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":1947,"tag":"City parks"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1971,"tag":"urban planning"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
