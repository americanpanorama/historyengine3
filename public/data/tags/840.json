Elias Colbert an editor for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> newspaper recounts the progress the fire made while peering through his telescope from the rooftop of the TribuneBuilding.","Colbert attempts to gather statistical facts on the losses generated by the great conflagration in his article titled, <em>The Losses by the Fire</em>. He concludes that the factual calculations of the total damage would be a rough estimate.","An estimation of 500 buildings including frame structures lost from the fiery blaze and displaced 2, 250 residents on the West Division of the city. Approximately 3,650 buildings were destroyed in the South Division, which included 1600 stores, 28 hotels, and 60 manufacturing establishments. About 21,800 residents became homeless on the upper stories. In the North Division area the burning blaze left 500 establishments standing out of 13,800, leaving 13,300 in ruins making 74, 450 people homeless. Over 600 stores and 100 factories burned along with a portion of the southern part of Lincoln Park. Before the blaze came to a halt, it destroyed 17,450 buildings within a 3.5 square mile. The total damage cost Chicago $200 million. About one-third of the city was ruin and nearly 98,500 people were homeless [1].","The flames moved north and east, leaping over the fire engines and progressing beyond them enclosing their entire apparatus as the flames move east and west. From the west side of Jefferson Street, as far as the eye could reach, in an easterly direction--and the river bound that space--a perfect sea of leaping flames covered the ground.","As far as north of North Avenue, to the river and the lake, the entire North side was a seething infernal. By daylight, the fierce and raging fire was one massive sheet of flame creating a perfect ocean blaze of the east that stretched 7 miles long.","On October 10, the rainfall, the lake, and undeveloped lots on the North side subdued the destructive blaze. Telegraph posts are transfigured into burned and branchless trees, and in this blue land of supreme fancy, the prosaic and the commonplace have disappeared forever. At another point one can faintly distinguish twisted and distorted iron beams, half covering and half covered by massive blocks of stone."," ","[1]Elias Colbert, \"Losses by the Fire,\" <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, October 8, 1871."],"display_date":"October 8, 1871 - October 10, 1871","search_date":"1871-10-09","locations":[{"id":2540,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":839,"tag":"destruction"},{"id":836,"tag":"fire"},{"id":827,"tag":"Chicago"},{"id":840,"tag":"Illinois"},{"id":841,"tag":"1871"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":6352,"title":"<strong>Ada James sure showed them!</strong> The ratification the 19th amendment in Wisconsin.","course_id":141,"status":"P","start_date":"11/1/19","end_date":"11/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ada James was a key figure in the women's suffrage movement in Wisconsin.  She and her family played an instrumental part in Wisconsin's ratification of the 19th amendment.  In one of Ada's diary entry's she stated, \"it is unjust to hold mothers responsible for the morals of their children while denying them a voice on municipal conditions making up their environment.\"  Tis quote shows Ada's desire for change and a logical reasoning for a long overdue ratification of the 19th amendment.  It also demonstrates her values which stem from her mother a longtime Wisconsin suffragist and her father a strong supporter of the movement.","Ada's father was in fact the reason Wisconsin narrowly beat their rivals to the south Illinois, in the honor of being the first to ratify the 19th amendment.  David James, Ada's father personally raced to Washington to deliver the ratification papers.  As the article in the <em>Milwaukee Journal </em>from November 2, 1919 so strikingly states, Ada James a descendant of a suffrage family \"showed\" Illinois women that Wisconsin was the first to ratify the 19th amendment.  Noted for her outspoken nature, a key to her success in the ratification, Ada publically claimed Wisconsin's honor and denounced Illinois' false claim as the first to ratify the 19th amendment.","There is a lot of debate over this fact, partly to do with the happening that Illinois was also sending a messenger to Washington to ratify at the same time.  However, there was a problem with the wording of the Illinois bill and they were turned away.  Mr. James entered the state department with the Wisconsin ratification papers in hand as the Illinois messenger was leaving.","Ada \"showed\" them, Illinois, in her public speech held at a victory ceremony held at the Milwaukee Athletic Club.  The applause roared as Ada dispersed any doubt in Wisconsin's rightful title of the first state to ratify the suffrage amendment.  Ada sought equality for women, her impact on the Wisconsin Women's Suffrage Organizations in which she was a leading member of, and her dedication and challenge of leadership changed the course of Wisconsin's women's suffrage movement forever."," "," "," "],"display_date":"November 1, 1919","search_date":"1919-11-01","locations":[{"id":16292,"lat":43.0070321924,"lng":-87.9667286742,"zoom":10,"place":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}],"tags":[{"id":2206,"tag":"Wisconsin"},{"id":1710,"tag":"Voting Rights"},{"id":2673,"tag":"Ada James"},{"id":2674,"tag":"19th amendment"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2675,"tag":"Ratify"},{"id":1323,"tag":"rivalry"},{"id":840,"tag":"Illinois"},{"id":2712,"tag":"Milwaukee Athletic Club"},{"id":2713,"tag":"Milwaukee Journal"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":141,"school_id":68}}]}
