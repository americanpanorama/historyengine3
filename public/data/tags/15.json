receiving a petition by Baton Rouge citizens, the local government established a colored church and hired a black Methodist preacher, George Menard, to lead the church.  Besides encouraging this and other black churches, townsmen even permitted blacks to attend white churches.  Although the Black Code in Baton Rouge seemed to impress a harsh code of conduct, the authorities rarely enforced these statutes.  Instead, there was more trust in this community, leading to a more peaceful region.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One example of the different attitude Baton Rouge and Louisiana held toward slavery is found in newspapers.  Consistently, the New Orleans Times-Picayune presented favorable articles about blacks and slaves.  For instance, in covering the funeral of a former Savannah mayor, it reported more on the heartwarming response of slaves to his death than on the white response, or even the funeral itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historians recognize that this unique system was due to a variety of factors.  The multiracial Creole society and the strong Catholic influences in Louisiana explain part of it.  However, Baton Rouge also had a different sort of community.  Because it was not a plantation area, slaves were more likely to belong in small numbers to individual families than to reside in large numbers.  Maybe due to this, unlike many Southern areas, the white leaders of Baton Rouge did not fear the spread of antislavery sentiments through black churches, perhaps considering their own influence to be stronger."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":5503,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":36,"title":"Mississippi Passes a State Civil Rights Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-02-27","end_date":"1873-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the time of Reconstruction, strong Republican parties grew as a result of heavy reliance of blacks as their constituency. Generating the overwhelming majority of the party's votes, blacks became the majority of the electorate in Southern states, such as South Carolina, Louisiana, and Mississippi. As the black support increased, it was clear that policies and enactments had to be geared towards the large freedmen population. To maintain control and influence, Republicans mobilized black voters by emphasizing their party's commitment and promise for black rights and interests.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Mississippi, where the freedmen constituted a majority of almost six to five in the state's electorate, the newly enfranchised blacks would open the doors for Republican rule. In 1868, the Republicans constructed a new constitution; in 1869, they won the elections to fill the offices created under it; and by 1870, the first Republican administration of Mississippi took office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1873, the Republican Party continued to control Mississippi. In that year, Adelbert Ames, Mississippi's best-known carpetbagger became the second Republican governor of Mississippi. Under his administration, Republican state legislators were able to pass an important Civil Rights Bill that stated all citizens of this State, without distinction of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, are entitled to the equal and impartial enjoyment of any accommodation, advantage, facility, or privilege;and is hereby declared to have always been, is now, and shall forever remain a right, inherent in every citizen or person, and which right shall not be denied, abridged or infringed;' Subsequently, any person that went against this bill was to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. As a result of enactments such as this, black voters responded exactly as Republican leaders hoped. Unsurprisingly, colored turnout for Republican candidates increased dramatically in Mississippi. In a negative regard, the deliberate painting of the Republican Party as the party of the blacks also encouraged Democrats throughout the South to run as the party of white supremacy."],"display_date":"February 27, 1873","search_date":"1873-02-27","locations":[{"id":7060,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":38,"title":"Alabama Legislature Introduces a Civil Rights Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-02-20","end_date":"1873-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As acquiring civil rights became a political mark indicating the party's commitment to its black supporters, the passage of these measures demonstrated the shift of priority and power that was occurring within the Republican Party. Indeed, the black constituency in the South greatly influenced and led legislation. Needing to consolidate the crucial black vote, Republican legislators pressed for additional civil rights guarantees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On February 20, 1873, The Weekly Clarion reported that a civil rights bill was proposed in the Alabama Legislature that decided to give to all races and colors equal civil rights in the schools, theaters, hotels, railroads, churches, cemeteries, etc.; and to punish violations by fine of from 500 5000, and imprisonment not exceeding five years;' This was an important effort by the Alabama Republican Party to gain political control as well as reassure and strengthen the necessary black constituency within the state. This bill, however, would pass in the Senate and would fail narrowly in the House. In fact, the bill failed in the House mainly because the opposition of the Democratic-Conservatives prevented the introduction of amendments that would have moderated the terms of the bill. Accordingly, Republicans in white districts opposed the seemingly extreme form of the bill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there remained the hope that the Republican Party in Alabama would stay strong, the influence of the Democratic-Conservatives would continue to grow stronger. In the summer of 1873, John Forsyth led a campaign to prove to the Democratic-Conservative leadership that Alabama could be rescued from the Republican Party if attempting to appeal to black voters and white Republicans was abandoned. Instead, those of the Democratic Party called to vigorously petition white voters of southern Alabama. By 1874, the Democrats would indeed gain dominance. Thus, Alabama became the first state to defeat the Republicans with the politics of the color line."],"display_date":"February 20, 1873","search_date":"1873-02-20","locations":[{"id":302,"lat":32.2201632469,"lng":-86.2079113368,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":41,"title":"Supreme Court Overrules Decision in United States vs. A.

These laws were a means of assessing property and establishing voter eligibility. Simply put, these laws made it the responsibility of a Delaware resident to see that his name was on the assessment lists for the county tax and then to see that he paid his taxes. Only if the tax was paid could he qualify to vote. However, if a man was delinquent in paying his tax, then this resulted in the removal of his name from the tax list for one year by the levy of the court. To hinder blacks from voting, legislators employed these tactics so that their taxes could not be paid, therefore disqualifying them their vote. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To disqualify voters, some assessors acted neglectful, conveniently forgetting to enter a name or entering it in the wrong assessment record. Subsequently, when a black property owner went to pay his tax, it was refused on the grounds that the property owner had not been properly assessed. The tax collector then recorded him as delinquent and struck him from voter registration lists. Furthermore, names were often misspelled or recorded wrong. As a result, black property owners were omitted from tax lists. In these instances, the tax collector refused to accept the assessment, believing the receipt to be counterfeit. Thus, most of the black population and even some white Republicans could not vote. As the Democrats retained control of the election machinery and acts such as these were passed, it became very difficult for African-Americans to qualify to vote. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the specific case of United States vs. A, Given, the U.S. Circuit Court  convicted a collector of county taxes last October for the violation of the second section of the enforcement act. Given had disqualified colored voters by throwing their names off the assessment lists as could be done by the Assessment and Collection Laws. Supreme Court Justices Strong and Bradford, however, rendered a decision overruling the motion for arrest of judgment made by the counsel of the defendant on the grounds that the enforcement act of Congress was unconstitutional. This decision, thereby, affirmed the constitutionality of the Assessment and Collection Laws of Delaware."],"display_date":"January 9, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-09","locations":[{"id":1259,"lat":39.5008834932,"lng":-75.568787499,"zoom":9,"place":"NEW CASTLE, Delaware"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":43,"title":"President Ulysses S.

African-Americans began to flex their political muscles despite common obstacles of white dominance. An example of momentary white repression occurred in South Carolina to black politician Robert B. Elliott, who later took a seat in the House. It is likely that South Carolina would have had an African American Senator represent them through Elliott. However, in the late 1872 election, white carpetbagger, John J. Patterson, bought the U.S. Senate seat through bribery, disgracing, not only Elliott, but also the colored population. Elliott later commented on the peculiar circumstances in the Atlanta Constitution saying the colored men, as you know, are in large majority in the Legislature, and then for them to deliberately sell out by wholesale is a blow;at our integrity, our honestly, our manhood.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, instances like Elliott's did not stop African-Americans from increasingly occupying offices on all levels of government. By 1873, black representation in the newly elected 43rd Congress had grown from five representatives to seven. They included, Richard H. Cain, Robert B. Elliott, Joseph H. Rainey, and Alonzo J. Ransier of South Carolina, Josiah Walls of Florida, James T. Rapier of Alabama, and John R. Lynch of Mississippi.

Tennessee, Georgia, and Virginia had turned to Democratic control, while in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas, Republican governors confronted hostile or divided legislatures. The salience of black politicians within the party and the awareness of the need to satisfy and consolidate the significant Republican black constituency were both growing. As the Radical Republican evolved into the party predominately supporting African-Americans, the Democrats were encouraged to run as the party of white supremacy.

Furthermore, as Kellogg faced strong opposition right from the beginning of his term, the darker side of the white-line politics came to the forefront.  This emerging political conflict would only open the doors for the violence and lawlessness among the white and black communities to ensue, leading to brutal happenings like the Colfax Massacre.

Essentially, most of the state and local administration was under election, as the positions of Governor, delegates of the Legislature as well as county officers, except clerks, were under contestation. Furthermore, the following winter of 1873 brought the necessity to choose a State Senator by the newly elected Legislature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As The Baltimore Sun revealed, both political parties were very much divided on railroad, local, as well as personal issues.

However, they also feared that the Seminoles would create unrest in Florida and that their slaves would join the tribe in rebelling and inspiring insurrections in the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an editorial published in the Georgia Macon, a writer recommended that Florida offer monetary rewards for volunteers to kill and capture Seminole Indians, saying, unless they be still hunted, I despair of ever seeing them removed.' The incident made evident that even though the Seminole population in the State consisted of less than 500 at that point in time, the Florida state government as well as the United States government remained suspicious about their activities and strength, could not imagine peacefully co-existing with the tribe, and had no doubts as to their own right to strip the native population of any possible land claims."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":1284,"lat":29.7296251981,"lng":-82.4202056031,"zoom":9,"place":"ALACHUA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":87,"title":"Rumors of Slave Insurrections in New Orleans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-06-13","end_date":"1853-06-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rumors of an intended slave insurrection alarmed whites living in New Orleans as well as throughout the South as the news of the supposed insurrection travel through newspapers published around the country.

The Jacksonian idea of equal ability of all' and the Democratic Party's characterization of the common man' was pervasive, while the wealthy landowners and aristocrats still in existence became entrenched in the opposition Whig party.  In January of 1845, a new Constitutional Convention for Louisiana met in New Orleans; progress was slow while citizens expressed their thoughts and hopes for the new Constitution: If tardiness of progress be a characteristic of great bodies, it is an attribute of greatness to which the Convention may justly lay claim.  Thus far their motion has been particularly slow , a snail-pace gait; but it is to be hoped that when rules for the government of their proceedings are adopted, and when, having erected their scaffolding, they set about in good sooth, to build up the new Constitution, the work will proceed more rapidly, and when executed be worthy of the architects who undertook the enterprise, and of the State, the monument of whose wisdom and the temple of whose liberty it is at once designed to be.'","This new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 embodied the Jacksonian ideals and feel.  It sharply restricted the power of the state to lend money and forbade the state from becoming a stockholder; it also prohibited lotteries, dueling, legislative divorces, the official granting of monopolies, and restricted the state's power to issue charters.  The new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 eliminated property holding requirements for holding public office, and established total population (including free whites, voteless free blacks and slaves) for the use of apportionment in the state senate, while the state house of representatives was still apportioned by voter population.  The new constitution also made strides in the state sector of education by creating the office of superintendent of public education and by pushing the legislature to establish public schools.  In the sector of justice, the courts were improved significantly and for the first time, felons under sentences of death or life in prison could appeal to the state Supreme Court."],"display_date":"January 14, 1845","search_date":"1845-01-14","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":102,"title":"Influential Use of the Phrase &#147;Manifest Destiny&#39;\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-27","end_date":"1845-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The phrase manifest destiny originated in 1844 with a journalist in New York named John O'Sullivan in his magazine called the <em>Democratic Review</em>, in reference to the annexation of Texas.  Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":104,"title":"Florida Admitted as the 27th State\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-03-03","end_date":"1845-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The presidential approval of Florida's entering the Union as a (slave) state occurred on the last day of Tyler's administration.

His later distinguished military career included the Tennessee militia, the War of 1812, and exploits dealing with and removing the Creeks, Seminoles, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws in the South, which gave him his heroic public image and his renown as an Indian fighter.  The Jacksonian Era of American politics (generally between the War of 1812 and the Civil War) was named for him.  President Jackson sympathized with Southern feelings yet denounced nullification as treason' during the nullification crisis because of his support of federalism and keeping the Union, opposed the National Bank, and, with his Maysville Road Bill veto, added federal support to road construction while at the same time conceding to states' rights and not alienating those who supported internal improvements.&lt;br /&gt;An Ohio statesman attributed President Jackson's popularity to his focus on the common man and characteristics of his personality: There is one remarkable trait about the character of General Jackson that endears him to the people.

Its editor, Cassius Marcellus Clay, was an outspoken abolitionist from the South (a Whig from Kentucky).  His arguments against slavery usually were primarily economic in nature, thus appealing to the self-interests of farmers and small slaveholders that, at the time, were feeling the effects of severe economic depression in the tobacco market.  Clay listed several reasons why slavery was inefficient: it impoverishes soil', slaves weren't as skillful, energetic, or full of self interest' as whites, slaves supposedly produced less and consumed more than freemen, and slavery caused the poor to despise labor by degrading' it, while at the same time turning slaveholders into lazy, idle people.  He also argued that slavery caused national poverty, kept economic development from occurring at the pace that it could have by restricting education, diverting funds into slaves, and discouraging development of skills.&lt;br /&gt;Clay was correct to fear pro-slavery forces in Lexington; he fortified the office of the True American with cannons, rifles, lances, and a keg of gunpowder, and carried weapons with him wherever he went.  The Christian patriot' John G. Fee, who also harbored antislavery sentiments, experienced the threat of violence against Clay in Kentucky himself: About this time, at my suggestion, a petition was sent to Cassius M. Clay, requesting him to come to Lewis County, July 4th, 1846, and make to us an address on the subject of slavery and emancipation. The call was signed by twenty-seven citizens, to be sent to Mr. Clay.  Mr. Clay accepted the invitation, commended highly the courage of the men who had made the call, but sent back the sad intelligence that he must defer the purposed address until his return from the war with Mexico;This stirred the slave power, especially in Mason County, the adjoining county. ","An article appeared in the <em>Maysville Eagle</em>, which in some respects misrepresented the statement of the former, by saying: This is as rank Abolitionism as was ever uttered by Birney or Tappan. No slaveholder is hereafter to receive the votes of these simon-pure liberty men; and they who dare to apologize for the institutions of our country are thus denounced and proscribed, and this is heralded forth as the sentiments of Lewis County.';Mr. Clay, having declined then to come, and the slave power raging, some ten men of the twenty-seven who had signed the call inviting Mr. Clay to come, took back their names; and upon myself, Mr. Clay's correspondent, were gathered the severest anathemas, and threats of violence and of the utter destruction of my house;My friends expected the threatened violence, and a man whom we knew as a friend and one who had opportunity to know the movements of our enemies came three times during the day and entreated that I leave my home or I would certainly be killed. At night we went to bed as usual;Many, with purposes of violence, did gather at the place of rendezvous, but dispersed before the frowning elements [inclement weather]. Soon after this the prime mover was killed by a tenant;Another man who shot at me whilst I was sitting in my house, was soon afterward drowned in the Ohio river.'

The amendment was based on a plan devised by Francis D. Winston of Bertie County and largely mirrored a provision adopted in Louisiana the previous year. The amendment would change election laws so that a new state election board would take over many of the powers previously resting with the sheriffs. The state election board would call county election board, which would then be responsible for calling all elections and appointing election officials in their county. The standardization of the system was meant to guarantee that black citizens were not voting illegally. The Atlanta Constitution ran an article explaining the new provisions on February 4 and they assured readers that: registration will be surrounded by such safeguards as will prevent the importation of negro voters by requiring perfect identification of the voter'. &lt;br /&gt;The Democrats also submitted on the same day an amendment to the state constitution that would limit suffrage in the state. According to the amendment, citizens were required to pass rigorous tests in order to be granted the right to vote. According to the Richmond Dispatch, Article 4 stated the following: Every person presenting himself for registration shall be able to read and write any section of the constitution in the English language and in addition thereto shall have paid on or before the first day of February of the year in which he proposes to vote his poll tax, as prescribed by law, for the previous year'. However, the next section of the article goes on to make huge exemptions from this clause designed to ensure that whites who did not meet these criteria could still vote. Anyone who had been registered to vote in 1867 and any of their descendants were still allowed to vote. &lt;br /&gt;The Atlanta Constitution conjectured that 30,000 black North Carolinians would be affected by this amendment while not one white person would be denied the right to vote. It disenfranchises the ignorant negro vote; It does not disenfranchise any white voters. It is the belief that it will be an incentive to education'. The amendment would be voted upon in August of the same year by all registered voters, white and black, in the state, making its adoption perfectly fair and complete'.

However, as of Friday March 21, at least seven victims had been identified and by Saturday, it was believed that at least twelve were dead. &lt;br /&gt;According to the Birmingham newspaper, Little River County was known for its racial turmoil. The negro population is large and has for a long time proved very troublesome to the whites.

In this particular incident, whites claim that they had discovered a very carefully laid plan among blacks in the area to incite a race war and that individual whites had been identified at potential targets. They believed that as many as twenty-three men were involved in the plot. In response, whites set out to wipe out' all twenty-three of the supposed conspirators. The Birmingham paper reported chaos in the region: white men are collecting in mobs, heavily armed and determined; negroes are fleeing for their lives, and the community is in uproar'. Anyone suspected of involvement that was found was quickly hung from the closest branch. When black citizens learned of the first several deaths, they became panicked and fled the area. Several among the dead reached the Texas state line before being caught by mobs and killed.

At the beginning of 1899, State health official, W.T. Blunt, ordered drastic measures- house-to-house vaccination, fumigation and burning of all personal effects suspected of contamination- to be taken to control the smallpox epidemic. However, by March 16, conditions had grown worse rather than better, so Blunt was ordered to the region to spearhead the effort. However, a group of Laredo residents, largely Mexican American, refused to comply with Blunt's instructions, leading Blunt to call in the Texas Rangers to assist in the implementation of his orders. On March 19, the Rangers arrived, and commenced using forceful tactics against those suspected of having the disease. The citizens took to the streets in protest and began hurling rocks at the Rangers, prompting them to shoot into the crowd, wounding at least one man. The following day, a report was made to the local sheriff that a large order of buckshot had been made in that area of the city. The investigation led Sheriff Ortiz to the home of Agapito Herrera where, after brief negotiations, a gun battle ensued between the police and a group of armed men inside Herrera's home. Herrera was fatally shot and several others on both sides were wounded. After evacuating their injured officer, the rangers returned to find an armed crowd surrounding Herrera's body and another shootout followed. Throughout the night, gunfire could be heard throughout the surrounding neighborhoods. Finally, on the morning of March 21, backups from the US Cavalry arrived and restored peace. In the following days, work continued to try to control the smallpox epidemic and twenty-one people suspected of involvement in the riot were arrested. &lt;br /&gt;          Smallpox and other diseases were still rampant at the end of the 19th century. A Richmond Dispatch article from January of 1899 reports that smallpox had broken out in Mississippi, Alabama and, likely, in Tennessee and Georgia, as well. These diseases often affected minority groups disproportionately because their substandard economic situation and inferior living conditions made them more susceptible to illness. Disease was the leading killer in the Spanish-American War, killing nearly 5,000 US soldiers. In fact, the majority of casualties were suffered after the fighting had ceased.&lt;br /&gt;          Efforts were being made by scientists to cure these diseases and by officials to help citizens do whatever they could to avoid them. An anatomy exam from the University of Virginia in May of 1899 asked students to describe in detail such parts of the body as the skull, certain bones, ligaments, joints, several different muscle groups, the kidney, the pancreas, the cerebrum, the heart, and several different nerves. This illustrates that universities were working hard to educate students about the intricate workings of the human body. Extensive work was done by doctors and scientists during the Spanish-&lt;br /&gt;American war to discover how diseases spread. Walter Reed, an American Army surgeon was able to prove that yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. He would go on in 1900 to create a vaccine for yellow fever. And, like in Texas, when officials in North Carolina discovered a method they thought could fight disease, they used the law to enforce cooperation with their plan. On May 3 they issued an ordinance making vaccination against smallpox compulsory, threatening to fine those who did not comply. Disease was a powerful killer throughout the nineteenth century and, while steps were being taken to understand the spread of disease and to stop it where they could, officials and scientists still could not prevent outbreaks and citizens still resisted their attempts to impose unwelcome policies upon them."],"display_date":"March 19, 1899 - March 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-20","locations":[{"id":13306,"lat":27.8795150762,"lng":-99.636805503,"zoom":8,"place":"WEBB, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":165,"title":"William Henson sentenced to death.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-04-27","end_date":"1827-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27th, 1827 a verdict was reached in the William Henson case.  The court convicted this free black for forcibly breaking into a house and stealing items of a small value.'  His punishment was death, to be carried out on May 3rd.  This punishment was certainly extreme for such a petty offense, but the court was using what was called the Bloody Act of 1806.  This act as the Raleigh Register explained it said: any person shall break into any dwelling house, shop, warehouse or other outhouse thereto belonging and feloniously take away any money, goods, or chattels of the value of 20 schillings or upwards;shall suffer death without the benefit of clergy'.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henson's skin color certainly did not help his case, but surprisingly the Raleigh Register actually took to the defense of William Henson.  They did not however, come to the obvious conclusion that this act was utilized mainly because of Henson's pigmentation, but instead took it from the fear that any man (particularly white) might be tried under this obscure yet existing law.  People were advocating that although laws needed to exist to curtail crime, they must be equal to the crime.  The Register put it best when it said: Again and again we repeat, let a penitentiary be established'.  People wanted peace, but not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This occurrence shows two strains that mark the South throughout the nineteenth century.  One, that there was a double set of standards for the free black and the white male (even the poorest of whites).  Henson was the sacrificial lamb towards a political movement towards prison reform, not discrimination.  Second, that the entire justice system of the 1800's would undergo drastic changes during this time period from a place of punishment to a place of reform.  It would bring men like de Tocqueville from France to come to the United States and report on this new prison system in 1831.  Therefore, one can see that in many ways 1827 differed from current times but yet it maintained a battle over security vs. freedom that is still being debated to this very day."],"display_date":"April 27, 1827 - May 3, 1827","search_date":"1827-04-30","locations":[{"id":9840,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":168,"title":"African-Americans Try to Improve the Status of Their Race\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1863, black communities began to hold large meetings to discuss the articulation and communication of new attitudes towards African-Americans.

In addition, at this meeting, African-American men in all places, at all times and under all circumstances' were encouraged to stop using the vulgar phrase, nigger,'' because it had become common practice for military officers to address black soldiers as such (Journal, 186).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that African-Americans did attempt to improve the status of their race, the officers did not always respond favorably to these attempts.

The soldier said that he would not stand such language,' especially considering the how respectable the officer was.  The officer responded by hitting the soldier over the head with his gun, which instantly killed him.  The black soldiers then flew to arms' and wounded or killed over one hundred whites.

The article claimed that a portion of the Federal Army was enlisting black soldiers because it would be a great insult and wrong to the South.  However, this article also focuses on the issue of enlisting African-American soldiers into the Confederate Army, which seems to have been met with even greater resistance among Southerners.  The article refers to the Southerners who suggested African-American enlistment into the Confederate Army as traitors' and scoundrels.' (BKW, 5)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article goes into detail about the laws that had been established previously in 1861 regarding the admission of African-Americans into the Army.  The law stated that the Governor of Tennessee was authorized at his discretion to receive into military service of the state all male free persons of color between the ages of fifteen and fifty.' (BKW, 5)  In addition, the law stated that it was the sheriffs' job to collect names of free African-Americans and give the names to the Governor, should he feel the need to begin enlisting them as soldiers.  However, judging by the article, it appears that the law had not been utilized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Union Army had already been allowing for the enlistment of African-American soldiers into the Federal Army.  In early 1864, Union Gen. Grant requested that one of his commanders organize a black corps.  The recruitment for this corps would start in Tennessee, and then move to Alabama and Georgia.  Although an entire black corps was not created until late 1864, many black regiments started coming into existence well before then.  Because the North had begun recruiting black soldiers (and because the Confederate Army was running low on troops), it would only make sense to some Southerners to suggest enlisting free African-Americans in order to put down the Union.'  However, it is evident that this suggestion was difficult for many to accept."],"display_date":"January 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-01-09","locations":[{"id":12156,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":174,"title":"New Orleans Race Riots\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-10-24","end_date":"1868-10-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Tensions between White Democratic clubs and Black Republican clubs in the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard and heightened fear from whites of a black uprising led to violence days before the 1868 elections.

The most important clause of the amendment, Clause 1, dictated that no state could take away the privileges or immunities of citizens, deprive citizens of life, liberty or property without due process, or deny any person equal protection of the laws.  This amendment was passed over President Johnson's veto by the more radical Republican Congress, and was aimed at the southern states which had used black codes and other measures to strip Negroes of their rights.  It was also used to validate the Civil Rights Act of 1866.&lt;br /&gt;     However, Congress' decision to use the language, No State Shall,' instead of giving the Federal Government constructive power to enforce the provisions of the amendment left the door open for continued racial violence in the South.

The Supreme Court would seize on this opportunity and remove much of the power of the amendment in later years.

Whites started trying to take over these areas (claiming to be looking for lost slaves), and Indians were trying to expand on their already very small territory.  This led to substantial violence and bloodshed.  One such example took place near the Ocilla River on December 6, 1826.  The Woodville Republican charged that the Indians committed a wanon, unprovoked, and deliberate murder in this county'.  General R.K. Call of the state militia was sent in and dealt the Mickasoky and Creek Indians a severe blow.  The Woodville Republican put it simply: We fear the Florida Savages will continue in their mad career until they are entirely extirpated'.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 20, 1827, Joseph M.

These tribes would later reject this proposal at a special conference set up to discuss the terms of this removal.  They saw no advantages to leaving territory that had been theirs for generations and were resistant to any kind of compromise.  This sad tale of hostility foreshadowed the impending Trail of Tears' coming up during Andrew Jackson's term as President of the United States, where the Creeks among with the other four civilized' tribes throughout the South were forcibly marched out of their homelands and to a new and scary terrain.  Indians and whites could not coexist when there was land involved.  The ensuing bloodshed meant that there must be a deal and that deal meant the removal of Indians from land deemed profitable by whites, voluntary or mandatory.

The white Northern press excluded most African American writers, so Wells was forced to create new arguments and tactics.  In an effort to attract attention to the plight of blacks, Wells attacked white fears of declining manliness and blamed those fears as the motivation and perpetration behind lynchings of blacks.    &lt;br /&gt;In 1895, Ida B. Wells released her pamphlet titled A Red Record: Tabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynchings in the U.S. 1892-94.  The pamphlet drew on her rhetoric about declining manliness and described hangings, burnings, and mutilations of blacks, thus revealing the nation's tolerance of cruelty to blacks.  In the pamphlet, Wells claims that it is the white man's civilization and the white man's government which are on trial.'  Through her discourse on manly civilization, Wells showed that white manliness could only be saved and civilization advanced by obliterating lynch law.  The pamphlet and Wells's rhetoric shocked white America and it became quite popular in Northeast cities as well as in Great Britain.  &lt;br /&gt;On April 8, 1895, following the release of Wells's pamphlet, women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony joined Wells at a lecture at the First Baptist Church in Rochester, N.Y.  Wells defended her position that Negro lynching had increased in the South and cited that between 1882 and 1892 1,000 colored people were lynched on slight pretexts, and in many cases, when they were known to be innocent.'  A young Texan theological student echoed the sentiments of many Americans during the time and rebutted that if Negroes are so badly treated in the South, why do they not come North, or go West, or to some more congenial place?'  Anthony and Wells both retorted that the North treated Negroes no better than the south.    Although lynchings did not all together stop with the publication of the pamphlet and Wells' lectures, she was influential in blossoming an anti-lynching movement in the U.S. and Great Britain."],"display_date":1895,"search_date":"1895-07-02","locations":[{"id":14347,"lat":36.7220692336,"lng":-81.9642215133,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":238,"title":"Mary Church Terrell is First Black Woman to Serve on Washington, D.C.

The pack of young lynchers entered her house by breaking in the kitchen door.  Once inside, they destroyed the interior and set fire to the house.  The men were recognized by neighbors as they ran away.  &lt;br /&gt;White citizens of Gretna organized themselves in determination to lynch the gang of white men.

The Comanche and Kiowa tribes realized that the destroying of buffalo on top of heavy military pressure might finally force them completely onto reservations.  In May of 1874 the Comanches performed a new ritual, a sun dance, at the request of a medicine man called Isa-tai.  During this ritual the decision was made to attack white buffalo hunters in the Texas Panhandle.  The attack took place on June 27 when 700 Native-Americans from several different tribes including the Comanches, Kiowas, and the Southern Cheyennes, attacked an abandoned trading post at Adobe Walls that served as camp to the white buffalo hunters.  The Indians held the camp under siege for four days before withdrawing after suffering a number of casualties.  This battle led to the Red River War in which the U.S. Army retaliated by sending five thousand troops to the area that summer.  &lt;br /&gt;An account of a battle is given in The Atlanta Constitution on September 13, 1874.  The battle took place on September 8 when, after a day of small skirmishes between the Indians and the United States troops, the Cheyennes (as they are called in the article, even though the battle included the Comaches and Kiowas, too) retreated to their hiding place on a hill.  The troops led by General Miles charged the hill forcing the Indians into direct conflict.  The Indians were forced to retreat and the battle ended.  However, the article states that the Indians collected their dead, and lit their own villages on fire, which contradicts other accounts of this battle.  Ralph Campbell's Gone to Texas: A History of the Lone Star State states  that although there were few Native-Americans killed, five villages were destroyed and around 1,400 horses were seized or killed.  &lt;br /&gt;The Atlanta Constitution article states:  The moral victory over the first body of hostile Indians encountered lies;in the effect it naturally must have on the enemy in teaching them a practical lesson.'

Indeed, at the Convention there was never any option to vote against slavery. The proslavery forces refused to allow the subject to become an issue.

(Hartzell 135).  The relative lack of Federal interference in these states' legislative actions and nearly nonexistent Republican influence allowed North Carolina and Virginia to pass anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting persons of different racial background from intermarrying.  The Carolina law forbade marriages of whites to blacks or Indians (to the third generation).  The Virginia statute carried a fine of at least 100.00 and a minimum of one year in jail for whites who married blacks, while the marriage celebrant faced a 200.00 fine.  An added dimension of the Virginia law was the encouragement of informing on fellow whites who might be tempted to perform a mixed marriage: half of the 200.00 fine went to the informer.  &lt;br /&gt;Even in more liberal (and federally controlled) states, the rumblings of a highly anti-miscegenation white population could be heard.  Any report of an interracial affair in the South was quickly passed around the community via informal local communications.  Even recognized news channels like newspapers reported instances of racial mixing in other towns and neighboring states, usually with a disapproving tone.  The Charleston News & Courier described the sensation in Savannah' that occurred when a black woman visited the wife of a white man and insultingly informed her that she (the negress) was the party's wife.'  The black woman claimed she had married the white man a year earlier in neighboring Charleston.  &lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the ideal of sexual segregation that proper white Southerners tried to project and enforce was just as much of an illusion in the so-called New South as it had been in the Old.  By 1873, black and white Southerners had been living among each other for well over 200 years, a closeness which produced the inevitable: interbreeding of the races.  That kind of entrenched sociocultural and sexual interaction is difficult to suppress simply for the sake of an ideal, but the Jim Crow South insisted on at least appearing to abide by sexual segregation laws.  Anti-miscegenation laws continued to be updated and implemented throughout the South until the Civil Rights movement nearly a century later."],"display_date":"July 7, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-07","locations":[{"id":9845,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":312,"title":"Segregated Schools Mandated\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-08-31","end_date":"1873-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the first Confederate state readmitted to the Union on July 23, 1866 Tennessee never experienced Federal military occupation. As a result, Tennessee was able to get through Reconstruction with relatively few changes to its state constitution.  In 1873, a majority-white legislature passed a new public school law mandating separate but equal for black students and teachers, supported by property taxes and, ironically enough, poll taxes.  Despite its siding with the Union in the Civil War, the school segregation laws of West Virginia and Kentucky proved that racism was not limited to the Five Military Districts and Tennessee.  West Virginia's updated segregation law provided that separate black schools should only be opened if the number of black students in the district exceeded 15.  Kentucky followed its southern neighbor's example by making it illegal for a white child to attend a black school, and vice versa, in 1873, just five years after it had barred school segregation.  The following year legislators instituted uniform, federally-funded segregation in the education system.  &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, even some unredeemed' states managed to institute separate schools for the races, as evidenced by an August Atlanta Constitution editorial by Joseph Brown criticizing the Atlanta Board of Education and City Council for refusing to allow a local white woman, who had been teaching in the colored system, to transfer into the white schools.  The latter part of Brown's article offers a notable disclaimer to reiterate directly what I have frequently said; that I am not, and never have been, an advocate of social equality between the races; I have always insisted that the races should have separate schools.'  Undoubtedly, millions of white Southerners shared Brown's opinion, believing black students to be inherently inferior in the academic arena, a dangerous and unpredictable social element unfit to mix with white children, or sexual deviants waiting to ravish young white girls on the way home from school (or all three).  &lt;br /&gt;By 1873, the importance of segregation in public education was already commonly accepted in a majority of white Southern states as necessary for peaceful racial coexistence, even in states (like Georgia) which did not yet have a legislated framework for two parallel educational systems.  The legal entrenchment of separate but equal' schools, first seen in two states outside the Deep South and outside the reach of Federally-protected black equality, laid the groundwork for the later institutionalization of Jim Crow segregation in almost every area of social and educational life throughout the South."],"display_date":"August 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-31","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":313,"title":"South Carolina Gubernatorial Election of 1876\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-11-07","end_date":"1877-04-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For the 1876 gubernatorial race in South Carolina, the Democrats nominated General Wade Hampton, one of the state's most popular figures among the white population, and Republicans renominated Governor Chamberlain who was appointed during reconstruction.

A white farmer arrived on the scene and ordered the militia to move aside for their carriage.  Although the militia eventually opened ranks, the next day the farmer demanded to a state justice that the leader of the militia, Dock Adams, be arrested for obstructing my road.'  Adams chastised the justice for entertaining such a complaint and was charged with contempt of court.  Meanwhile, the Black militia again gathered in Hamburg, but this time there was also a large group of white men.  Adams refused to disarm the armory and hundreds of white reinforcements joined the crowd.  The outnumbered blacks attempted to flee, but 25 men were captured and five were murdered in cold blood.  African American shops and homes were also ransacked.  &lt;br /&gt;In South Carolina, the massacre ended any chance of a union between Governor Chamblerlain's Republican and Democratic supporters, and the reconstruction governor would eventually lose to his Democratic challenger, General Wade Hampton, in the election that November , marking the final triumph of Redemption' in South Carolina.  &lt;br /&gt;On the national scene, Democrats viewed the event as an example of how Republican Reconstructionists should not be in control of the southern states.  They pointed out that most of these deplorable events, similar to the Hamburg Massacre, were occurring in South Carolina, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi, where Republicans still had the political power.  Senator William Andrew Wallace of Pennsylvania said in a speech to Congress in early August 1876: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this, I ask, while in States that are still under control of others than the Democratic party in the South the freedman is discontented and riotous, outrages, blood and murder are heard of, the people are discontented and unhappy, taxation is redoubled, and the only right that a white man has there is the right to be taxed?  Why is it that in all these States material prosperity is lessening, prosperity decreasing?  Why is this?  Can there by any other answer than that in the latter the power, the control, the interference of the Federal Government exists, and men are not permitted to govern themselves as we do in the North, regulating and controlling our domestic affairs in our own way?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, newspapers throughout the South, and especially in South Carolina, blamed the event almost entirely on the Black militia.  The origin of the affray was the insolent behavior of a colored militia company,' wrote The Charleston News and Courier.

Hayes in the popular vote and Tilden was declared the winner by many prognosticators.   &lt;br /&gt;The Charleston News and Courier claimed of Governor Tilden's election, we are still assured,' on Thursday, Nov. 10, and newspapers throughout the South continued to declare Tilden the winner through late November.&lt;br /&gt;It became clear, however, that if Hayes lost no more northern states and managed to carry South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, where Republicans controlled the voting machinery, Hayes would emerge with a one-vote victory in the Electoral College and by Friday, November, 10, the New York Times had declared Hayes the victor.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless the battle continued and Republican election boards in the three contested southern states invalidated enough returns from counties filled with election-day violence to declare Hayes the winner of their states and Democrats subsequently challenged the results.  &lt;br /&gt;Black Americans were convinced that in the event of a democratic victory, slavery would be reestablished, while Democrats pledged Tilden or War' and prepared to march on the nation's capital.  Each side was very worrisome of the other and expected the opponent to do whatever possible to take home the election.  I have been like a hen on a hot griddle, since Wednesday , laboring about the election results,' wrote one tobacco merchant from Baltimore.  I feel afraid that Tilden is honestly elected and the morning news has a more cheerful outlook that way.  Still the Republicans do not give it up and I am apprehensive [they will] serve devilish plans to gain the vote of South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida.'  &lt;br /&gt;Eventually a plan was formulated where an independent commission would decide the disputed returns and it was enacted in late January of 1877. It established a body with 15 members: ten congressmen divided between the two parties and five Supreme Court Justices.  Two of the justices were from each party and the fifth was Justice David Davis, an independent.  Meanwhile in Illinois, the state denied their senator reelection and selected Justice Davis in his place. Davis resigned from the electoral commission and Republican Joseph Bradley took his place. By a series of 8-7 votes, completely along party lines, each of the disputed electors was awarded to Hayes, who went on the win the election.  &lt;br /&gt;During this time, to ease fears of Southern Democrats an agreement was made between them and the Republicans that if Hayes' cabinet consisted of at least one Southerner and he withdrew all Union troups from the South, then he would become president , this became known as the second Corrupt Bargain.'

The majesty of the Singers' harmonies and stately bearing stood in stark contrast to African-American minstrel and burlesque entertainment, such as the Georgia Minstrels, which was also popular in Europe and America at the time.

(Edgar 388)  As a result of black Republicans' overwhelming legislative successes (blacks won 255 of the 487 federal and state elections in South Carolina between 1867 and 1876), equal opportunity education was made a top priority.  A government-funded public school system was instituted, albeit with segregated secondary and elementary schools, and the former South Carolina College was re-chartered in 1865 as the University of South Carolina.  Two black trustees were appointed in 1869, and integration of the University began in earnest in the fall of 1873.   In a series of firsts that year, the school hired Richard D. Greener, its first black professor, to teach metaphysics, and subsequently enrolled of then-Secretary of State Henry E. Hayne as the school's first black student.  The school was the only Southern state university open to black students&lt;br /&gt;Integration, however, quickly became a sort of unintended reverse segregation as the last native white professors and students withdrew in protest, leaving only Radical white professors, black professors, and black students at USC.  The lack of a conservative presence earned the school the derisive epithet of Reconstruction University' and School for the Deaf and Blind' among white Carolinians, and white boycotts of the school extended to neighboring states as well. The Atlanta Constitution's educational announcements mentioned nearly every institute of higher education in the South, from Davidson College and the University of Virginia to ladies' finishing schools; nowhere do those ads mention USC and the opportunities it would provide for biracial education.  Meanwhile, editorials in influential papers like the Richmond Dispatch decried any educational funding or policy bill under which negroes shall be admitted upon the same terms as whites' and declaring that, should a Southern state school choose to receive and use federal funding to provide integrated schools, that institution would quickly lose its white patronage.  &lt;br /&gt;USC's brief four-year interlude of integration ended in 1876 with the conservatives' Redemption of South Carolina.  Democrats quickly closed the school in 1877 and reopened it in 1881, again as an all-white institution.  White opposition to integration, especially in higher education, was a powerful force in the postwar South as whites struggled to reestablish their social identity and cultural supremacy in the face of competition from resourceful and capable former slaves.  The University of South Carolina was an anomalous but important experiment which demonstrated that, contrary to contemporary popular opinion, black students could indeed benefit from higher education just as much as white students."],"display_date":"August 1873 - December 1877","search_date":"1875-10-16","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":323,"title":"&#147;Battle of the Giants&#39; , North Carolina Gubernatorial Election of 1876","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-11-07","end_date":"1876-11-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Republican Party was on the defensive for the 1876 gubernatorial election in North Carolina with the issues of reconstruction, Black domination, and white supremacy dominating the campaign.

Other crops formerly produced by slave labor (tobacco, sugar, and rice) also saw steep declines in their prices.  In the heavily agricultural South, especially Black Belt and coastal plantation regions, falling crop prices meant that smaller farmers' credit dried up with their profits, while medium- and large-scale farmers struggled to turn a profit and pay their employees.  Unable to meet their debts, many were forced to sell their land in assignee's sales or had it seized by banks, only to be bought by the same large landowners that had owned slaves before the war.  One such man was Edmund Richardson (Willis p. 13), who bought up seized property along the Mississippi River during Reconstruction until he owned cotton plantations' in 4 different Mississippi Delta counties, with a headquarters' in Washington County; Richardson's land produced over 100,000 bales of cotton per year.  &lt;br /&gt;To work these vast tracts, many former slave owners initially employed black squad labor for cash wages, a system which did not last long.  In the words of the New York Times' correspondent in coastal Jacksonville, Florida, When the war ended, the negroes were without homes.  The old planters owned all the finest lands in the state; They made the best contracts they could with the freedmen to raise their cotton crops [but] the planters had no means, and could scarcely restock their estates, depleted after the war.' Pricey post-Civil War rebuilding, the Panic, and competition for workers in heavily black agricultural areas like the Mississippi Delta and the heaviest cotton counties in the State [of Florida],' made squad-labor prohibitively expensive, forcing planters to find a middle way between squad labor and autonomous black production.' (Willis 33)  Sharecropping seemed to be a good compromise for whites because it maintained the prewar social power structure by keeping blacks dependent on the white elite for land, tools, and credit while simultaneously maximizing crop output by giving workers a financial incentive to produce.  The crop-lien system of agriculture was particularly widespread in the Deep South belt stretching from Louisiana to South Carolina, lasting from Reconstruction until the mechanization of agriculture and industrialization of the New Deal and World War II."],"display_date":"October 29, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-29","locations":[{"id":1328,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":328,"title":"Fredrick Douglass boards train for freedom\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-09-03","end_date":"1838-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 3, future abolitionist Fredrick Douglass successfully impersonated a sailor and gained access to a train ride toward freedom.  Unlike most slaves, Douglass was literate and could therefore taste the pleasures of freedom. This desire was also augmented by his location in the upper south.  While such a position eased some of the burdens of bondage,' it also increased one's knowledge of potential autonomy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglass's account of his mind state prior to the escape is particularly instructive.  In his narrative he describes the conflicting emotions and pulls to both remain a slave, and attempt escape.  He comments that, like other slaves, his knowledge of geography and the distance of his escape route was largely unknown - slave owners portrayed slave territory as endless.  However, lack of a secure plan and potential danger could not outweigh the appeals of freedom, regardless of its remote possibility.  In reference to his mentality and that of his coconspirators, Douglass writes, I believe there was not one among us who would not rather have been shot down than pass away life in hopeless bondage.'  It is clear that the privilege of education played a role in such an assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future impact of Douglass's escape was pervasive.  A skilled and artful author, the writings of Douglass were able to strike an emotional chord with nearly all those who read them.  Douglass released an influential autobiography in 1845, and soon after founded an abolitionist newspaper, the North Star.'  During the Civil War, he served as an advisor to president Lincoln.  Today, nearly all students of racial history read his powerful accounts.  However, his 1838 escape is an example of an event that remained under the contemporary radar.

The new three-story structure, which cost 23,000 and was funded by taxpayers and the new Kentucky public educational system, also responded to a genuine desire of the black community to provide what the local paper called a sound common school education' for its young students.  White citizens of Louisville, not wanting the state to be behindhand as regards the education of the colored people,' agreed that a new, elegant' facility for black students was necessary, as long as their own children remained housed in whites-only buildings.  The fawning Courier-Journal reported that the new school's trustees were all black, which was unusual, especially for a school with such a large number of students (approximately 300 were enrolled, with maximum capacity at 600 pupils).  Often, whites preferred to have people of their own race supervising black educators in order to ensure that appropriate messages and teaching methods were being used to socialize young blacks to know their place' in the community.&lt;br /&gt;Republican control of Kentucky did little to stop the spread of segregation in the state.  Howard Rabinowitz's essay on the post-war shift from exclusion to segregation, rather than integration, sheds some light on the reasons the Republican party of the 1870s chose not to support integration, yet moved forward from total exclusion.  Segregation became a middle ground which allowed politicians to appease white voters and avoid integration while complying with the letter, though not the spirit, of Federal laws barring exclusion and forcing states to provide equal opportunities for their black citizens.  Some black Southerners unwittingly supported segregated schools as a means of taking care of their own, not realizing the precedent such an institution would set.  Indeed, segregation became the symbol of white supremacy in the American South after the Civil War, replacing the plantation big house' and slave owning Master' of the antebellum period, spreading rapidly from education to transportation to consumption spaces like restaurants, shops, and hotels.

Bobo's church was located slightly south of Spartanburg, and his followers came from nearly every local plantation to hear him preach.  Toward the end of July, Bobo's significant congregation had gathered for a kind of revival' which by August 5th had culminated in one of the greatest religious demonstrations ever seen in this country.'  Whites thought the preacher's passionate exhortations, urging his flock to sell all their belongings and follow him at the appointed time, were the ravings of a madman; black churchgoers thought he was the new prophet high in favor' who would lead the children of Zion' to the Promised Land, which he claimed was just 160 miles to the east. &lt;br /&gt;During the first week of August, Bobo announced that the command to march had been received,' and as soon as the oldest member of the group was sacrificed, they would leave Spartanburg.  With a show of violence, local whites managed to save the elderly black woman (who was not opposed to the idea) selected as the group's martyr, foiling one part of Bobo's rather bizarre plan.  Undeterred, his followers immediately sold off the majority of their possessions, packed up their children and food in a single wagon, and began their march.  Witnesses interviewed by the News and Courier reported that, On the march several attempts were made to dissuade them from their folly, but without turning to the right or left, with eyes upturned they went on without making any answers. The last heard of them they were crossing the mountains in the direction of Tennessee.'  &lt;br /&gt;Although Bobo's revival and march were not intended to shed white blood, as Turner's did, several elements in this rather peculiar event merit comparison with Nat Turner's 1831 uprising.

Forty-two years later, the same thing happened in South Carolina to Bobo; the paper dubbed him a Negro of gross ignorance; of very loose morals' whose followers were poor deluded creatures.'  Again, white Carolinians seem to have missed the importance of Bobo's flight: he was leading freedmen out of the land of their enslavement, away from their former masters, toward a new life of possibility.  The Biblical analogy of a prophet leading the Israelites away from Egypt signifies the importance of religion to the black community, much as Turner proclaimed himself a prophet in 1831.  It is, of course, entirely possible that the black mystic named Bobo who led sixty fellow freedmen away from Spartanburg was completely insane; regardless, the event is an important indicator of the continuity of the role of religion in Southern black communities and the mistrust which unexpected black action inspired in the white population."],"display_date":"August 5, 1873 - August 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-06","locations":[{"id":11648,"lat":34.9591922676,"lng":-81.9357757115,"zoom":9,"place":"SPARTANBURG, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":337,"title":"Republican vs. Republican for Mississippi Governor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-09-22","end_date":"1873-11-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 25, the Louisville Courier Journal wrote, The most interesting campaign now in progress in any state is on the boards in Mississippi.'  Why?  First, there was no Democratic candidate in a Deep South State, and second, there were two Republicans , one a scalawag, the other a carpetbagger , running for the position.  In August of 1873, Adelbert Ames was nominated for governor of Mississippi by the radical wing of the Republican Party.  As an ardent and vocal supporter of black suffrage and former governor of the Fourth Military District, Ames's ticket also included a number of black candidates.  Blanche K. Bruce was nominated for United States Senator and Alexander K. Davis was nominated for Lieutenant Governor.  Because he was a carpetbagger (born in Maine), conservative whites despised Ames; his base of support instead consisted of black voters and a small group of radical whites.  His opponent, James Alcorn, was the native, moderate Republican candidate.  A Delta planter turned scalawag turned Republican, Alcorn was preferred by the wealthy planter elite, taken up by the hard-pressed Democrats because he was the Administration's brother-in-law.' &lt;br /&gt;The very lively' race had the added intensity of mutual personal dislike between the two men; according to the Courier Journal so eloquently put it, two Tom-cats tied in a tow sack would have been more harmonious.'  Newspapers at the time felt that Alcorn would be the clear winner of the contest: Ames is no match for Alcorn; Ames will be as mushy as clay in the hands of the robust Mississippian.'  Conservatives disparaged the Radical ticket as not respectable; made up of bummers and dead-beats' and unfairly criticized black nominees, particularly Davis, in an attempt to draw votes away from the more progressive Republican wing.  Their efforts were in vain, however, as Ames soundly defeated Alcorn in the November 4 election, installing the Radical party for its last term in Mississippi's government (1874-1876).  Under Radical Republican rule between 1870 and 1876, Mississippi's taxes increased by 1400%, in large part due to the new state-financed public education system (Skates 116), and black Mississippians were able to truly participate at the highest levels of state government."],"display_date":"September 22, 1873 - November 4, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-13","locations":[{"id":7060,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":341,"title":"Ku Klux Klan pardons issued by President Grant in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-31","end_date":"1873-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The South Carolina branch of the Ku Klux Klan was established during the 1868 Presidential campaign.  The KKK promptly began using violence, including political murders, as a means of terrorizing black voters and assuring a Democratic victory.  Violence and aggression on the part of the KKK toward black voters and Radical white supporters spiraled out of control; in April of 1871, President Grant took the powers given him by the new Ku Klux Klan Act to their full extent, declaring nine counties in the South Carolina upcountry to be in a state of rebellion against the U.S., suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and sending in Federal troops to bring Klansmen to justice.  831 indictments resulted from the crackdown, but by 1873 Grant, along with the rest of Washington, had begun to lose interest in the prosecutions.&lt;br /&gt;In July 1873, Grant decided to drop the whole operation.  He pardoned every Klansman serving jail time, discontinued current prosecutions, and decreed that no new prosecutions should be commenced.'  The above changes did not include active participators in murder or other outrages.'  In a rare show of support for a Republican policy, the Charleston News & Courier praised Grant's decision as highly esteemed; The action of the President does him honor, and time will show that his conduct in the Kuklux matter was as wise as it is generous and just.'  The implications for the freedmen's futures, however, were not so rosy.  The federal government's withdrawal from Klan prosecutions was one of the first inklings of what was to come in 1877, when the government's removal of remaining Federal troops from the South effectively abandoned blacks to Jim Crow.  Grant did manage to destroy the Klan organization in South Carolina, but on a larger scale, his failure to bring violently bigoted whites to justice set the stage for the rise of unabashed racial brutality, especially lynching, during the 1880s and 1890s."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":346,"title":"&#147;Hughes Walks Over the Tracks&#39;\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-30","end_date":"1873-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 30, the Virginia Republican Party's Lynchburg convention, presided over by a colored Williamsburg delegate named Mr. Davison, nominated former Confederate supporter Robert H.

In addition, he encouraged Virginians to cultivate nationalism rather than sectionalism as a means to culturally re-unify the nation, and pushed for the public to accept carpetbaggers in state elected and administrative offices.  Hughes's ideological flip-flop was paralleled by scalawags in many other Southern states, including James Alcorn of Mississippi, many of whom took advantage of the lack of Southern leadership in the Republican Party to appeal both to black voters as the party of Emancipation and moderate whites as better than a Yankee governor.&lt;br /&gt;As can be imagined, Hughes's egalitarian rhetoric, in addition to his political about-face after the Civil War, did not win the respect or admiration of many white Virginians.

Casual articles with headlines like A Rascal Lynched' were fairly common in the newspapers of the 1870s; already, much of the Southern public was blinded with fear and rage at the idea of a black man with a white woman.  A lynching was most likely to occur in cases where a black man had been convicted of outraging' (raping) a white woman, though a lack of conviction did not mean whites presupposed an accused negro's innocence.  In Cairo, Mississippi, for example, a black man arrested for attempted rape of a white girl was taken from the jailhouse by a number of citizens and hanged.'  Threats of extralegal executions for black men were accepted as almost normal when a white woman's integrity and supposed virginity were at stake; many newspaper accounts failed to even mention the suspect's name.  A one-sentence account in the Richmond Daily Dispatch relayed a Mason County, Kentucky incident: A negro was shot dead in Mason County yesterday for rape.'  &lt;br /&gt;But why did rape merit the death penalty only in cases where the accused was black and the victim was a white woman? The Civil War ripped apart the Southern social structure; white men were no longer the unquestioned masters of their region.  The threat of white-black racial amalgamation coupled with post-slavery black competition in social and economic spheres struck fear into the hearts of white men across the South and compelled them to reassert their power over both their' women and the black men who were their competition. During Reconstruction, scattered incidents of lynching foreshadowed its exponential rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Lynchings in 1873 and those that occurred 2 decades later differed only in their frequency and intensity.  By the last decade of the nineteenth century, lynching had become the ultimate public expression of white male dominance, complete with cameras, newspaper announcements, and special excursion trains chartered for urban whites to view the ritual and extended torture of African-American men and even women in rural areas."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":5125,"lat":38.5951990256,"lng":-83.8240569898,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":358,"title":"Maggie L.

Only in retrospect can it be said that Reconstruction began in 1866, as it was not until March of 1867 that Congress passed the first of the so-called Reconstruction Acts that would truly force change in the South.  President Andrew Johnson attempted to veto all three acts, but each time Congress passed the act despite these objections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On July 19, 1867, the third of the Reconstruction Acts gave supreme power to the five Union generals overseeing Reconstruction in the five districts of the South.  Each district included several former states of the Confederacy, with the exception of Tennessee, which was never under military rule.  These generals held the power to remove any official, elected or otherwise, from office if they believed the official to impede rather than expedite the process of Reconstruction.  Understandably, the North felt that the South would try to avoid the obligations stated under the previous Reconstruction Acts, which included holding a constitutional convention to re-write each state's constitution as well as the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Despite the implicit fact that this law was intended to improve the situation in the South for blacks trying to resettle after emancipation, it was widely resented by Southerners who felt that the North was, yet again, attempting to impose their will on the former Confederacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Congress pushed the Reconstruction Acts through, despite President Johnson's veto, they were likely unaware of the repercussions that would result from these acts.  In the South, white citizens would go to extremes including the formation of the Klu Klux Klan and, sometime later, the writing of Jim Crow' laws in order to keep blacks from gaining power.

Under this system, the general in charge of the region in which the state was located would be responsible for making these decisions.  Because President Andrew Johnson did not agree with many clauses in the Acts of Reconstruction, this particular section was bound to be problematic.  In addition, Texas fell under the jurisdiction of General Philip Sheridan, a man who was often at odds with President Johnson.  Within weeks of the passing of the final act of Reconstruction, Sheridan had placed himself in a vulnerable position by removing the governor of Louisiana, James Madison Wells, and immediately taking aim at the governor of Texas, J.W. Throckmorton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Sheridan, a commanding officer of the United States military during the Civil War, had been assigned to oversee the Reconstruction of the Fifth Military District: Texas and Louisiana.  He saw the current governor of Texas, James Webb Throckmorton, as a hindrance to Texas' Reconstruction and therefore ordered his removal only two weeks after the passing of the third Reconstruction Act.  July 30, the day that General Sheridan ordered Throckmorton's removal, it was reported in the National Intelligencer that President Johnson sought to remove Sheridan from his post as the head of the Texas/Louisiana military district.  Shortly after Throckmorton's removal from office, the National Intelligencer's predictions came to fruition when President Johnson had Sheridan transferred from his post and replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Sheridan removed Throckmorton from office on July 30, 1867, it was not until August 9 that he was officially replaced by Elisha M. Pease, a Unionist who Sheridan felt would guide Texas through Reconstruction.  Pease, a native of Connecticut who had lived in Texas since 1833 and had always supported the Union, was recommended to the office of provisional governor by A.J. Hamilton.  Ironically, Pease had run as the Republican candidate against Throckmorton only a few months earlier.  The Daily Dispatch published Special Order No.105 from General Sheridan, which removed Throckmorton from office, announced his successor as Pease, and demanded that he be respected accordingly.'"],"display_date":"July 30, 1867 - August 8, 1867","search_date":"1867-08-03","locations":[{"id":12517,"lat":29.9115260515,"lng":-96.1773201162,"zoom":9,"place":"AUSTIN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":363,"title":"The South Carolina Constitutional Convention of 1895\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-09-10","end_date":"1895-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":null,"display_date":"September 10, 1895 - December 4, 1895","search_date":"1895-10-22","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":365,"title":"Kentucky swears in John Larue Helm as Governor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-09-03","end_date":"1867-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1867 gubernatorial election in Kentucky offered an opportunity for black voters to participate in the selection of a governor.

In the National Intelligencer, updates were published almost daily. Of interest to many newspapers was Alabama's handling of the question of enfranchising voters.  As it was a requirement for states' constitutions to be approved by the national government, Alabama had to handle this situation in a manner acceptable not only too its citizens but also Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alabama Constitutional Convention did not end until December 6, 1867.  The resulting version of the constitution could not be voted on until 1868.  Because of the rules of the Second Act of Reconstruction, the 1868 constitution was not ratified, yet Alabama gained re-admittance into the Union in 1868, despite the problems with voter enfranchisement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not until 1875 that Alabama's constitution was deemed acceptable by the national government.  Interestingly, days before the end of the convention of 1867, on December 2, President Andrew Johnson ordered the removal of General Pope from his position as the head of the Third Military District."],"display_date":"November 5, 1867 - December 6, 1867","search_date":"1867-11-20","locations":[{"id":301,"lat":32.2488115675,"lng":-86.1666274124,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":380,"title":"Black voter turnout swings South Carolina election on Reconstruction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-11-19","end_date":"1867-11-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Under the second Reconstruction Act, state governments were required to have a constitutional convention in order to re-draft their documents with laws that would comply with the end of slavery and beginning of the rebuilding process.

While some states sought to comply as quickly and quietly as possible with what Congress mandated, others resented and rejected the authority of these ordinances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Carolina, which had been the first state to secede from the United States, felt that these acts were not constitutional and sought to have them overturned.  In a critical decision in October of 1867, South Carolina was informed that the Reconstruction Acts were the, supreme law' and had to be followed.  Having been thwarted through one outlet of trying to resist this authority, the state banded together to try and prevent a constitutional convention by other means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Reconstruction Acts, a majority of voters had to cast ballots in favor of a constitutional convention in order to begin the process of drafting this document.  In an effort to prevent the convention, tremendous numbers of white voters in South Carolina registered with the intention of not voting; thereby preventing the convention.  This plan seems to have worked well in Charleston.  According to the National Intelligencer, 3,713 blacks voted in the November 19 election, but only 11 whites.

A letter dated March 16th was printed, in part, in the South Carolina newspaper Southern Patriot and detailed a horrible massacre' of a family at the hands of a group of Indians.  In total four people were killed in the attack and two wounded.  After such provocation as this and other attacks near the Florida border, Andrew Jackson pursued the Indians back into Florida, burning their villages and crops.&lt;br /&gt;Jackson pursued the Indians deeper into Florida, towards St. Augustine.  Along the way, he came across an encampment defended by three hundred and forty negroes' as reported in the National Intelligencer, which he immediately attacked and conquered, where he discovered the leader of the fort was an Englishman, who was promptly court-martialed and executed.  &lt;br /&gt;Jackson soon discovered that the British and especially the Spanish in Florida had been supplying weapons and stimulating the Indians to arms', as the Richmond Inquirer put it.  As a result, on May 24, 1818 Jackson marched on Pensacola and managed to take the Spanish Fort there with little more than a few warning shots.&lt;br /&gt;As word of Jackson's action spread, a stir of controversy shook the nation.  Top officials called for the official censure of his actions.  Henry Clay mentioned in a letter to Charles Tait just after he heard that Jackson had taken Pensacola that he suspected the action was unauthorized, and that it would be imprudent of the President to illegally approve an act of war without Congress' consent.  Still others praised the action, claiming, as the Nashville Whig did, that so long as; Florida remains under the dominion of the Spaniards, our frontiers will be disturbed by Indian incursion'.  Indeed, Jackson himself thought he was merely defending the United States from the Babylon of the south'.&lt;br /&gt;Secretary of State John Quincy Adams who, at the time, was in negotiations with Spain for the territory of Florida, convinced officials not to punish Jackson.  Spain, already weak in the area, took the invasion somberly and eventually seceded control of all of Florida to the United States, wherein Jackson was subsequently appointed territorial governor on June 1, 1821.  He would quit within three months.

Washington founded Tuskegee University, a school created to provide blacks with both a moral and an industrial education. Washington advocated an emphasis on economic self-reliance for blacks, rather than an emphasis on political and social advancement, and he recruited renowned teachers, such as George Washington Carver, to train his university students in domestic, agricultural, and construction work.  By 1900, Tuskegee Institute was the best-supported black school in the country, largely due to donations from Northern supporters.    &lt;br /&gt;Washington was honored and respected by blacks and whites alike by the end of the 19th century.  Many blacks considered Washington an inspirational leader as he encouraged the oppressed blacks to pursue an industrial education as a mode of escape from the system of deprivation and virtual slavery that was set up in the South.  Conversely, Washington convinced much of white America that the industrial education would keep the blacks in a low position.  This notion consoled whites, and, after delivering a speech that later became known as the Atlanta Compromise,' Washington was deemed a talented representative of the Negroes.'  &lt;br /&gt;In spite of Washington's popularity at the end of the nineteenth century, however, he faced much criticism by his more progressive successors, most notably the famous W.

There were only three dissenting votes against these two measures. The first measure urged Kentucky's statesmen in Washington to endeavor Congress to appropriate money and aid, so far is consistent with the Constitution of the United States, in colonizing the free people of color' in Africa. The second measure stated that Kentucky's Governor should send a copy of the previous resolution to all the States' Governors and Statesmen. Since whites were very suspicious of free blacks and loathed the very idea of coexisting with them, Kentucky's action was very typical of this time period. To solve this problem humanely, many advocated colonization of freed blacks and many colonization societies were founded to promote this idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example of one of these colonization societies was founded in December of 1829 in Nashville, Tennessee. To promote the formation and expansion of colonies of free slaves in Africa, many prominent Nashvillians joined together and formed the Tennessee Colonization Society. Philip Lindsley, head of the University of Nashville, was made president of the society. This event reveals that anti-slavery sentiment had already made its way into the south by 1829 and that prominent citizens were beginning to take a philanthropic view towards slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few people knew what to do with the rising number of free people of color and even fewer people knew what to do about the moral issue of slavery. During this period there was a flourishing of Colonization societies and colonization sentiment because colonization was seen as a humane solution to the free black problem.' In other words, the people of the United States, especially the South, could not imagine a society of peacefully coexisting free blacks and whites, and colonization was seen as a humane way to avoid a race war. Unfortunately, the resettlement and transportation of former slaves to Africa was not only costly but few slaves desired to make the perilous and long journey. Due to being highly unfeasible and costing a great deal, colonization never became a widespread practice."],"display_date":"January 1, 1829 - January 30, 1829","search_date":"1829-01-15","locations":[{"id":4822,"lat":38.1429651724,"lng":-84.9082120384,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":392,"title":"Black Ministers Gather in Columbia to form a Suffrage Committee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-07-10","end_date":"1895-07-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As racial tension mounted throughout the South, many black citizens felt that voting the only way that African-Americans could achieve racial equality.

She ordered the assistance of General Manager Thomas, who promptly ordered that a separate car be arranged for her.  Harding refused to enter the separate car and filed a law suit against the company.  Later that afternoon, a black organist, Miss McLemore, attempted to board the ladies coach of the Lousiville and Nashville Depot, but she was denied access until all of the white passengers had been switched to a different car.  Like Mrs. Harding, McLemore refused to enter after the events took place.    &lt;br /&gt;In 1881, half of Tennessee's lower house was occupied by Republicans, four of whom were blacks.  The blacks had previously attempted to overturn a law instituted in 1875 that prohibited blacks from suing discriminatory railroads.  They failed by a narrow margin, and their attempt was immediately followed by the 1881 segregation statute that required railroad companies to provide separate cars for first-class black passengers.  The statute ordered that the black passengers must abide by the same rules issued to the white passengers, and it stated that the new cars must be properly maintained. The statute was significant in that it proceeded Plessy vs. Ferguson in being the first of the separate-but-equal law.  &lt;br /&gt;Railroad segregation played a major role in Southern history as railroads became the reluctant scenes of the first state-wide segregation laws in the South.  Travel by railroads allowed for blacks and whites to ride in close proximity, which upset many white Southerners.  They feared that close interaction would enable the blacks to rise in society, and they felt a need to extend the color line into daily life.  Many states established railroad segregation laws to do so.  The railroad companies were not eager to enforce such laws.  The laws complicated their job, and they would have preferred interracial seating.  &lt;br /&gt;Ayers notes that, in reality, the Tennessee statute in 1881 did not require segregation; it merely required that railroads provide separate but equal accomodations that blacks had the priveledge to enter and occupy.''

At the time, the Readjuster party was gaining force in the Southern states as it challenged the conservative Democrats and posed a threat of division amongst the Republicans.  General William Mahone, a well-known capitalist, a former Democrat, and a former Confederate general, led the Readjusters in Virginia.  Promising an end to black proscription and increased educational support for both races at all levels, he unified poor blacks and white farmers of Virginia.  In 1789, he won control of the Virginia legislature and altered the tax distribution in order to ensure that farmers would pay less, while big corporations would pay more.  &lt;br /&gt;With the introduction of the new party, confusion arose concerning party loyalties. For this reason, blacks assembled at the Petersburg convention.  Many politicians initially assumed that the blacks would remain loyal to the Virginia's Republican party, which was relatively weak at the time.  The convention, however, concluded that, though the blacks ought to retain their support for the National Republican Party, they would throw their support behind the Readjuster Party for state politics.  The blacks insisted that the Republican Party in Virginia was not pure, and they believed the Readjuster Party would better settle the race conflicts, which they believed were damaging the prosperity of Virginia.   &lt;br /&gt;The Readjuster party was remarkably successful.  The years 1880-1884 witnessed the highest amount of independent voting in the history of the South.  The party achieved its greatest success in its state of origination, Virginia, where it allied with a wing of the Republican party to gain control of the state by electing William Cameron, the Readjuster candidate, to the governorship position.

He encouraged the South to utilize all available resources, including the blacks.  Though Harris used his Uncle Remus stories to demonstrate that blacks had stories of value within their own valuable culture, his stories still depicted race relations unrealistically by portraying blacks as happy and child-like, which added to the stereotypes instilled by the blackface performances.  Harris was inevitably influenced by the racial attitudes that prevailed in the South, and his writings reflected a local color.

However, due to uncertainty of facts of the case, an official decision was not made.    &lt;br /&gt;The case of Edward Stokes demonstrates disenfranchisment.

One such measure was disenfranchisement, whereby the whites took the ability to vote away from the blacks.  In this process, Southern states, beginning with Mississippi, enforced literacy or property qualifications, leaving loopholes for white men who might be restricted by these new laws.  In addition, states in the South employed a poll tax that was tactfully designed to prevent blacks from paying the tax.  As demonstrated by the Stokes incident, this policy was implemented in South Carolina.

The News and Courier demonstrated the need for such a rebuttal, stating The most the Readjusters can bring against Daniel is the false position which his enemies have placed him in in regard to the public schools of the State.'  Thus, Daniel noted the benefits of public education, listing that they were the cheapest means of providing education to all classes and races.

In addition to showing his personal support for education, Daniel asserted the support of the Democratic Party for the system of public education.  The speeches explained the actions of the Democrats in order to clarify their support for education, and they attempted to negatively portray the Republican Party as well. &lt;br /&gt;Public education was an important topic in political debate towards the end of the nineteenth century, especially in Virginia as the state government had to deal with Virginia's enormous debt.

By 1881, Virginia residents desired a strong public education system.  Because all children were in need of education, discussion of public education served as a guise for incorporating the race and class issues into politics.  Each party accused its opposition of apathy in terms of providing sound public education, and both parties sought to convince dubious voters of their sincerity on the issue.&lt;br /&gt;Daniel was ultimately unsuccessful with his campaign.

To make himself clear, he warned that any recruiter who enlisted black soldiers would be arrested and possibly imprisoned.  Despite Sherman's orders, however, former slaves continued to enlist in the army in other areas of Georgia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite strong coaxing from others, Sherman refused to change his attitude on the matter.  Even Lincoln reminded Sherman that there was a law in effect regarding black recruitment into the Union Army, and that because it was a law, all must follow it.  Sherman claimed to have the highest regard for the law, but refused to change his mind because he believed his view represented a large portion of Union soldiers.  By the early summer, the claim that the Northern war was a failure was no longer valid, and so Sherman continued to ignore Washington's pleas that black soldiers be included in white armies."],"display_date":"June 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-03","locations":[{"id":1820,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":443,"title":"Cleburne Recommends Enlistment of Blacks into Confederate Army\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-02","end_date":"1864-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In mid-1863, the Confederate Army and Confederate Congress decided that steps needed to be taken toward strengthening the Confederate Army.  In a meeting with other Confederate officers in early January 1864, Gen. Cleburne suggested something that seemed like a logical and rational solution to the problem: enlist African-Americans into the Confederate Army.  Out of this idea grew the proposal to arm slaves, as well as the proposal to emancipate slaves as a reward for their service.  Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was strongly opposed to the proposal and refused to forward it to Confederate President Jefferson Davis.  However, the proposal did have some support (it was signed by 13 other officers), and so another officer forwarded it to Jefferson Davis instead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jefferson Davis did not feel did not feel that the military situation in early 1864 was enough to warrant such an extreme measure as allowing African-Americans into the Confederate Army, and so he asked that the proposal be suppressed.  When Cleburne heard of Davis' reaction, he did not mention the proposal again.  Less than a year later, Davis, moved by circumstances and events, proposed to the Confederate Congress the arming of slaves.  This proposal was very similar to Cleburne's proposal.

President Jackson's destruction of the Bank of the United States had resulted in uncontrolled speculation, and frontier people were clamoring for more land.  This was in spite of the 1832 Treaty of Cusseta, which stipulated that individual Creeks be given a parcel of 320 acres if they decided to stay in Alabama.  But neither the Alabama state legislature nor the settlers respected this agreement.  Speculators and settlers bought land from the Indians for much less than it was worth.  Some Creeks resigned themselves to this forced displacement and emigrated west.  Others resisted removal; finding themselves dispossessed of their land, the non-compliant Creeks adopted the practice of stealing livestock from the frontier people, especially those near the Florida border.  Skirmishes between farmers and small bands of Indians became a common occurrence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of May 15th, a sizeable contingent of Creeks made an attack in Georgia for the first time.  After crossing the Chattahoochee River from Alabama, the party raided the town of Roanoke, killing several whites and burning their homes.  The Southern Recorder reported: There were 70 or 80 persons in the town, including a small company of infantry under Capt. Horne... the number of the enemy being ascertained (about 300) it was thought prudent to retreat, which they did in disorder.'  Unable to overtake the retreating settlers, the Indians decided to return to the town and burn it to the ground.  A number of those who had escaped alerted a military encampment of the attack, but by the time a group of militiamen made it to the hamlet, the Indians were gone.  The Recorder reported that at least seven whites and five blacks were dead, with 15 people missing; the Indians lost only three of their number, while the rest crossed back into Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reports of Indian hostilities' and depredations' became more and more frequent, considerably heightening the distress of those whites who were already dealing with Seminole disturbances in the Florida territory.  When it became clear that federal troops were too busy with the Seminoles to take care of the Creeks in Alabama, Governor Clement C. Clay called out the state militia to bring peace to the area.  This conflict, which came to be known as the Second Creek War, continued into 1837.  Once the resistance was finally crushed, the only Creeks allowed to remain east of the Mississippi were those who volunteered to fight against the Seminoles in Florida."],"display_date":"May 15, 1836","search_date":"1836-05-15","locations":[{"id":2390,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":457,"title":"54th Massachusetts regiment sent to South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-28","end_date":"1863-05-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The first African American regiment, this group left Boston to head south to Port Royal, South Carolina, to fight for the Union army and demonstrate the capabilities of black soldiers.

Not all Northerners were enthusiastic about black soldiers however. Two African American regiments were attacked in Washington by a band of Pro-Slavery ruffians.'&lt;br /&gt;The regiment did not succeed at first, but news of their valiant effort brought increased recruitment among the black community. Their efforts help sustain the Union's war effort, and slaves began to escape from their masters in the Northern slave states, so that they could enlist and fight. The success of this regiment led to the commissioning of Major Stearns to recruit African American soldiers nationally.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the commanders welcomed the new recruits. Major General N.

However, acceptance of the soldiers was not universal among fellow military men. Observing an African American regiment fighting in New Orleans, one author observed that the coexistence of colored and white regiments had led to much agitation and dissatisfaction,' and that some white officers have threatened to kill the first colored officer that offers to assume in any way military authority in their presences.' In Baton Rouge, a soldier from Connecticut argued, God never made [African-Americans] soldiers, or any thing to make soldiers of.' In addition, it dampened morale among some white soldiers as they asked themselves, What are we fighting for? Is it to raise the negroes to an equality with white men?'&lt;br /&gt;Southerners were shocked by the enthusiasm of Northerners to black soldiers, discrediting their belief that the children of Ham possess singular aptitude for the profession of arms.' The South expressed its paternal attitude towards slavery, attacking the North for assigning the blacks in uniform the post of honorable danger;thrown forward to receive the murderous fire of the brave Confederates.' They also fault the emancipated soldiers for buying into the Northern ideology: he does not penetrate the motive that actuates his Abolition friends in endowing him with qualities and qualifications that he himself knows he does not possess.'

The members of the Virginia General Assembly felt that the bill would unlawfully limit the rights of the states and that it would cause damage to whites and blacks because of its sectional' nature.

In 1820, the Creeks were being paid 25,000, but 22,000 was set to expire in 1829. The Creeks that did emigrate settled in the area of Muskogee County, Oklahoma. In typical U.S. style, 300 US troops were positioned near the peaceful emigrants (Phoenix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1829, the number of Creeks that had already emigrated west of the Mississippi was about 1400. Of this once mighty nation there were only about 15,000 left in the South. The Cherokee Phoenix and Indians' Advocate believed that the Creeks had a greater disposition to emigrate, than among the Cherokees; and it is possible that the whole tribe will at length consent to remove. Sadly, though, many Creeks had sought to become civilized' as they had been told by the United States, and many had even become wealthy slave and plantation owners.

The only remaining problem was as to the time of removal.' For the Creeks this time of removal came ever closer with the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

Hose escaped from Palmetto, Georgia, where the crimes took place, but was captured the following day in the neighboring town of Griffin by the Jones brothers. Citizens of Griffin wished to execute Hose immediately, but it was decided that he should be taken to the sheriff in the county seat, Newnan, so that the Jones could claim the reward that had been offered. &lt;br /&gt;          The train carrying Hose to Newnan was packed with people who were eager to witness the man's execution. As soon as Hose was off of the train, a huge mob crowded around him and marched him to the jail, cheering and shouting along the way. Plans were made to take Hose back to Palmetto for his execution; however, several prominent members of the community spoke out, pleading with the mob to allow justice to take its course. Governor Candler ordered even ordered out the troops. Upon hearing this, the mob decided that the execution needed to take place immediately and within minutes, Sam Hose was hanging from a tree. &lt;br /&gt;          Hose's execution was extremely brutal. Hose initially refused to confess, but after his ears were cut from his head, he claimed responsibility for the crimes. The Atlanta Constitution reported that 2000 witnesses watched as he was burned alive and his body cut and mutilated. Peculiarly, the man responsible for dousing Hose's body and clothes in kerosene was a stranger from the North, who was reported as saying that, though he did not know how people from his part of the country would respond to this, he felt the need to avenge the terrible crimes that had been committed. For sickening sights, harrowing details and bloodcurdling incidents, the burning of Holt is unsurpassed by any occurrence of a like kind ever heard of in the history of the state'.

Strickland denied the accusations, but it was believed that he would be hanged regardless. The involvement of more than one black laborer led many to believe that Cranford's murder was part of a widespread conspiracy on the part of blacks. However, those present at the execution reported feeling relieved and comforted by the fact that Hose was so quickly apprehended and executed. &lt;br /&gt;          Coverage of the story varied tremendously from publication to publication, with whites typically portraying Hose as a vicious murderer, while blacks pointed out that he was never given a trial or proven guilty of the crimes which he was accused of.

Blacks fought what seemed to be an impossible objective as they sought out equality in a predominately white world.  Nevertheless slow and steady progress was being made as African American advanced in social, political, and economic arenas.  These establishments brought with them the wrath of Southern white fear and prejudice.  What happened on November 3, 1883 in Danville, Virginia was a horrible example of an all too familiar bias that dates back to slavery.&lt;br /&gt;The Danville Riot of 1883 was spurred by white fears in the political spectrum.  The 1883 Virginia statewide elections featured a political party that had in the past been relatively successful.  The Readjuster campaign took an aggressive approach to winning the support of its followers.  For this year the Readjuster ticket had promised three distinct changes: Negro schools, an asylum for Negro insane, and abolition of the whipping post' (Melzer, 12).  The night of the third, a meeting was held by the Coalition Rule in Danville,' a group comprised of several prominent white men who denounced the Readjuster campaign (The Post, 11/4/1883, 1).  A crowd of black men soon congregated outside which inevitably resulted in an altercation.  After the meeting an African American shoved one of the members and tempers quickly escalated.  Even though the man apologized, many white men had already drawn pistols.  A scuffle ensued resulting in seven black men dead and two whites injured (NY Times, 11/5/1883, 1).  The military arrived shortly there after and the crowd dispersed.&lt;br /&gt;Much damage had been done, but many of the effects of the riot were not apparent until after the elections.  Whites patrolled the streets after the riot with shotguns in an attempt to keep fear and submission in the hearts of African-Americans.  The propaganda proved effective when the polls were tallied as 31 of the 1,300 blacks registered to vote submitted ballots (Ayers/Willis, 142).  The result was a landslide victory for the Democratic Party.

Martial law was declared only after years of the state Government appealing for peace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Governor Holden was empowered to declare martial law by the Shoffner Act of 1869 and was backed by President Grant. During the Kirk-Holden War, as it became known, Holden refused to recognize the writs of habeas corpus. Although the troops never fired a shot, more than 100 men were arrested. The violence during the Kirk-Holden War was far less than the violence leading to the war. On November 10, 1870, Holden proclaimed to the state Senate that the insurrection had been officially put down."],"display_date":"June 8, 1870 - November 10, 1870","search_date":"1870-08-24","locations":[{"id":9318,"lat":36.393360631,"lng":-79.3336688399,"zoom":10,"place":"CASWELL, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":551,"title":"Governor William H.

Hon. Samuel Pasco, the long-time chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee, was elected to be President of the convention unanimously.  Because Florida was a relatively new state at the time, many of its delegates were not native-born.  However, they were considered to be a largely competent group representing a myriad of interests throughout the state.&lt;br /&gt;The new constitution that this body formed , a product of much political infighting and dissension -- greatly weakened the power of the governor, namely by increasing the residency requirement, forbidding a second consecutive term, and making the cabinet elected as opposed to appointed.  In addition, it made most offices at the state and local offices elective, as well as strengthening the power of local officials.  Last, and most important, it mandated the use of a poll tax as a requirement for voting.  &lt;br /&gt;The latter alteration was the direct result of a compromise between smaller black belt' counties who wanted to see all their county offices elective and those of the large and prosperous counties who did not wish the administration of their counties in the hands of people who had very little stake in it.  The resulting system was that certain important county officers would be appointed by the governor (with the consent of the Senate) while the majority of other officers would be elected, with the reassurance that a poll tax would be the prerequisite qualification in such elections if the people communicated such a wish to their representatives in the legislature.  Undoubtedly, this led to the further disenfranchisement of African-Americans within the state.  &lt;br /&gt;Ratified by 31, 804 to a 21, 243 vote, the Constitution drawn up by the 1855 Florida Constitutional Convention fashioned the model of state government which was to last until 1968.

They did so after being accosted and, eventually, arrested for resisting the orders of the ferry's personnel to remove themselves from the section of the boat reserved for whites.  Their suit was based not only on a charge of wrongful arrest and imprisonment but, more significantly, on the relatively recent federal Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination within the states on account of race.  Importantly, the two men made sure to fashion the legal argument in their suit in such a way so that it would be more amenable with the reasoning of the line of recent Supreme Court decisions unfavorable towards similar suits by African-Americans.  The litigants claimed 100,000 in damages.    &lt;br /&gt;Cases of this character happened to be occurring quite frequently throughout the South at the time.   During that same year, two similar federal appellate court cases took place, involving both a black man named Murphy and an unnamed black woman.

Interestingly, the federal judge concerned in both cases ruled in favor of the African-American litigant.  The logic of their rulings were quite similar , although both verified the legality of segregation, they both stipulated that the separation involved cannot result in an inequality of the good and services received.  They both ruled that as long as black passengers of railroads paid the same amount of money as their white counterparts, they were to receive the same accommodations under the law.  &lt;br /&gt;Not only did these cases reflect a growing propensity for African-Americans in the South to assert their rights under the newly-instituted federal civil rights laws crafted precisely for that object, but it also marked an increasing trend amongst judicial decisions in federal courts throughout the South of enforcing truly equal accommodations for segregated blacks."],"display_date":"November 23, 1885","search_date":"1885-11-23","locations":[{"id":5934,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":568,"title":"Indians and Kansas-Nebraska\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-15","end_date":"1854-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Capitol Hill, Sen.

Congress passed the amendment by two thirds; there were 119 in favor, 56 opposed, and 8 not voting.  The approval of the amendment meant that it would be sent to the states for ratification.

People's lives all over the country changed as slaves were freed and began their own lives.  However, the ongoing war over slavery between the North and the South had divided the nation, and Lincoln understood that the best decision for the sake of the country was to push the Amendment for immediate ratification.

Between the years of 1833 and 1843 Scott lived in Illinois (a free state) and a part of the Louisiana Territory that barred slavery under the Missouri Compromise of 1820.  When he returned home to Missouri, Scott claimed that after living in a free state he had become a free man and was no longer a slave.  Scott's master, Mr. John F. A. Sanford, claimed that Scott was still a slave under Article III of the Constitution.  Scott filed a petition in the St. Louis Circuit Court in 1846 and after eleven years of idling in the American judicial system, the case reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1856.&lt;br /&gt;Delivering the opinion of the Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled in a 6-3 majority that slaves were not and could not become citizens of the United States and thus were not afforded any civil liberties under the Constitution.  Under Article III, persons of African American descent were not citizens of any state at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and were instead considered beings of inferior order' by the drafters of the document.  In regards to the Declaration of Independence's claim all men are created equal,' Chief Justice Taney stated, as reported in the Richmond Daily Dispatch, It is too clear for dispute that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, for in that case, the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would be flagrantly against the principles which they asserted.'  &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the court ruled that, under Article V, it could not deprive any man of life, liberty, and property' and since Scott was in fact a slave and not a citizen, he was the lawful property of his owner, regardless if he was in a free state or a slave state.  Therefore, Scott was still a slave according to the law.&lt;br /&gt;In the second time ever, the Court used its power of judicial review to rule an act of Congress (the Missouri Compromise) unconstitutional.  The Court declared that it was beyond the constitutional powers of Congress to enact a law regarding the territories of the states.  Congress could not deprive citizens from taking their property (i.e. slaves) into and out of territories or states.&lt;br /&gt;After the infamous decision was handed down in the spring of that year, a flurry of reactions erupted across the United States.  Democrats were as quick to defend the decision as Republicans were to assault it. Many northerners felt that parts of Chief Justice Taney's decision, specifically declaring the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, were extrajudicial because they were not necessary for arriving at a decision in the case. Northerners charged that after Chief Justice Taney had shown that Scott, as a Negro, had no right to bring a case into a federal court, he should have ended his decision. Some Northerners went as far as to say the decision was a pro-slavery conspiracy.  Southerners, for the most part, stood firmly by the decision of the Court, refusing to concede that any part of Chief Justice Taney's decision had been extrajudicial. Relationships between Northerners and Southerners were already tense, but the Dred Scott decision served to further polarize the two sides.&lt;br /&gt;Frederick Douglas, a prominent African-American abolitionist, remarked after hearing the decision: The highest authority has spoken. The voice of the Supreme Court has gone out over the troubled waves of the National Conscience. But my hopes were never brighter than now.

But he also added that this was an empty promise unless the rule of law was maintained throughout the land, claiming that his right was barren and worthless;unless sustained, protected, and enforced by appropriate police regulations and local legislation.'  &lt;br /&gt;Douglas praised the decision of the Court because it maintained popular sovereignty and self-government of the citizens of the United States.  He believed that if the signers of the Declaration had intended to declare the negro equal to the white man, would not they on that very day have abolished slavery in every one of the states of the Union in order to have conformed to that Declaration'  In the end, Douglas's speech won more praise than criticism and he continued to preach his thoughts, which eventually evolved into the Freeport Doctrine during his debates with Abraham Lincoln the following year.  Many southerners sympathized with Douglas and supported his opinion of the Dred Scott decision, while Northerners tended to side with Lincoln."],"display_date":"June 12, 1857","search_date":"1857-06-12","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":611,"title":"Southern Reaction to Lincoln&#39;s Speech on &#147;Amalgamation&#39; in Springfield, Illinois","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-06-26","end_date":"1857-06-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech in response to Senator Stephen Douglas's speech on June 12 in Springfield, Illinois.  Lincoln noted a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people, to the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races.'  He assured his audience that although the Republican Party deemed the Declaration of Independence's famous line all men are created equal' to include blacks, he most certainly did not want to vote, and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes'  He stated that just because he does not want a woman negro as a slave does not mean that we would prefer to have her as his wife.  Thus, Lincoln favored a separation of the races by excluding slavery from the territories and urging them to resettle somewhere other than the United States.&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln had strong strategic political motivations to support amalgamation.  Lincoln was desperately eager to prevent border slave states such as Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri from leaning toward the Democratic Party. Lincoln was acutely aware that if the issue of the upcoming election (and eventual Civil War) was openly about slavery, his chances of retaining border state support (and eventual support within the Union amidst the outbreak of the Civil War) were slim. Moreover, during the time of the Civil War Lincoln knew that many people in the North were vehemently anti-black and saw themselves as fighting to save their country rather than to free slaves.  In the end, Lincoln helped to elevate slavery as a prominent issue during the latter half of the Civil War and eventually helped to formally declare the slavery to be unconstitutional under the Thirteenth Amendment."],"display_date":"June 26, 1857","search_date":"1857-06-26","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":622,"title":"Fugitive Slave and Author Delivers Speech in Glasgow, Scotland","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-06-02","end_date":"1857-06-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Andrew Jackson was a slave living under the lash in Sumter County, South Carolina.

He settled in Salem and worked part-time as a sawmill operative and leather tanner.  When Jackson mailed a letter to his former master in South Carolina asking to purchase his family members, a slave agent was sent to find him and return him to Sumter County.  Jackson avoided capture, however, and fled to Canada wit the help of Harriet Beecher Stowe once the Fugitive Slave Law was passed.  &lt;br /&gt;Jackson wanted to educate others about the incredible sufferings and toils of black people under slavery in the United States.  He did this by publishing his own book in 1862 entitled, The Experience of a Slave in South Carolina, and traveling to other countries to give lectures and speeches on slavery in the US.  In the summer of 1857, Jackson traveled to Glasgow, Scotland to give a speech at the Scottish Exhibition of Arts and Manufactures Connected with Architecture.  The chairman introduced the lecturer Mr. Jackson as an intelligent-looking black, in the prime of his life, with a peculiar broken dialect of a negro' although he did a round, unvarnished tale delivery' of his captivity and escape from slavery.

This gave free blacks an alternative to the colonization sponsored by the American Colonization Society.  The Liberian colony which the Society sponsored was diseased and overcrowded, considered by many to be a death trap.'  &lt;br /&gt;Colonization had long been a project of abolitionists and slave-holders alike, often resulting as much from a mistrust of freedmen as from the opinion that colonization would be most beneficial to free blacks.  Opinions differed on whether it was even possible for free blacks and whites to coexist in American society.  Northern opponents of abolition had argued early in American history that liberated, propertyless, black men and women would become a burden on society.'  Free blacks on the whole seemed to oppose colonization, and some abolitionists viewed it as a means to strengthen slavery by exporting all the free blacks.  The American Colonization Society itself was a target of abolitionist ire.  Garrison, a former advocate of colonization, wondered how the Society was advancing the cause of immediate emancipation.  He also saw it as something which reinforced racism.  The Society's efforts enjoyed a surge of popularity in the 1830s after Nat Turner's rebellion, but then this support began to wane as finances decreased and as absolute emancipation and full citizenship continued to gain ground in the anti-slavery movement."],"display_date":"March 18, 1840","search_date":"1840-03-18","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":658,"title":"Southern Newspapers Report on Slave Abduction Controversy in Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-08","end_date":"1840-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the first half of the nineteenth century, slaveholders were becoming progressively more stubborn partisans of their peculiar institution.  This was happening throughout the South to different degrees.  This stubbornness manifested itself in national politics and the increasing anxiety over inter-state relations concerning slavery.  As northern abolitionism became stronger over the next few decades, there was more often trouble with northerners interfering with the southern institution whether through the government or on an individual basis.  In the Baltimore American in January, there was an article commenting on the controversy between Maine and Georgia over the abduction by two citizens of Maine of a Georgian slave.  Southern slaveholders demanded the protection of their property, but northern states had a good states rights basis for refusing to cooperate in matters of fugitive slaves.  The American was pleased in this case to be able to say that the correspondence between the two states had thus far been conciliatory.'&lt;br /&gt;Despite cases of slave abduction and rescue, the North as a whole was not abolitionist.  Free blacks in the north faced the prospect of being arrested and returned as fugitive slaves according to the 1793 national fugitive slave act.  The abolishment of slavery in northern states did not necessarily mean that these states were safe for runaway slaves.  The increasingly firm stance of southerners would in fact precipitate the passage of the new Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, and dialogue on the fugitive slave issue would become increasingly unconciliatory over the two decades following the controversy between Maine and Georgia in 1840."],"display_date":"January 8, 1840","search_date":"1840-01-08","locations":[{"id":5930,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":669,"title":"Blacks are requested to enlist for volunteer service in the Spanish American War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-04-01","end_date":"1898-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At the beginning of the Spanish American War, Secretary Alger sent a bill to Congress requesting 25,000 blacks to enlist and support the war effort.  Alger was backed by many other political figures that wanted to create separate black forces.  It was thought that blacks would be a valuable addition to the forces in terms of physical strength and supposed immunity to tropical diseases.  At the same time many southern blacks were eager to enlist.  Eventually, Congress called for four black and six white regiments.  A number of black men from Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Virginia and the Ohio Valley enlisted, although the majority never saw any combat action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horace Wayman Bivins, a black man from Virginia enlisted in Troop E in the 10th cavalry.  The description of his experience enables us to imagine what life in the army was like for black soldiers.  Bivins' regiment originally patrolled throughout Montana, Wisconsin and Illinois were they were treated like royalty by civilians black and white civilians.  Once the tenth cavalry was transferred to Chickamauga, Georgia in the spring of 1898 he noted a stark contrast in the treatment of black soldiers in the South.  Rather than being met with applause and parades, they were forced to use separate restrooms and eat in different lunchrooms than their white counterparts.  Eventually Bivins saw direct combat action in Cuba and San Juan.  In a letter to a friend he illustrated the pride and excitement of the black soldiers, writing, ;I am fighting for humanity as we march on;to defend the emblem of eternal liberty and justice, the stars and stripes, the flag of our Great Republic;there is no people on earth more loyal and devoted to their country than the Negro.,'  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus despite the harsh treatment that blacks had endured in the United States for over a century, they remained loyal and proud to the country.  What is even more telling is the fact that although blacks were not worthy to use the same toilet as white men in South in 1898, the government had no problem sending black men to fight next to white men.  Regardless the ability of black men in battle was positively regarded.

The editor sarcastically suggested that if Jim Crow cars were necessary, Jim Crow laws then must be enacted in other public arenas such as waiting saloons, eating houses, and jury boxes.  He went on to suggest establishing two or three Jim Crow counties at once and turning them over to;colored citizens for their special and exclusive accommodation.'

The majority of whites at the time feared blacks possessed too much power and therefore supported decreasing the black vote through disfranchisement. One family in South Carolina, The Tolberts, stood in stark contrast to the majority and supported black rights. As a result the Tolberts controlled the Negro vote and exercised a significant amount of power over the Republican Party. In the election of 1898 R.R. Tolbert, a candidate for Congress, garnered a large amount of Negro support. In order to assist blacks in overcoming the barriers of disfranchisement, members of the Tolbert family placed Republican ballot boxes at voting locations convenient for blacks throughout South Carolina. <br /><br />Violence ensued when Mr. Ethridge, a respected man in Phoenix was shot dead after he attempted to take the control of the ballot boxes away from the Tolberts. Next a group of armed white Democrats physically attacked Thomas Tolbert for collecting black ballots. The majority of whites claimed that the blacks had brutally killed a faultless man, while conversely the blacks believed that their right to vote was threatened. A race riot ensued, with blacks running to the defense of the Tolbert family. Bloodshed and death resulted on both sides. <br /><br />On November 9, 1898 four Negroes were lynched in front of a crowd of 500 white men for their involvement in the riot. After the lynching a group of 50 armed white men came together to seek vengeance on the blacks and the Tolbert family. On November 10, 1898 two more blacks were brutally killed in public. After the lynching, the enraged white crowd began to search for the Tolberts in hopes of subjecting them to similar acts of violence. Despite the violence of the majority of white men in Phoenix, the Tolbert family was blamed in the popular press for the entire incident. When asked his side of the story, R.R. Tolbert insisted that Etheridge was killed accidentally by white Democrats, and that a misunderstanding caused the riot. While two of R.R Tolbert's brothers were held captive in Columbia, R.R. himself fled to Washington D.C. By November 14, 1898 the riots had ended. Phoenix town representatives met to show that it was not the intention of any white men in Greenwood County to harm innocent black men.

Many blacks were employed gainfully in the community as artisans, policeman, and fireman.  Rather than look at this positively, white men were intimidated by blacks and thus considered Wilmington the city of lost opportunity' for white men.  Regardless of the fact that the majority of blacks in Wilmington were upstanding citizens the popular opinion among whites was that the blacks were dangerous.  Many white men were specifically afraid of black men raping white women.  Furthermore whites were angered at the insurgence of political participation by carpet baggers' and negroes.'  As a result many white men made it their personal mission to prove that blacks were socially inferior to whites.  In response to the white supremacist sentiment, the editor of The Record, the black newspaper in Wilmington published an editorial blaming white men for the fact that white women were often raped.  This was the last straw for the white democrats in Wilmington.  Soon after the publication, nine white men came together and formed the Secret Nine.'  The group's purpose was to cooperate with the North Carolina White Supremacist movement to protect their homes and their city.  The Secret Nine planned to revolt the day after the state election.  They worried that the Republican ticket would prevail and thus the city would fail to progress.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the relief of the Secret Nine the Democratic candidate, Charles B. Ayock, was elected as the North Carolina Chief Executive.

The citizens then drew up a declaration of White Supremacy demanding that the editor of The Record, leave Wilmington immediately, and further demanding that the most gainful employment be reserved for whites.  The resolution was sent to Negro leaders.  While awaiting a response armed white men assembled throughout the city with rifles.  They then marched to The Record burning it to the ground.  Inadvertent shots were fired injuring white men.  A large scale riot ensued between the black and white civilians.  Ultimately the editor of The Record was banned from Wilmington, and white supremacist sentiment prevailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wilmington riot occurred nearly 35 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Although the blacks in 1898 were legally free' they were still considered inferior to whites.  Thus it seemed that the domination of the black race had shifted from a physical domination to a sort of economic and social domination.  The riot stood to eliminate the Negro as a political factor in Wilmington.

The resolution, written by Witten McDonald, goes on to give the United States government the range of reasons why possessing the land would be beneficial, including arguments such as the sooner the Indian is surrounded with the guardianship of laws which protect the weak, the better for him' (3), as well as because every branch of financial and industrial business in the East would feel perceptibly the increase of markets which an opening of the Cherokee outlet would afford' (4).

The New York Times ran the headline Another Negro Burned' and reported the story of the allegations raised against Henry Smith. A week prior to his lynching, Smith was reportedly seen carrying three-and-a-half-year-old Myrtle Vance, through the city of Paris, Texas, telling onlookers he was taking her to the doctor's office, when all along he had lured her to him with a piece of candy.

Whitecapping in Mississippi specifically refers to using violent tactics to force African American farmers to leave their farm land and their homes. Farmers living in poverty because of widespread agricultural problems were usually the culprits of this type of violence. When a farmer was forced to give up his land because of too much debt, local merchants acquired the land and often hired African-Americans to farm the land. Poor white farmers were angered by the fact that African-Americans were farming the land that another white farmer had been forced to give up and they took out their anger on the African-Americans by using whatever means they had to force them to leave. &lt;br /&gt;The issue came to a head on May 5, 1893 when over a hundred white farmers interrupted the proceedings of the court in Jackson, Mississippi by surrounding the courthouse, pistols in hand.

However, the acts the imprisoned whitecaps were arrested for were acts of arson on buildings inhabited by humans, acts which were not allowed bail in Mississippi at the time. Local citizens were outraged at the nerve of the men who thought they could overrule the law with intimidation and violence. The good citizens of the county are aroused, and publicly denounce the actions of the sympathizers of the prisoners' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution.

Affects of the Civil War had created a dominant middle class, as well as a strong African American vote, in Clarke County. When the 1892 elections for Governor of Alabama arrived, most Clarke County residents supported one of two political parties- the Democratic Party or the Farmer's Alliance. The race for governor between Democratic candidate, Thomas Goode Jones, and Alliance-backed candidate, Reuben F. Kolb, promised to be a close one. Local newspapers enhanced the dramatic race by publishing warnings from the Democratic Party, stating that Misrepresentations and falsehood are the chief weapons of the Kolb party' (2). Conflict began immediately after the election, with claims that Jones' victory was the result of illegal actions, such as ballot stuffing. The front page of the Birmingham Age-Herald reported, just days after the election, that The political situation in Alabama is critical and the gravest fears of the leaders of two legislatures and two state governments from present indications, may be realized' (1). Democrats carried the black vote in Clarke County, infuriating citizens of the rural precinct of Mitcham Beat, who had turned to the Alliance after feeling ignored by their own local Democratic Party. This group of citizens of Mitcham Beat, secretly named Hell-at-the-Breech, didn't have a loyalty to the Alliance, either, but voted that way simply to be accepted politically. When the Alliance began reporting lawlessness on the part of white men in Mitcham Beat, the men took out their frustration with violence.     &lt;br /&gt;The murder of elite Democratic Party member Ernest McCorquodale, allegedly over McCorquodale's foreclosure of a Hell-at-the-Breech member's farm , was investigated, but never solved after all suspects were found to have alibis. Not long after, in June 1893, a black man, William Howze, was murdered outside of Mitcham Beat for mistreating a white woman. When the black man's brother was accused of the same crime a month later, two prominent citizens of Clarke County stepped forward to prevent his lynching. When the Hell-at-the-Breech posse confronted an upper-class store owner in a neighboring town over allegations that the store owner had mistreated a boy from Mitcham Beat, leaders of Clarke County saw connections between McCorquodale and Howze's murders. The Mayor stepped in to protect Clarke County around the same time that McCorquodale's death was avenged by the murder of Hell-at-the-Breech member, Lev James. Soon after, Hell-at-the-Breech members' names were given by tortured members and, to make a point, the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot one of the most prominent members of the group, Quincy Bledsole. Although this ended the reign of Mitcham Beat's Hell-at-the-Breech, the bitterness of the working class would live on in Clarke County."],"display_date":"June 1, 1893 - August 30, 1893","search_date":"1893-07-16","locations":[{"id":83,"lat":31.6766489025,"lng":-87.8308040287,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":761,"title":"Governor McMinn of Tennessee explains his Treaty with the Cherokee Indians to the state legislature\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-10-12","end_date":"1817-10-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In explaining the treaty to the legislature, McMinn focused also on the relationship between Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as both of their relationships (and that of the United States) with the Cherokees.

He encouraged the Tennessee legislature to enact laws to guard the poor against the watchful speculator' (Raleigh Minerva), since there would now be a lot of new land available that the Cherokees had given up in the treaty.

Their letter to Congress was very condescending to the blacks who they were trying to help.  They noted that despite the fact that in Africa they had had access to large tracts of land, fertile soil, and other rich natural resources, they had made no progress in the refinements of civilization'.  They hoped that by re-colonizing them in Africa, they would be able to convert more people on that continent from their gross and abject superstitions' to Christianity.  Other groups had similar ideas.  The American Society for the Return of Negroes to Africa was founded in Richmond in 1817, with a stated mission that was nearly the same. ","Congress examined the proposal thoroughly.  They decided that any proposed colony would have to be far away from American soil to have the intended effect of separating free blacks from the enslaved blacks, and from the free whites, with whom they can never be equal.  The point of this separation was to diffuse any conflicts that might erupt should the free blacks get frustrated with the injustice and turn to violence.  So if the land must be far away, where would it be, and how would the government obtain it?  Great Britain already had a colony for free blacks in Sierra Leone.  The Congress discussed sending free American blacks to that colony, as well as creating a new colony just for American freedmen.  A new colony would require a rather large monetary contribution from the United States government for the land on which to build the colony, and food until they were able to establish their own farms, as well as military protection for a long time before they could set up their own stable government. Once they did set up a stable government, would the new nation wage war against the oppressors of their brothers, still enslaved in the United States?  If there were an American free blacks colony near a British free blacks colony, how would this affect America's relations with Great Britain?  The Congress posed many questions in their joint resolution, and came to conclusive answers on only a few.  In the end, they decided to talk with Great Britain about the possibility of sending American freedmen to their colony in Sierra Leone before making any further recommendations."],"display_date":"January 14, 1817","search_date":"1817-01-14","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":787,"title":"Fire in Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-11","end_date":"1861-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A huge fire broke out in the city of Charleston on December 11, 1861.

Close to 600 buildings 540 acres of the city burned, including five churches.  Negro shanties' may have been included in the count, exaggerating the damage, according to the opinion of the New York Times writer.

Most importantly, this new law greatly reduced the number of polling places available in counties consisting of a majority of black people.  By doing this, blacks were forced to travel long distances to be able to speak their voice on political issues.  The General Assembly justified this clearly discriminatory act by pinning the North as its impetus. &lt;br /&gt;In a long treatise by Edward McCrady, a member of the House of Representatives at the time, McCrady painstakingly, and meticulously states the justification for such a Jim Crow law.  He assures that these blacks were not educated enough to be entrusted with the vote, and that this was not the fault of the south, but that of their Northern neighbors.  McCrady announces that it was crazy that such a servile and ignorant race' was injected into legislative halls at the point of the bayonet.'  Moreover, McCrady goes on then to quote heavily from the constitution and from a number of different amendments to assure the public that the House of Representatives does indeed have the power to enact such a law.  He assures that the 15th amendment only indirectly' had the effect of producing new voters within the South, and that its ultimate enactment still ran through the individual states. McCrady's argument then goes on to infer that until the blacks become as educated as their white peers, they shall not receive an equal opportunity for vote.&lt;br /&gt;However, the well-educated McCrady's carefully argued explanation was certainly not the only way that bigoted whites kept blacks from the polls in the years after reconstruction.  Violence, threats, and fraud also played a critical role in the post-reconstruction culture.  In many towns, blacks were threatened with loss of employment or eviction to keep them away from the polls , and many were warned to not even be caught heard discussing local politics.  In addition, many armed white men, dressed in special uniforms, patrolled the areas in front of voting booths to shoot off their guns if any black man stepped forwards to vote.  In conclusion, the South Carolina act is significant as it affirms that 1877 was a critical turn away from the improvements towards equality made during reconstruction, and that blacks would struggle with suffrage rights for some time under the new auspice of Jim Crow' laws."],"display_date":1877,"search_date":"1877-07-02","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":815,"title":"Congress passes act continuing operations of the Freedmen&#39;s Bureau until January 1869\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-07-11","end_date":"1868-07-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Freedmen's Bureau was a federal agency created in the aftermath of the Civil War that aimed towards aiding newly freed blacks by providing them with some education and working to integrate them into the labor force.

It was formally defeated in October of 1853 by a referendum in which every county in the state of Delaware voted against it.

Upon arrival in the city, referred to by Civil War historian James McPherson as the “communications center for abolition,” Knight and Hughes were met with hostility and resistance, rather than cooperation or even legal compliance, with the Act.","William and Ellen Craft had escaped their master’s hold two years prior, in December of 1848. Ellen, being the offspring of an African American woman and her white owner, had sufficiently light-skin as to cross the color-line, disguised as an ailing white man, after obtaining the proper attire and cutting her hair. With William posing as Ellen’s servant accompanying his master, the couple traveled on a variety of steamships and trains inconspicuously even though stopping in several slave-holding areas, such as Charleston, SC, Wilmington, NC, Fredericksburg, VA, and others before finally crossing the Mason-Dixon line into Pennsylvania.","Soon after the couple settled themselves in Boston, the Crafts became involved in the active abolitionist efforts in the city. With a firm community of members in Beacon Hill, the Crafts found themselves swept up in abolitionist lecture circuits throughout the area. Unfortunately, such activism naturally increased the risk of discovery, as they told the story of their disguised escape to fellow campaigners. Thus, when the Fugitive Slave legislation passed, the Crafts’ owner knew exactly where to find the pair.","While Section 5 of the Fugitive Slave Act required that “..all good citizens [were thereby] commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law..” the reaction to Knights and Hughes was anything but. Theodore Parker, the chair of the Vigilance Committee, (the primary organization in Boston created to aide fugitive slaves, which had increased by 100 members since the arrival of the two slave catchers) hid Ellen in his home, placed William in a separate safe haven, and ensured that both blacks were guarded by at least one armed white. Additional members of the committee filled the town with notices depicting the “two prowling villains,” “the pursuing bloodhounds,” as they were described.","Yet the truly extreme abhorrence for the Fugitive Slave law among these Boston abolitionists was seen in the multiple arrests of Knight and Hughes. The two were arrested on October 26 around 3 p.m. by Deputy Sheriff Coburn, according to <em>The</em> <em>Farmer’s Cabinet, </em>on charges of slander against William Craft. After making bail, both men were again arrested some hours later, this time for conspiracy to kidnap the Crafts, accordingly in clear violation of the new legislation. Bail for each arrest was set at $10,000, and it remains unclear who posted such bail, yet speculation has been made, namely that John H. Pearson (a noted pro-slavery acquaintance of the men) and Patrick Riley (US Deputy Marshall) had a hand in assisting the men in this manner.","President Fillmore upon hearing of these actions, which effectively drove Knight and Hughes out of the city by October 30, warned the Bostonians of his inclination to send federal troops to the city to enforce the law, and assured the Crafts’ owner that he would be provided with any and all support he desired to attempt the recapture a second time.","Fillmore failed to deliver on such promises, however, as the Vigilance Committee was determined not to yield to legislation they believed immoral in all aspects. Members placed William and Ellen Craft safely on a ship destined for Liverpool by December of that year, enabling the couple to successfully continue their plight speaking out against the evils of slavery, and leaving the Bostonians to view the event as a victory among the context of the larger sectional crisis."],"display_date":"October 25, 1850 - October 31, 1850","search_date":"1850-10-28","locations":[{"id":6209,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":602,"tag":"Transportation/Migration"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":833,"title":"Southern disdain for Stowe&#39;s A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-07-01","end_date":"1853-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1853 Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the companion to her famous novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, and she titled it A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.

While Stowe claimed that she understood that slaves were more than property, she postulated that other whites still saw slaves as sub-human.  Stowe did admit that she did not fully understand blacks, but she thought that by applying Christian kindness to them, their situation might be helped.  One shocking thing that Stowe revealed was that she believed that slaves repulsed themselves; she wrote that they thought they were evil because their skin was black.  She did not think that blacks were capable of reaching the same intellectual and moral heights as whites, and she blames that inability on their disgust in themselves.  Southerners were not at all pleased with Stowe's book.  Critics characterized it as having a narrow field of view.  She was accused of making generalizations about Southerners as being unaffected by the plights of slaves.  This bothered critics who felt that Southerners were not deficient in their morality.  One critic tried to explain that the North had the same prejudices as the South.  He wrote wherever man is found, we find equally the same vices, crimes, and weaknesses.   Southerners were also alarmed at the lack of biblical references in <em>A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  They felt that she was writing too righteously not to be using the Bible.

Sheriff Johnson and Deputy Sheriff Wilcox were able to stop the train in Kentucky and went forward to arrest both Mark Johnson and Hut Barton , both black men.  &lt;br /&gt;According to the Courier Journal, the two police officers, fearing retaliation by these two men, felt that handcuffs were a necessary precaution.  Soon after, though, scores of black men on board the train rushed forward to try to stop the arrest and to rescue both Johnson and Barton.  Some sources believed that the arrest was a simply a retaliatory measure against Mark Johnson because the police believed that he was linked to the death of an Irishman from Guthrie, named Jeffcot which had occurred several months prior.

With blacks now free from traditional slavery and with an increase in ready cash, the historian Frances Simkins claimed that there use of alcohol, and alcoholism, increased.  Simkins recounts that the black lower classes' new-found access to alcohol scared many local officials as they believed the blacks were the cause of the profanity, vagrancy, murders, and assaults' which permeated Southern streets on average Saturdays now.

Nearly fifteen hundred Union troops, mostly African-Americans, fought side by side against the two or three thousand Confederates stationed there. However, there still was not racially equal treatment of the soldiers, as the white soldiers rode forward on horseback, before retreating to the relative safety of the rest of the Union infantry. &lt;br /&gt;This battle was also one of the few fought with extensive hand-to-hand combat, with soldiers attacking one another with bayonets and clubbed muskets. Soldiers described it as the most gruesome and one of the bloodiest battles they had ever witnessed: Upon both sides men were killed with the butts of muskets. White and black men were lying side by side, pierced by bayonets.' Naval artillery was used to assist the Union troops, but poor communication ability caused frequent mistakes, and friendly-fire casualties resulted. Despite the presence of naval forces, the Confederates pressed on, running upon the Union troops. After several hours of fighting, the difficulties in aiming the gunboats was resolved, and the success of the naval firepower in attacking the Confederates swiftly drove them away. Despite the Union victory here, they lost more than three and a half times as many soldiers as the Confederates did.&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. Assistant Secretary of War commended the bravery of the blacks at Milliken's Bend,' for they extreme capability, contradicting earlier views that black soldiers were inferior.

One account of the battle reads, [The commanding officer] ordered [an African American soldier] to have the men load their guns at once. He instantly replied: We have done did dat now, massa.' Before the colonel was ready the men were in line, ready for action.' As word of their abilities traveled, many become more accepting. Southerners remained skeptical of the joint efforts of black and white soldiers fighting together.

The proclamation decreed that slaves in the rebellious counties of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were to be set free. Those territories excepted were those over which the Union army had seized control during the Civil War. The list of states was notable, because although Tennessee had rebelled, it was excepted from the enumeration of affected states.&lt;br /&gt;The simple language of the manumission of the slaves was not terrible effective in its own right. The proclamation did only apply to those areas in which the Confederacy governed. One northerner described the government as having no power to enforce the decree;the paper is a dead letter.' However, the declaration that the government would recognise and maintain the freedom of such persons' was a much more promising measure since this clause would have a tangible effect at the conclusion of the fighting. Not even all Northerners were in agreement with his proclamation, suggesting that the President may free slaves so far as may be necessary to the success of his military operations,' but that any further freeing of slaves would enable the President to gain de jure control over the law of slavery.' &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln saw emancipation as a measure of expedience in a war-torn nation. In a letter to Horace Greeley, he expressed his ambivalence: If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.' The Emancipation Proclamation was no surprise to the country. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation noting that on January 1 of the subsequent year, he would issue the statement that he did. He was not held to that promise, however. His local paper gave him some leeway: He was perfectly free to exceed or to fall below the line of conduct marked out in his preliminary proclamation of September 22d.'&lt;br /&gt;Besides its primary purpose in renewing enthusiasm towards winning the war, the act was a major step in the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States, making abolition a national issue central to the Civil War, and it give interested parties around the world reason to take note. The major effect of this proclamation came about as the Union took control of Confederate states and freed the slaves therein. In addition to adding a dimension of morality to the way, it also attracted international interest as a statement on human rights. The Southern perspective of this event, however, was drastically different. Lincoln's speech, described as the world's most pitiable spectacle,' was vague' and visionary' and had already failed in practical application.' The South was amenable to a discussion of compensated emancipation, but outright rejected Lincoln's notion that he either ought to or had the authority to emancipate their slaves."],"display_date":"January 1, 1863","search_date":"1863-01-01","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":919,"title":"The Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment&#39;s Attack on Fort Wagner\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-18","end_date":"1863-07-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["July 18, 1863 marked the first time an all-black regiment fought in the Civil War.  The Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment composed of only blacks and led by abolitionist Robert Gould Shaw, attacked Fort Wagner in a Union attempt to gain control of Charleston Harbor in Charleston, South Carolina.  During the recruiting process of his regiment, Shaw experienced a difficult time attempting to recruit blacks from other states to fight in his regiment due to the fact that only men from Massachusetts could receive state aid for their families if they fought in a Massachusetts regiment.  Consequently, this policy discouraged black men from other states from fighting under Shaw.  &lt;br /&gt;Along with the duty of fighting to end the Confederate stronghold on Charleston Harbor, an additional role of the Fifty-Fourth Regiment was to provide cover for the Fourth South Carolina Calvary once the cavalry was deployed at Lighthouse Inlet in Charleston.  It should be noted that although the Fifty-Fourth did fight under the Union Army, they were not always taken to kindly by even their Federal allies in other regiments.  For instance, Captain Thomas Pickney of the Fourth South Carolina Calvary admitted his disgust at fighting alongside blacks regardless of the fact that blacks were providing protection for Pickney and his comrades.  During battle, Shaw was killed leading his men on, and the Fifty-Fourth Regiment's attack ultimately proved unsuccessful due to the overpowering numbers of the Confederate Army.

Robert Scott, a white Republican from Ohio was elected governor. While Scott and the Republicans held the authority, the leaders of the white community would prove to hold the real power in South Carolina. &lt;br /&gt;Between November 1870 and September 1871, members of York County Ku Klux Klan scheduled weekly night rides that terrorized the civilian population. In 1871, Governor Scott, however, declared that he had no need to suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion. Governor Scott had not hesitated to dispatch state militia to combat violence in 1869 and 1870, and it was evident that Scott was clearly reversing his policies. Governor Scott refused to declare martial law as he had done in the past. The white Ku Klux Klan community had grown too powerful and the Governor held the militia back in order to prevent bloodshed. In March 1871, Governor Scott finally decided to disband black militia units in Union, York, and Chester counties in a compromise with whites that they would do everything in their power to try and restore law and order. The federal governments responded as well, by dispatching troops to South Carolina, but the soldiers were severely outnumbered and represented only a potential threat. &lt;br /&gt;The Ku Klux Klan violence in South Carolina represented terrorism on a scale that was previously unknown.

Many problems plagued the public school system at the time, including necessary funding and the inclusion of African-Americans into the system. &lt;br /&gt;The state did not have enough money to fund the school system in 1871. In order to get funding, the state issued three modes of taxation for public schools that required schools to be partially funded by a county tax. County school districts were not eligible to receive state money if the county did not provide some of the funding. In Henrico County, not one African-American cast a vote, for or against, the local school tax when it was put to a vote because most of the African-Americans in Henrico were not property owners. The white voters determined the local tax would be initiated in Henrico County and as a result the white voters essentially allocated all of the tax revenue to the white schools. &lt;br /&gt;The state also had to determine how it would allocate its teachers. The Richmond Board of Education session of 1871-1872 needed to decide on how to allocate its teachers. It needed twelve teachers for white schools and fifteen teachers for Negro schools. The teachers with the highest scores on the teacher examination were sent to the white schools and the teachers with the lowest scores were sent to the Negro schools. During this time period it seemed improbable that a competent teacher would end up teaching at a Negro school.

Although there impossible to determine the exact number of African-Americans who emigrated from the South during the exoduster movement, it is estimated that 60,000 exodusters settled in Northern states from 1873 to 1880 with approximately 20,000 settling in Kansas alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Responses to the exoduster movement varied sharply, with African American leaders, working class African-Americans, and white planters all responding the movement in sharply divergent tones.

This occurred on December 8, 1879 when former congressman Jeff Long urged attendees at meeting in Forsyth, Georgia not to leave for the North.  For their part, the organizations headed by the white economic elite from Louisville Kentucky, to East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, sought to repress the movement by concocting dubious stories about the suffering of blacks in Northern states, and by making accommodations with their black workers.

Moreover, Indians choosing to relocate would be reimbursed for any improvements made on their lands and, according to the Enquirer, were to be aided in their transportation and to receive subsistence for the first year.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primary force behind this Act were southern states such as Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi who had large Indian populations within their boundaries and who were conflicting with the Indians over matters such as rights to natural resources, settlement, and legal jurisdiction. These conflicts came to a boiling point in Georgia especially, where the discovery of gold within Cherokee territory sparked a huge rush of miners to the area. This brought to light an equally important issue of legal jurisdiction over the Indian territories, which to this point retained some degree of independence despite state government claims of sovereignty. In the Niles' Weekly Register, for example, Georgia Governor George Gilmer is quoted as saying that the powers vested in the executive department by the constitution and laws do not sufficiently enable the governor to remove or restrain such trespassers.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Indian Removal Act sought to put an end to these conflicts, therefore, by relocating Native American tribes and ensuring states sovereignty over the lands within their boundaries. In a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe, a Washington D.C. newspaper, President Andrew Jackson justifies the Act saying that it will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites;; (and) enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and under their own crude institutions.' Despite removal being voluntary, however, in saying the Indians have crude institutions' and later in calling them savage tribes,' Jackson's letter shows the latent racism of many American whites. It is this racism and the desire for access to the rich lands occupied by Indian tribes that eventually led to forced removal and events such as the Trail of Tears.'"],"display_date":"May 28, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-28","locations":[{"id":6076,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1046,"title":"Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-09-27","end_date":"1830-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the Choctaw Indians of Mississippi and the U.S. Federal Government on September 27, 1830. Dancing Rabbit Creek was the first official treaty signed under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, an Act which allowed the President to negotiate with Indian tribes living within the boundaries of existing U.S. states to voluntarily exchange their lands for unorganized territory west of the Mississippi River -- mostly in what is now Oklahoma -- as well as to be assisted in the move and to be reimbursed for any improvements on the abandoned lands. This treaty is of great significance because it started the process of Indian Removal to the mid-West, at least on a more centralized, federal level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, the main tenet of Dancing Rabbit Creek treaty was to exchange the 11 million acres of land in Mississippi currently occupied by the Choctaw tribe for approximately 15 million acres of land in what is now Oklahoma. Interestingly, an article in the Richmond Enquirer on September 14, 1830, states that it was at the request of the Indians' that negotiations were opened. The Enquirer goes on to note we are glad to hear' of the presence of the Secretary of War at the negotiation -- a comment which says a great deal about the sentiments of many Americans at the time should Native-Americans decide not to accept voluntary' exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Removal Act and subsequent treaties such as Dancing Rabbit Creek were designed to lessen tensions between white American who were pushing into Indian territories, and to resolve boundary and jurisdictional disputes between Indians and the governments of the states in which they resided. As President Andrew Jackson puts it in a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830, the waves of population and civilization are rolling to the westward; and we now propose to acquire the countries occupied by the red men of the south and west by a fair exchange.' Jackson acknowledges it will be difficult for the tribes to relocate, but he likens the Indians move to when European settlers first set foot on the unknown shores of America and argues that it will be better for all involved."],"display_date":"September 27, 1830","search_date":"1830-09-27","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1050,"title":"Georgia Gold Rush Report\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-10-09","end_date":"1830-10-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Georgia Gold Rush peaked during the fall of 1830 when additional large quantities of gold was discovered in previously unsurveyed Cherokee territory, specifically in what became Lumpkin County. As a result of the discovery thousands of persons' entered Cherokee territory employed in taking great quantities in value of gold therefrom' according to a statement from Governor George Gilmer printed in the Niles' Weekly Register. Though Georgia at first attempted to remove these prospectors, tensions continued to mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem for Georgia was that Indian tribes at the time existed as semi-independent states within the boundaries of existing U.S. states. Historian Louis Masur notes in his book 1831 that the Georgia General Assembly passed law after law asserting its own sovereignty over the entire state,' but the Cherokee were very reluctant to uproot. As a result, the events in Georgia became an important factor behind the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which allowed the President to negotiate with Indian tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi River. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian Removal and access to Indian territories for white settlers also became an important political issue in Georgia. An advertisement in The Federal Union on September 29, 1830, for example declares No Reserves of Gold Mines No Indian Testimony Against White Men Wilson Lumpkin, for Governor.' The problem was simple: gold and other resources had been discovered on a huge tract of very rich and fertile land that was inaccessible only because it was occupied by people who white Americans at the time saw as uncivilized savages. It did not make sense to a growing America to ignore these valuable lands in the middle of existing U.S. states, and so events such as the Georgia Gold Rush helped lead to the Indian tribes being voluntarily or not so voluntarily relocated to different, less valuable territories."],"display_date":"October 9, 1830","search_date":"1830-10-09","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1055,"title":"Meeting of the American Colonization Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-18","end_date":"1853-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During its thirty-sixth annual meeting on January 18, 1853, the American Colonization Society delivered its annual report at the Four and a-half street (Presbyterian) church.' The gathering was opened with prayers and it was announced that, a general review of our operations the past year is calculated to produce the conviction that the Society is growing in usefulness with every passing year.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ACS, founded in 1816, was dedicated to promoting the expatriation of free black populations to Liberia. ACS members tended to be Southerners and although they claimed to have the interest of free blacks in mind, declaring, we must go to them in the true spirit of benevolence, and not give over until they arouse themselves and be men,' they were actually largely motivated by self-interest. The members of the Society feared that increasing population of free blacks would organize revolts an destabilize the United States and members who were northerners were concerned that free blacks in the North would be willing to work for less money and would thus lower the wages of white workers. Additionally, in promoting the removal of blacks from the United States and their colonization in Liberia, the ACS was angling for the beginning of what they hoped would become an American empire in Africa. At their 1853 meeting, their address asserted, the interior [of Africa] has never been penetrated in any manner calculated to throw open its treasures or reveal its wonders to the gaze of the world; colonization has planted a footstep on the western coast, and opened a gateway through which the vast recesses of the interior may be reached and revealed.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the American Colonization Society professed to be interested the welfare of blacks, it was essentially an organization based on racism the end of slavery did not change its ideological outlook. Typical of its time period, despite being anti-slavery, the ACS still believed that blacks were inherently inferior to whites and did not advocate social or political equality of the races. Its mission and goal place their own racist views and self-interest before those of blacks. Even though many blacks were reluctant to leave the United States and those who left for Liberia were often unhappy, the ACS published propaganda to counter those views and attract recruits. In statements released to the press, the ACS boasted that the affairs at Liberia are in a prosperous and thriving condition' and the emigrants are getting on through their acclimation finely' in spite of evidence pointing quite the opposite direction."],"display_date":"January 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-18","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1056,"title":"Maryland Deals with a Growing Free Black Population\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout 1830, the number of slave holders in Maryland was declining, and those who remained were fighting a losing battle to maintain control over the state government. In 1830, white slaveholders consisted of only 35% of the white population of Maryland, yet controlled 60% of the seats in the state legislature -- a fact which was all to prevalent to many anti-slavery whites and to free blacks. Most of these slaveholding whites lived in the southern, peninsular parts of Maryland, and they were opposed by the more urban northern parts of the state. Henry Brawner, for example, lived in Charles County where 57% of the population was enslaved and he himself owned 58 slaves worth over 30,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was in direct contradiction to northern Maryland where 35% of the non-Baltimore black population was free, the number within Baltimore itself being even higher. This shift in northern Maryland is evidenced by looking at Maryland's different newspapers and in the reactions of white slave owners. For example, the Annapolis-based Maryland Gazette lists a number of runaway slave notices, as well as a May 13, 1830, advertisement to purchase one hundred likely negroes.' This is directly contrasted by the Baltimore based Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser, where one is hard pressed to find a single such notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White slave owners reacted to this growing free black population -- and the general anti-slavery liberalization -- of northern Maryland in a number of ways. Henry Brawner, for one, chaired a committee which urged the expulsion of free blacks from the state. In addition, both whites and some free blacks pushed recolonization' of blacks back to Africa as well as what the Baltimore American calls on January 14, 1830, the African colony in Canada.' This debate over what to do with Maryland's free black population continued throughout 1830 and the following decades, especially as the number of white slave owners fell in proportion to the more anti-slavery -- or at least anti-domination by slave owners -- northern Marylanders who begun to take more control over the state government."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":5971,"lat":38.28057998,"lng":-77.0012385843,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1061,"title":"After frost falls on the ground on October 24th and 25th the Memphis yellow fever epidemic is officially declared to be at an end.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-10-24","end_date":"1879-10-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After months of one of the worst yellow fever outbreaks of the 19th century, the Memphis outbreak of 1879 is officially declared to be over after frost kills the germ.  While the event had immense national significance, the gravity of the yellow fever outbreak to the city of Memphis cannot be overstated.  Although the causes of the outbreak were uncertain at the time, many people pointed out that the spread of the fever was aided by the lack of adequate sewage system in the city of Memphis. The outbreak of 1879 came on the heels of the yellow fever outbreak of 1878 in which almost 90% of Memphis's 20,000 residents became infected, and fully one quarter died.  The city of Memphis was threatened with extinction as commerce came to a halt under the tight quarantine imposed upon the city, hundreds of citizens fled the city and appearing in The Courier-Journal of Louisville declared Let Memphis be Burned.' Despite the grave threat posed by the yellow fever, with the end of the outbreak in October, commerce resumed and the city continued its rise to one of the commercial major hubs of the Mississippi river.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the outbreak had immense consequences for Memphis it also had a significant impact on the national level.  With individual cases being reported from New Orleans to New York, paranoia set in across the nation causing the National Board of Health to issue a protocol for disinfecting materials exposed to the outbreak.  Moreover, fears of the epidemic quite possibly motivated Louisiana's politicians to create a state board of health in article 178 if the constitution of 1879.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, the response to yellow fever outbreak also spoke volumes about race relations in 1879.  Because death rates were substantially higher for whites than for blacks (the mortality rate was under 7% for blacks and over 70% for whites in the Memphis outbreak of 1878) African-Americans became easy scapegoats for the outbreak.

The convention's relatively high level of organization and involvement in higher education show the extent to which the Southern Baptist congregations had grown together more tightly since the Southern Baptist Convention had begun in 1845 as an organization to coordinate missionary activity.  Moreover, the mention of 64,000 white Baptists portrays the disunity between the white Southern Baptist Convention, and the black Baptists churches that had developed after the civil war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting aspect of the convention is the role played by women in religious life.

In Nelson County, W.C. Carrington announced his candidacy in a letter addressed broadly, To the voters of Nelson County.'  Carrington had been a Confederate soldier.  Elsewhere, on the day of the October 22 election, John L. Marys, Jr. and Frederick C.S.

The Readjuster Party won the election on a platform of repudiating state debt, expanding education, and promoting the interests of African-Americans.  They framed their message around rhetoric of class conflict that contrasted the interests of average Virginians against the interests of wealthy bondholders.  This message was reflected in a pamphlet of the 1878 Readjuster Platform that stated that, The bondholder shall pay taxes as well as the farmer and the laboring man,' and that, The money assessed to free schools shall not be stolen from the treasury and given to the bondholder, but shall be sacredly applied to our schools white and colored.'   Although the Readjusters were short of a majority after the election, they were able to assemble a governing coalition after a series of November demonstrations by leaders of the Richmond African-American community pressured 14 black, Republican legislators to join their caucus on December 13, 1879.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in power, the Readjuster party embarked upon an ambitious reform program.  This program included the repudiation of state debt, the abolition of the poll tax, extensive investments in public education that doubled the number of schools, teachers, and students, as well as the creation of Virginia State University to serve African-American students.  On December 12, 1879 the Readjuster party nominated their charismatic leader William Mahone for the US Senate, effectively ensuring that he would replace Conservative Debt-Payer, R.E. Withers in 1881.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to its political successes, the Readjuster Party also made a mark on Southern history by being the most successful bi-racial party in the South between the end of reconstruction and the Populist revolt of the 1890's.  In addition to the 14 black Republicans in the Readjuster caucus, the party also elected 12 black delegates under the Readjuster party label.  On December 3, 1879 the The Dispatch of Richmond paraphrased Readjuster state Senator, John Paul as saying, This is the first party organized in Virginia since the war which has broken color line.' Although the Readjusters would ultimately be defeated by the race-baiting tactics of conservative Democrats in subsequent elections they nonetheless made an indelible mark on Southern history and presaged the success of populist parties during the political upheavals of the 1890's"],"display_date":"November 4, 1879","search_date":"1879-11-04","locations":[{"id":13918,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1100,"title":"Louisiana State Constitutional Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-02-08","end_date":"1898-02-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In February and May of 1898, the Louisiana state government held a constitutional convention.

The results of the November 4, 1879 were that the Democrats were once again able to assert political dominance over the state through voter fraud and intimidation.  Moreover, the 12,000 vote total registered for the Greenback Party in the 1878 elections declined sharply as voter suppression targeted the Greenback's racially mixed coalition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pattern of fraud and intimidation in Greenback leaning counties mirrors the sharp reversal of alluvial, predominantly black counties from Republican to Democratic in 1875.  Just as the Yazoo and Kemper counties went from being heavily Republican counties in 1873 to casting a combined total of 11 votes for the Republicans in 1875 (see Skates) , so too were some of the most heavily Greenback counties heavily suppressed in 1879.  One example of this was shown when the November 6th issue of The Daily Constitution of Atlanta, reported with an astonished tone, Marshall County, which was considered the stronghold of greenbackism elects a full democratic ticket by a large majority.' This pattern of suppression of the Greenback vote would be repeated the next year in the Alabama gubernatorial election of 1880.  In this election voter fraud caused the number of ballots officially cast in the election to increase by the impossibly large difference of 177,254 in 1880 over 89,571 in the high-turnout elections of the year before.  This fraud allowed the Democratic candidate Rufus Cobb to beat Greenback candidate James Pickens by a margin of 134,911 to 42,343.  In the words of Greenback Party leader James Weaver, In the black belt country the Democrats will wait to see how large a majority they have to overcome, and will overcome it by their method of counting,' (see Lause).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Mississippi election of 1879 was but one instance of suppression of the Greenback vote and the black vote in the Deep South, it signaled profound changes for the state of Mississippi itself.

Notable measures passed under the constitution include Article 150 which transferred the state capital from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, Article 224 which mandated the creation of a free public school system, and Article 188 which stated that no restraints could be made on suffrage based on, race, color, or previous condition.' Although these measures appeared to signal a return to the legacy of reconstruction, in reality their progressive spirit was killed by the reactionary articles passed elsewhere under the constitution and the de facto  racist, patriarchal, and plutocratic realities of 1879 Louisiana. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most significant of these laws is the 1 poll tax passed under article 208.  Although the purpose of this measure was ostensibly to fund state education, its true purpose is clearly to disenfranchise poor voters, and particularly poor black voters, who could pose a threat to Bourbon control at the ballot box.  Another measure designed to maintain Bourbon control over the state apparatus was the continuation of the charter for the state lottery under Article 167.  Although this article seems innocuous, because Bourbon politicians pilfered most of the lottery returns to grease their political machine in reality it was a crucial element toward maintaining Bourbon control over the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the content of the constitution entrenched the existing hierarchies of the state, some of the most pernicious discriminatory aspects of Louisiana law after the ratification of the constitution of 1879 were legal precedents which the new constitution carried over with its ratification.  For example, the Louisiana Magistrate and Parish Officer's Guide, published in 1883 reflected the full spectrum of Louisiana's patriarchal laws.  For example the guide instructs officials that a woman cannot sue without her husband's permission, or bear witness to a will.  Perhaps the most subtly patriarchal of all the instructions provided to officials, is that a woman cannot re-marry until she has been separated from her husband for at least 10 months (almost certainly so as to ensure the new husband will not have his sexual dominion over his wife challenged by a pregnancy from her previous husband).  Another discriminatory aspect of the 1879 constitution comes through the extremely homophobic instructions that criminals who are convicted of attempted rape are to receive no more than two years in prison, while any person convicted of sodomy is sentenced to a life term of hard labor."],"display_date":"December 8, 1879","search_date":"1879-12-08","locations":[{"id":5600,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1161,"title":"End of the Cherokee Trail of Tears\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-05-16","end_date":"1839-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Trail of Tears was named as such by the Cherokee Indians who survived the forced march west from their native lands throughout Georgia and North Carolina.

The first, and most harmless according to Clay, was the class opposed to slavery by sentiment or philanthropy.  This class, he asserted, disliked the institution but would not upset the union or their own lives for the cause of abolition.  The second class he named the abolitionists.  This group he felt believed that the right of petition had been violated by congress and were more adamant to their cause, yet no more wanted to cause disunion to the nation.  The third and most dangerous class was the ultra-abolitionists.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay said, with them [ultra-abolitionists] the rights of property are nothing, the deficiency of the powers of the General Government is nothing; the acknowledgment and incontestable powers of the States are nothing; civil war, a dissolution of the Union, and the overthrow of a Government in which are concentrated the fondest hopes of the civilized world, are nothing.'&lt;br /&gt;Also in his speech, Clay addresses a concern on British emancipation of the West Indies.

In some cases, US explorers tried to live alongside Native-Americans who called the West their home, but hostility from both peoples often caused conflict.  Americans embraced the mindset that not only was it acceptable, but it was even their duty to organize and civilize the Indian tribes, whom they viewed as not, in fact, an independent people, nor ought they to be so considered' (Calhoun).  On January 15, 1820, Secretary of War J. C. Calhoun wrote to Speaker of the House Clay of the progress' that had been made thus far in this endeavor.  &lt;br /&gt;The widely held view of the Indians as savages' was distorted by embellished tales about their violent acts, such as an account of murders in The Clarion and Tennessee Gazette.  In this specific article, the editor actually points out the exaggerated, incorrect information previously reported regarding members of the Seminole tribe who killed and injured some Tennessee men.  The updated account corrects the previously barbarous portrayal of the Indians, but nevertheless these facts, describing how a jailor shot the Indian through the body;loaded his pistol a second time and shot him through the head,' coincide with the harsh attitude of Americans toward the Indian tribes.    &lt;br /&gt;In theory, the migration of Native-Americans west of the Mississippi River was voluntary, but leaders of tribes were usually pressured or forced into signing treaties with the United States government.  Popular thought was that it was, in Calhoun's words, impossible, with their [Native-Americans'] customs, that they should exist as independent communities in the midst of civilized society;and our opinion, not theirs, ought to prevail;in measures intended for their civilization and happiness.'  Congress made appropriations of ten thousand dollars annually to aid in advancing Indian societies in the US.  An additional emphasis of the efforts to conform the Native-Americans was establishing schools, and Calhoun mentioned the Cherokee as a relatively civilized people because they had already launched two successful schools.  Congress' message was that the Indian tribes must be brought gradually under our authority and laws, or they will insensibly waste away in vice and misery (Calhoun);' due to Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal policy of the 1830s, virtually all were controlled by the Americans, and eventually more than 100,000 Native-Americans migrated to the West."],"display_date":"January 15, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-15","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1179,"title":"John Brown and his fellow insurgents are captured\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-10-17","end_date":"1859-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Brown had started a raid against Harper's Ferry, Virginia (currently West Virginia) on October 16, 1859.

Many Americans believed that only through the use of military power could peace with Indians be secured.  Fortunately, in the end these efforts of peace talks proved fruitful, and the Americans did not have to resort to violence.  Very gradually, most warring Indian nations came to an agreement of keeping peace between the tribes and the settlers, even though they did not settle the issue of land cessions or money.

More specifically, his wife committed adultery with a black man, and gave birth to a mulatto child.  The General Assembly set the grounds for the divorce, requiring that the courts determine whether or not Hezekiah had been a faithful husband, as well as whether Betsy had really committed adultery.  This is an example of someone's marriage situation, while also showing that divorce did not seem uncommon if there was a sufficient reason, such as an unfaithful spouse.  &lt;br /&gt;Another example occurred in January of 1815, where a white married woman named Mary Godsey eloped with William Arthur, another white man.  Mary Godsey had been married for ten years to Robert Wright, a free mulatto who had inherited a large plantation from his father.  As a result of the elopement, Robert Wright submitted a petition for divorce.  This was a unique situation in two ways.  First of all, with Robert Wright and Mary Godsey's marriage, the couple violated Virginia's law that forbids interracial marriage.  However, there was no evidence that anyone in the community objected to the marriage, thus signifying that miscegenation was supported in the community.  Secondly, with Robert's divorce petition, he had the support of respectable farmers and slaveholders.  This shows that free blacks did not hesitate to use the courts, and also that one's class status was directly related to one's wealth in land and slaves instead of based solely on race.

The United States hoped to expand white settlement specifically in Mississippi, the Choctaw homeland.  In return for the Choctaw land, President Monroe agreed to a cession of about one-fifth of the state of Arkansas, encompassing sixteen counties.  In addition to ceding Southwestern Arkansas, the US gave up the southern half of Oklahoma, parts of the Texan panhandle,' and into New Mexico.  Jackson and Hinds made provisions to supply the Choctaw with blankets, kettles, and enough ammunition for a year in order to help the resettlement.  &lt;br /&gt;In an October 7 Arkansas Gazette article, before the treaty was written, the author clearly portrayed an attitude of white superiority over the Indians.  The author painted the picture that the whites were doing the Choctaw a favor, by being willing to let the owners of the country sell what they please.'  It is certainly not clear from this biased account that the Choctaw, as were most other Indian tribes, were actually pressured into the deal and felt as if they had little alternative.  On December 9, another Gazette report , written during the Treaty's proceedings , gave the most current information it had.  Without guaranteeing its accuracy, it presented the rumor that the treaty lately concluded with the Choctaws is very unpopular with that nation, and that they have openly shown their disapprobation by cutting off the head of their principal Chief, who had been instrumental in making the treaty.'&lt;br /&gt;Although the treaty attempted to improve and maintain friendly relations between the Native-Americans and the United States, which so happily subsists between them,' and simultaneously aid expansion, Arkansans were furious with the decision.  They were unwilling to lose a large portion of their valuable land, and many people vowed to move to Spanish Texas if the treaty was passed.  However, the US government believed they were doing a great service to the Choctaws by promising in article 5 of the Treaty to set up a fund to support the establishment of Indian schools, to be placed in the hands of the President of the United States, and to be applied by him expressly and exclusively to this valuable object.'

The ritual act of lynching was used by white Southerners to literally destroy the humanity of the black victim, but also to symbolically destroy that of every member of the race.  White Southerners terrorized African-Americans into submission by publicly killing a black person who violated some arbitrary behavior.  White Southerners couldn't stand the idea of a black person injuring a white person and getting away with the crime. Whites feared if the crime went unpunished it would encourage blacks to rise up against isolated whites on plantations.  White Southerners used lynchings to compensate for what they perceived as weak governments.  Lynchings occurred at higher rates in counties that had limited law enforcement, limited communication with the outside world, and a transient population.  Since many black people were forced to migrate to where there was work, it created a volatile situation.   &lt;br /&gt;The Chicago Daily Tribune reported there were 95 confirmed lynchings of African-Americans during 1889, of which 92 occurred in the South.

In the South homicide among blacks and whites was the highest compared to the rest of the nation and world. Within the turbulent south during the 1880s and early 1890s, politics and economic turmoil' constantly threw both blacks and whites into conflict. Most violence was caused by whites going against the blacks, especially since it was they who believed that it was the blacks who were dangerous and the blacks who bred the violence that hung over the South.' Blacks, however, at times did turn against the whites, and when they did so, they risked serious punishment by the whites. As Ayers explains that because the white men believed a legal execution was too good for such criminals,' these blacks were often dragged from jail to be tortured, hanged, and burned by these mobs of white men. This very situation occurred in Eastman, Georgia on August 6, 1882. &lt;br /&gt;An argument between two black men started a riot when thousands of blacks gathered for a camp meeting. The Montgomery Advertiser simply explained that a white police man attempted to restrain the aggressor, but the aggressor knocked down the policeman. A white deputy marshal shot this aggressor, called a fleeing prisoner,' which infuriated the mob. On August 12, the Atlanta Constitution states that the marshal and deputy marshal of Eastman arrested Jake Johnson on the charge of stealing a watch, and he shot and killed him as he tried to run away.  &lt;br /&gt;As a result, the angry mob murdered Mr. James Q. Harvard whose identity was mistaken for the deputy. The Atlanta Constitution describes that young Harvard was shot through the face and in the arm, and then he was dragged into the street and his head beaten into a pulp with heavy scantlings in the hands of the brutes.'  This article also claimed that the black people called for setting fire to the white houses and killing local whites. Eventually the police was able to subdue and arrest the crowd. At the end of the riot, one white man, Harvard, and four black men were killed. &lt;br /&gt;Further, Ayers also stated that local black leaders, for their own purposes, often joined with the whites in blaming vagrant blacks for any crime in the neighborhood.' &lt;br /&gt;The colored citizens of Eastman held a meeting after the outbreak to adopt resolutions unanimously' as explained in the article The Riot at Eastman.' There were two resolutions. The first stated that they, as Christians and law abiding citizens,' condemned the actions of the mob. The second stated that they were sympathetic to the unfortunate families of the deceased. The article further explained that the Eastman County is overrun by a turbulent negro population' from Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These people are supposedly brought out to Georgia to work on  the turpentine plantations below Eastman, and these people were the lawless, turbulent, and dangerous' rioters. &lt;br /&gt;The Atlanta Constitution in the Eastman Riot' article claimed that the authorities of Eastman and Doge County were doing all in their power to bring the perpetrators of this foul murder to justice.' A few months later, twenty-five people were convicted in court.

Although he was arrested and sometimes convicted on charges such as drinking and gambling, adultery, and theft, he became a leader of Choctaw County's blacks. He was also a somewhat successful organizer for the local Republicans and he played a key role in bringing the Republicans and the Greenbacks together. Not only were the whites persuaded that black crime was out of control, but as found in the Promise of the New South, whites were terrified of the rumors stating that black criminals were held up as heroes by the black community, championed for their bravery against persistent white.' Turner epitomized this situation, for he himself was a man of political influence, a leader of the black community, and he planed a conspiracy against the whites. &lt;br /&gt;On August 15, some papers were found supposedly revealing Turner as the leader of a widespread black conspiracy to murder all the whites in Choctaw County.

Mr. Allen was the children's legal guardian under Mississippi's apprentice law of November 22, 1865.  This law operated under the illusion that it was protecting young black orphans and potential delinquents.  It said that young black people, orphaned or not, may be bound into an apprenticeship.  The former owner of any young black person was given the first opportunity to claim them as an apprentice, thus legally binding them to the plantation and its owner.  When Ms. Taylor appealed to a local Freedman's Bureau agent about her situation, there was little that the organization could do.  After removing her children from Mr. Allen's plantation Taylor was brought to court where a judge told her that she must leave her children.  The Mississippi apprentice law that plagued Ms. Taylor may have been conceived at an 1865 Mississippi convention, as a bill proposed to the state legislature.  Bill No. 6 was published for the readers of the <em>Hinds County Gazette</em> to consider.  The text of this proposed legislation directly discussed the apprentice system, and the ways in which a young black person could be legally bound to a plantation owner or other sort of employer.

The prominent differences between the two were that the Confederate Constitution sought different guarantees of states' rights and protected slavery as an institution.   Members of the convention held in Montgomery made it their goal to create a constitution for the southern states to unite under.  After review, the members submitted the constitution to the convention of delegates, ratified, and ultimately passed it under the provisional government. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;          Key changes appeared in the Confederate Constitution.  In lieu of more perfect union', they substituted, a permanent federal government.'  The Confederacy declared in their constitution that no law could deny, the right of property in negro slaves'.  In essence, Congress and the territorial government now recognized and protected slavery.  (Jewett, p. 2)  Southern states felt that the North exploited them economically and that radical changes needed to occur in order to protect their profits and freedoms.  Although it protected domestic slavery, the Confederate Constitution prohibited the importation of slaves from any foreign countries that were not territories of the United States.  The delegates also decided to make themselves into the Electoral College for future elections in the government.  &lt;br /&gt;          &lt;br /&gt;          President Davis later made a speech announcing the permanent ratification of the Constitution after its ratification by the Confederate States.

While in North Caroline, Chesnutt studied the culture, dialect, and superstitions of southern blacks.  In 1883 he returned to Cleveland where he wrote various stories based on black folk culture which were published in various magazines.  The Goophered Grapevine was the first of such stories and was published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1887.  The Conjure Woman was a collection of stories published by Houghton, Mifflin in 1899.

The flagrant racism found throughout the south explains why the majority of murders were committed by white men against black victims.  However, many killings of blacks remained unreported as they often went unpunished.   All murder cases in which the victim was white were reported and the black murderer was more often than not put to death.  In 1885 a publisher  estimated over two hundred and twenty three murders occurred each year in Kentucky.  Violence towards blacks in the south was commonplace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence continued in Kentucky following the post-war periods.  Formal organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan initiated acts of violence in the years following the Civil War.  However, by 1890 Kentucky had become increasingly lawless and lesser organizations connected to the Ku Klux Klan carried out frequent acts of violence throughout Kentucky.  These groups were known as Regulators'.  They committed lawless acts under the justification that they were in fact doing their part for the preservation of justice in the white south.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, 1899 a civilian mob attacked the jail and demanded prisoner Richard Coleman.

Her body was found on October 5, 1899 in a cabin on her husband's farm six miles outside of Mayesville.  On October 6, 1899 hundreds of people called for the hanging of Coleman and unsuccessfully attacked the jail at 2:00 a.m.  The following day, Mrs. Lashbrook's funeral was held and Coleman was sent to Covington for safety reasons.  Once the mob seized Richard Coleman, they burned him alive in front of hundreds of onlookers and publicly mutilated his corpse.  The African American Richard Coleman was an accused murderer.

In 1897 Ware High School was thriving, nearly doubling its number of students and even added an assistant teacher since its establishment.  Its principal, Henry L.

It appears that initial spark for this movement came from Lucy Laney, the principal of a competing African American private school, although evidence is fragmentary.  &lt;br /&gt;This decision and due to the nature of its sudden announcement, serious debate was sparked among the African-American community and led to a storm of protest backed by a 155 person petition for the reopening of the high school addressed to the school board, and split the community.

It is important to note that all three of the dissenters represented the Fifth Ward, a lower-class factory region which was the cities strongest Populist ward.  While they had initially spoke of compromise, the board simply offered to restore Ware when economic conditions permitted' (Kousser 28).&lt;br /&gt;In Superior Court, Judge Enoch Calloway decided that the board had discretion to abolish all the high schools or tailor them to fit the needs of students of different races and geographical areas' and that once the board did decide to open public high school facilities for whites, it had to offer them for blacks as well' (Kousser 31).  However, in Georgia Supreme court this ruling was overruled and granted the board entirely unlimited discretion over high schools' (Kousser 32) &lt;br /&gt; The case eventually found his way into the United States Supreme Court, which focused on the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment in the United States Constitution.

The Supreme Court decided in favor of the school board, permitting the separate treatment of African-Americans with respect to their education, setting a poor precedent that gave the southern and other states a green light to heighten discrimination in publicly funded activities and discouraged black litigants from seeking redress in federal courts' (Kousser 43).

Conductor Rivers endeavoured to explain the rules of the company and that he had the right to forcibly remove them, yet the men did not move. Rivers called the police, but they also failed to remove the men.

The Trail, which was an overland trade route between St. Louis, Missouri, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, was critical to the growing economy of Missouri. It had resulted in a tremendous amount of trade through the mid-West, and had also spurred new industries such as wagon construction in Missouri. Indian attacks on caravans posed a major threat to the route, however, and threatened to disrupt it entirely. Senator Benton's bill therefore sought to secure federal protection for the area and had important implications in the development of US Western and Indian policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bill shows, as well, overarching national sentiments on Indians and the problems of state governments trying to assert their sovereignty over Indian territories. In The Globe, for example, a December 14, 1830, section entitled Missouri Politics includes an address by Missouri Governor Miller in which he states that the citizens of Missouri have already been greatly harassed by the depredations of Indians,' yet that the ground (the Indians) occupy is not attached to any county, and hence State officers cannot act in relation to the offences committed upon it.' The Governor goes on to declare the situation manifestly inconsistent with the sovereignty and policy of the State' and to call for the Federal government to ensure state sovereignty within their borders, including Indian territories within existing states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation in Missouri, in addition to representing a large threat to local stability and to the local economy, also represents a much larger movement in the United States of states demanding the right to sovereignty within their recognized borders. Eventually, this results in the Indian Removal Act enacted on May 28, 1830, which allows for the relocation of Indian tribes to unorganized territory west of the Mississippi River, and which inherently recognizes states' rights within their borders."],"display_date":"March 13, 1830","search_date":"1830-03-13","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1461,"title":"Murder of Milton Seaton\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-11-25","end_date":"1899-11-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The prevalence of homicide in the south increased greatly in the second half of the nineteenth century.

The Baton Rouge Gazette reports on January 30, 1830, that on Saturday night last about 10 o'clock Mr. John Whitten was killed by one of his own slaves, by a discharge from a musket loaded with buckshot.' Events such as this, an actual murder by a slave were extremely rare in the slave South, and when they did occur were a shock to the community and caused a great deal of anxiety and often conspiracy theories about slave uprisings -- such as fear of events like what became known as Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. As to Gazette writes when we see such outrages committed by negroes of the country, what have we not to fear from the strange negroes who are introduced every day into the State of Louisiana?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far more likely than the outright murder of his or her master was that a slave would simply run away, whether it be in an attempt to get to the North or just to a secluded local area. Southern newspapers, then, are littered with advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves as well as notices of captured runaways and where they are being held. The Richmond Enquirer, for example, lists on April 16, 1830, on a single page three different rewards for runaways and three notices of a captured slave being held in the local jail. The Raleigh Regsiter, on March 25, 1830, includes an ad entitled Notice. Twenty Dollar Reward. Ran away from the subscriber on the 10th of February.' Interestingly, here the ad describes the runaway as a white slave,' referring to his skin tone, perhaps meaning he had a white parent or grandparent. All of these ads, however, list a brief description of the runaway as well as the name given by his or her master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, sometimes the unthinkable did occur and a slave struck back. The aftermath, however, is important because it is designed to establish a sense of justice in the eyes of white slave owners, and to reassure them about the continuity of a stable slave society. Zac, for example, the slave convicted of murdering John Whitten, was described as his master's favorite,' and he confessed that he alone was guilty.' Thus, to white society this was a single act by what was likely a deranged individual. After all, why would a slave who was his master's favorite' have any reason to kill that master?"],"display_date":"January 30, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-30","locations":[{"id":5501,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1466,"title":"Lynchings in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-07-05","end_date":"1892-07-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Smith Tooley and John L.

The Postmaster General of Augusta said that he would dare not inflict on any community a colored postmaster, provided it has never been done before.'&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this event revolves around racial tensions within a particular community, notably that many whites were extremely uncomfortable with African-Americans holding any type of authoritative or leading positions in societies.

By these rules, a contract for the labor in question had to be produced in writing and given to an agent of the Bureau. It was also stated that, The employer will stipulate to provide good and sufficient food, quarters, and medical attendance for the entire family...' The contract made between Bath and Littlepage deviated quite significantly from these regulations. In their agreement, Littlepage agreed to farm part of Bath's land in shares in return for one half the cotton and one third of the corn raised. In the contract, Littlepage was required to supply his own mule, do all of the woodwork on the plows and pay for one half of the cotton, potato and pea seeds.

Four black members of the Louisiana state legislature occupied the lower berths.

He stated that he believed that no other place existed outside the South of people more hardworking and more loyal to the United States.  In addition, referring to southern laws regarding African-Americans, he acknowledged that some (especially in the North) question the South, its history and its dealing with race relations.  Patterson added that the South's reforms (segregation laws) fail to make southerners disloyal and treasonous.  He wrote we have not the remotest idea of being guilty of treason and I do not doubt but that when the negroes rise upon us with brutal and savage ferocity that the people of the North will come to our reforms.'"],"display_date":"January 11, 1890","search_date":"1890-01-11","locations":[{"id":752,"lat":34.7798418653,"lng":-92.3166533878,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1550,"title":"Governor Nominating Conventions in Tennessee Spark Exchange between State Democrats and Republicans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-03","end_date":"1890-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the time leading up to both the Democratic and Republican nominating conventions for state governor, each party attempted to sort out its ideal choice for candidate.

The focus remained on business rather than political matters.  However, eastern Tennesseans still plan to attend the Democratic convention with open minds about all the candidates.

Therefore Republicans place little importance in whoever receives their nomination.  In the late 1800s, Republican support in the South remained largely African American.  White politicians designed measures such as the poll-tax and registration restrictions to disenfranchise African-Americans and hence weakening the Republican vote.

After the peace at Appomattox Courthouse, each state formerly in rebellion needed to create a new Constitution that conformed to the requirements set out by the President. A.J.

McElwee and other black delegates, cognizant that they could not win the nomination, were nonetheless hopeful that civil rights would be on the agenda. At first, James Blaine, the nominee from 1884, and General Philip Sheridan appeared to be the leading contenders. However, Blaine's corrupt past , an issue that likely cost him the previous election , still worried the Party. The delegates also quickly ruled out Sheridan as a possibility, primarily because of his failing health (he would die two months later).

South Carolina led the way , in the upcoming election of 1888, many candidates promised their constituency that they would introduce voting reform' that sought to ultimately disenfranchise blacks. Floridians followed suit when, in the same year, representatives from the Florida legislature presented a bill proposing a tax upon all voters. Though the legislature did not unanimously support the bill, they finally passed and fully enacted it a year later. It effectively made Florida the first Southern state to institute a poll tax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of this law were almost immediate. In the 1888 Presidential Election, a record 62% of black males and 75% of total eligible males voted. Only four years later, the figures had dropped to 11% and 39%, respectively. These statistics also illustrate an interesting side note: poll taxes and literary tests curbed both poor blacks and whites from voting. Most importantly, the Florida poll tax put a complete end to the gains of Florida's blacks during Reconstruction. At the peak of Radical Reconstruction in 1870, for example, Josiah Walls became the first black Congressman from Florida.

For blacks, the system perpetuated a form of economic slavery. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the late 1880's, the Farmers Alliance formed. A group of organizations aimed at improving agricultural conditions in the South, it gained steady momentum in the early 1880's by calling for the end of the crop-lien system.

Still, Fisk appealed to many Americans for his fundamentally religious message, which implored the prohibition of alcohol for the moral betterment of the nation. He received approximately 3% of the total vote. In such a close election, Fisk's constituency may have had a considerable influence on the outcome, especially given the fact that Cleveland garnered more popular votes than the victor, Benjamin Harrison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fisk died two years later, on July 9, 1890.

The First Treaty of Indian Springs marks Georgia's first of many governmental and territorial struggles with its Native American population.  The provisions of the treaty gave the U.S. government land lying between the head of the Flint and Chatahooche Rivers, and gave the Creek Nation a small reserve of land that lay within the boundaries of the state.  Despite the acquiring of newly ceded land, Georgia legislature demanded the removal of the Creek Nation, citing the 1802 promise on behalf of the United States government to remove the Indians from within the limits of the state of Georgia. &lt;br /&gt;Both the Creek and Cherokee were partially settled on permanent farms within state limits while enjoying the rule of sovereign tribal governments that owed no allegiance to Georgia, provisions which were given to the Creeks and Cherokees under the of the First Treaty of Indian Springs. Georgia Legislature took the task upon themselves, and actively pursued the removal of both nations from within state limits.  In early 1825, a small number of Creek chiefs who lacked the authority or consent of the Creek Confederacy signed the Second Treaty of Indian Springs.  According to the provisions of the treaty, lands belonging to the entire Confederacy were purportedly ceded to the United States; however, the treaty proved to be an act of defiance against the wishes of the national government.  Despite not having the treaty examined by federal officials, Georgia authorities began surveying the lands.  Anticipating conflict with the national government, Governor Troup called upon the legislature to stand to your arms, and wrote in a letter addressed to the Secretary of War ;in a sober report to the legislature it was urged that the time was rapidly approaching when the Slave States must confederate.'&lt;br /&gt;Orders from Washington suspended the survey, but in November of 1825, when addressing his state legislature Governor Troup asserted between States equally independent it is not required of the weaker to yield to the stronger. Between sovereigns the weaker is equally qualified to pass upon its rights.  A new treaty was negotiated, but Troup and the federal government remained at odds during the subsequent two years, culminating in Governor Troup eventually calling out his state militia in defense of land he believed to be rightfully Georgia's.   By 1827, the Creek were gone. The Cherokees, more highly civilized and better organized than the Creeks, managed to avoid any treaty for surrendering their lands, and thus Georgia asserted its jurisdiction over them without adherence to the solemn treaties of the United States during the years to follow.

Liberally interpreting his ambiguous instructions, Jackson led his troops deep into areas of Florida under Spanish control, capturing two Spanish forts. Because Florida held the potential of becoming a new slave state, southern congressmen eagerly backed Jackson's plans.  In addition to securing greater protection for American settlements, the mission helped to expose the vulnerability of Spanish rule in Florida. Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, used that vulnerability to pressure Spain into selling Florida to the United States, and after ratification of the Adams-Onis treaty outlining the conditions of the purchase and drawing territorial boundaries for the remaining Spanish holdings in North America, the U.S. government purchased Florida in February of 1821 for five million U.S. dollars, all of which was paid directly to U.S. citizens with claims against the Spanish government.  General Jackson was appointed Military Governor of the Territory in March, and resigned in December of the same year. Florida was not signed into statehood until March 3, 1845 during the Presidential term of John Tyler. ","During the later years of the eighteenth century and start of the nineteenth century, Spanish Florida saw an onslaught of immigration from U.S. states due to attractive land grants and because it was seen as a safe haven for escaped slaves seeking refuge from U.S. laws binding them to harsh masters and conditions in the southern plantation states.  Though runaway slaves viewed Florida as a place to find freedom, slave traders considered Florida an ideal place of business.  Although in 1808 the U.S. passed laws prohibiting the importation of African slaves, because Florida was still under Spanish rule and in combination with its abundance of coastline, slave traders brought African slaves into Florida and then smuggled them into Georgia to be sold to plantation owners.  The Florida slave trade continued even after the United States took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1821.  Plantation owners began to immigrate to Florida, bringing their slaves with them, and the population of Florida more that quadrupled between the years of 1830 and 1860.

He wanted niggers. In particular, he wanted the ability to hire an overseer, to raise himself to a higher class distinction. Some of his hunting buddies had overseers, and their constant dialogue about plantation life left Keen on the outside. He wanted nothing more in life than a plantation of niggers so I could talk about my overseer. Keen decided he would marry a rich, old widow to fulfill his slaveholding aspirations.","His first matrimonial expedition failed miserably. He found no rich widows waiting for him, and, in fact, he actually fell in love with one of the prettiest girls I ever saw in my life. Her name was Martha Hooker, but she was 16 and poor; she offered no hope of a suitable dowry to hire an overseer off of. Love was just a mere distraction to Keen. Over the next few weeks he began to write to a widow who filled the bill, but only received silence in return. Frustrated, he obtained a letter of introduction and set out to call upon the old lady. Her name was Rhoda Dean, and her youngest of nine children was 26. Keen was only 22. On his first visit, Keen got straight to the point, for he was never favorably impressed with long courtships; would she marry him? The answer took a few minutes but she consented. Numbers raced through Keen's head, for Rhoda Dean's estate was valued at seventy five thousand dollars. He could finally hire the overseer of his dreams and more slaves to accompany him. As Historian Walter Johnson might say, George Keen was constructing himself out of slaves, literally. Keen saw his value as a man in the amount of slaves he owned and if that amount qualified him to hire an overseer. He was affectionately called a Florida cracker, a plain folk white with little or no slaves. For Keen and other pioneers, he viewed his station as temporary. Non-slaveholding status preceded slaveholding without an overseer which preceded planter status. Each step Keen took in Columbia County brought him closer to the pinnacle, to manhood, and to conversing with his hunting buddies about their overseers.","Slaves were southern symbols of masculinity and whiteness, but they were also literal commodities and property. The ownership of property lay at the foundation of southern society and stood as a barrier to participation within that network. Political involvement, economic leverage, and social interaction hinged upon the amount of property possessed, and Keen knew this very well. He saw numbers everywhere. The widow was worth 75,000 dollars, and Keen himself was worth 4,000 dollars in niggers, land, cattle, horses, and money. Free blacks on Virginia's Eastern Shore in the seventeenth century were able to interact with patrons and have legal standing before the court because they leased, then owned, land tracts and raised cattle. As the South moved westward and into Florida, the frontier communities that developed were full of men like George Keen, ambitious, industrious men seeking opportunity in a society still forming. To progress upward in the hierarchy, Keen was willing to do anything, even marry a widow three times his age."],"display_date":1847,"search_date":"1847-07-02","locations":[{"id":1311,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"COLUMBIA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1982,"title":"Dirty Elections\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-23","end_date":"1890-01-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 23, 1890, a small county newspaper printed in Lexington, Virginia published an article discussing the corruption of the election process with the memory of the prior year's November election fresh in the mind. The writer of the article was disgusted with the corruption of the election process, and was fed up with the continuing corruption. The congressional seats of important mining areas are described like commodities sold to the highest bidder. The paper describes the people as disenfranchised by the power of mineral kings, and that they had no more voice in the Senate than the people of England do in their House of Lords. The paper called for direct Senatorial election to eradicate the corruption that had so plagued the election process; it petitioned for the seventeenth amendment more than twenty years before it was passed by Congress."," The Democratic Party had a stranglehold on the South since the end of the Civil War. They used a variety of corrupt techniques to ensure their power in the South; bribery, ballot box stuffing, and even murder were common tactics used by the Democratic Party to push its agenda throughout the South. These problems were even stronger in Virginia, due to the high level of importance that the state held to the Democratic Party as a strongly populated and strongly influential state in the South. In fact, election fraud became such a problem that Virginia elections were challenged no less than sixteen times between the years of 1874 and 1900. The Democratic Party even appealed to the Southern white man's fear of the newly freed, enfranchised black American by calling Republican rule Negro rule. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, however, voters were becoming more and more disillusioned by the political process, and by the 1890's, the Democratic Party, so confident in the Solid South faced huge problems of voter apathy. Voter participation was around 40 percent in some areas as the South toward the end of the nineteenth century and in some years it even fell below that. People began to realize that they were almost absolutely disenfranchised from the political process because of the corruption that ran so rampant, and they began to ignore elections.

Brown of Tennessee spoke at a benefit for an orphan's asylum in Nashville, Tennessee. During his speech at Odd Fellow's Hall, he addressed the recent progress of the United States in regarding the escalating question of slavery. Governor Brown expressed the feelings of many southerners who felt threatened by the anti-slavery rhetoric in the North. The Governor also vividly exposed the hypocrisy of northerners in their efforts to end slavery, yet contain the African American population to the South. ","Governor Brown first questioned the constitutionality of northern sentiment to alter the institution of slavery. He specifically referred to the three-fifths clause in the Constitution that compared a slave's status to that of the white man. Brown asked if the Connecticut of today was unwilling to stand to the compact ratified by the Connecticut of 1787? In the eyes of Governor Brown any breakdown or change within the Constitution would lead to the breakdown of the Union. The South wished to stand by the compact made in 1787, while the North, whether directly or indirectly, wanted to break it. The Governor realized how much northern communities feared the infiltration of African Americans. Throughout the South, African Americans lacked equality to whites and lived under brutal oppression. But African Americans lived directly along side whites on a day to day basis. Slave women participated in raising their master's children, and some slave men acted as overseers and managed important aspects of the plantations on which they lived. Northerners did not live in close quarters with African Americans. They did not embrace them as part of their families as did many southerners. Governor Brown exemplified this point to his audience at Odd Fellow's Hall. He declared that once the North ensured African American's their escape from bondage, where shall they go? Who will receive them? Will the North? Never"," Governor Brown acknowledged, like many other southerners, that northerners did not feel a moral obligation to end slavery. Northerners sought to end slavery in order to better provide for themselves. According to Frederick Law Olmsted, northerners did not detest slavery, it is simply the negro competition and the monopoly of the opportunities to make money by negroe owners. Governor Brown and his fellow southerners knew that northerners wanted nothing to do with freed slaves and the competition for cheap labor they might create with a mass migration to the North. Poor, non-slaveholding whites in the South reaffirmed this fear for northerners. Frederick Law Olmstead suggests that poor white people were usually far better off in the free states, than in the slave. Northern interest in ending the spread of slavery correlated to their primary concern for ending the economical advancement of the elite South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":11953,"lat":36.1785835172,"lng":-86.867295434,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1997,"title":"The 50 Dollar Reward for Harry the Runaway\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-12-12","end_date":"1846-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 12, 1846, Landon Harrison ran a wanted advertisement in The Nashville <em>Daily Union</em>. Months later, on Saturday, March 27, 1847, the Daily Union continued to run the advertisement. One of the slaves on Harrison?s plantation ran away, and Harrison entered a wanted ad in hopes of having him found and returned as soon as possible. In order to ensure the slaves safe return, master's like Harrison made thorough descriptions of their slaves in want ads. Historian Michael Mullin points out that whites identified ethnicity in three ways, appearance, patterns of scarification, and by dialect. In his wanted advertisement, Harrison described Harry as a young negro boy of around 18 years of age. Harry stood about five foot three inches tall with a black complexion. When he left Harrison's plantation he wore a mixed jeans frock coat, and a green blanket coat, and a palm leaf hat. Harrison believed that the boy traveled to the towns in which he had the closest relations: Gallatin and Lebanon."," The first line of Harrison's wanted advertisement stated the reward for the runaway in bold print. Landon Harrison offered 50 dollars reward for the return of Harry. He requested that if anyone found Harry, they needed to return him directly to the Nashville jail. From there, Landon Harrison would determine the reward by whether or not the capturer found Harry within the borders of the state. If captured within state lines, the reward stood at 25 dollars. If captured across state lines, the reward doubled to 50 dollars. Landon Harrison's reward was indicative of a slave's monetary worth. The further away an escaped slave managed to travel the less likely he is to be caught. Thus the monetary reward should be greater if someone captured Harry outside of the state. The slave master feared unoccupied, unsupervised slaves because of the cost they incurred when slaves escaped. Slaveholders knew the loss of investment that accompanied the loss of a slave."," Runaways who were returned to their owners received harsh punishment for attempting to escape. Michael Mullin gives one account of a master who bound, gagged, and left his slave to insects for running off. Sometimes, however, masters sold their runaways once someone found and returned them. Some masters did not want their other slaves to believe that they too could escape and get away with it. So instead, the master acted as though he made the decision to sell the slave in the first place. Slaveholders through out the South struggled in this same sense to maintain their power and threatening force over their slaves, who increasingly sought to experience freedom."],"display_date":"December 12, 1846","search_date":"1846-12-12","locations":[{"id":11952,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1999,"title":"The Mixed Congregation of St. John&#39;s Church in Ashwood\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-01-01","end_date":"1841-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the fall of 1841, the townspeople of Ashwood erected St. John's Episcopal Church halfway between Columbia and Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee. A Philadelphian man gave an in depth account of the church?s first service in a letter he wrote to the editor of The Guardian. As a northerner, he acted as an outside observer in this small southern town. He elaborately described the architecture, location, congregation, and leaders of the newly built church. "," Reverend Bishop Polk built the church on a lot adjacent to his plantation in Ashwood. He and his three brothers chiefly financed the church's construction. The location of St. John's was ideal for both the Bishop and the Episcopal families that lived in the surrounding area. Although not many Episcopal families lived in Ashwood, the Bishop and other founders intended the church to serve as a place of worship for the slaves of these few families. On the day of the first service, the church welcomed these slaves into the congregation. The anonymous Philadelphian described at length the four and half hour services that transpired that day. Reverend Bishop Otey, Reverend Bishop Polk, Reverend Smith, and W.F. Leacock of Williamsport consecrated the church. Following the consecration, Reverend Otey presented candidates for baptism and Reverend Polk performed two confirmations. The proceedings of the service that day impressed the Philadelphian. Nothing could compare, however, to the sheer composition of the congregation. The number of slaves in attendance came as a shock to the Philadelphian. And a more happy group I have seldom seen, he enthusiastically observed. He recalled the Bishop's invitation for blacks to come forward at the same time as whites to receive communion. Ah, could some of our friends have witnessed that scene, how would it have silenced the suspicion that the slaveholder values not the soul of his slaves, the northerner exclaimed."," In the South, African Americans and their masters often shared in the church-going ritual. Historian Bobby Lovett confirms the importance of the church services and the socializing that took place afterwards. These services consumed a great portion of the day and thus it was most convenient for the owners to take the slaves belonging to the family to church with them rather than leave them unattended for extended periods of time. But unlike the scene in Ashwood, Tennessee, churches in other regions of Tennessee or the South often participated in greater discrimination. African Americans usually took communion last, they sat in the rear of the church in all black pews, and the church prohibited them from becoming officers within the church government.

Bibb, a Louisa County attorney, received a letter on May 5, 1888 from R. M. Barllock in Woodburn, Virginia asking Bibb to represent him in a law suit involving a former slave.  Barllock wanted to collect money from the estate of a man who had passed away several years ago.  In his letter to Bibb, Barllock explained that the suit was in favor of a former slave, Bob Carr, who was attempting to claim the legacy that he was entitled to according to his deceased master's will.  Barllock informed Bibb that he had consulted a judge on the matter who laughed and said that Bob had forfeited his freedom nor could a master leave a servant a legacy.  The court room was one of the venues in which racial tensions tinged interactions that transpired between blacks and whites in Central Virginia during the 1880s and 1890s. As individual whites from Central Virginia stumbled upon opportunities to influence the welfare of a black person whose life or liberty was in immediate danger, they made conscious, personal decisions which either reinforced discriminatory behavior or called the contemporary dynamics of racial relations into question.  ","William Bibb's dilemma was similar to the conundrum faced by Judith Randolph, who lived in Central Virginia nearly a century earlier.  According to Melvin Ely in<em> Israel on the Appomattox,</em> Judith Randolph had to decide whether to obey the instructions in her late husband's will that indicated his desire to free all of his slaves and provide them with parcels of land.  Despite the passage of nearly 100 years and the abolition of slavery, the question over the legitimacy of blacks' claims to money or property left to them by a deceased master remained a topic of debate in Central Virginia.  Bibb faced the decision of taking the case and arguing against a black man's rights to a legacy that was clearly left to him in a will or refusing to defend Barllock.  By refusing to represent Barllock, Bibb could either make a political statement of his support for blacks' legal rights or simply maintain a comfortable distance from the issue.","During this time, people from Bibb's region, Central Virginia, behaved towards blacks in contradictory ways.  In some instances Central Virginians were tolerant and respectful of blacks' rights.  In <em>Free Lance</em>, Fredericksburg's city paper, the author of an obituary for Pat Boxley dubbed him a leading and influential colored politician and drayman of Fredericksburg.   Yet, Central Virginians of the time made discriminatory distinctions between whites and blacks.  Not only was Boxley a politician, he was a colored politician.  In fact, every time a reporter mentioned a black person in Free Lance in the 1880s, the person's name was followed by the marker colored.    ","Like the man who wanted to deny Carr his legacy, whites across Virginia expressed their sense of dominion, and superiority in regards to black people in a variety of contexts, according to Edward Ayers in <em>The Promise of the New South</em>.  These racial tensions haunted blacks on a daily basis by providing unmistakable reminders of blacks' inferior social status and their minimal claims to the civil rights that were guaranteed to white Virginians.  Questions concerning the legitimacy of blacks' rights as well as efforts by whites to deny or remove these rights were evident in a variety of contexts besides the courtroom.  As Ayers illustrates, the 1880s and 1890s marked the beginning of major segregation efforts in most southern states, including Virginia.  Ayers explains that southerners exerted great effort to pass discriminatory laws that governed the daily interactions between blacks and whites in the 1880s.  The struggle in race relations in the 1880s and 1890s resulted from whites' feelings of superiority and mastery over, as Ayers asserts, those who intentionally or accidentally stepped over some invisible and shifting line of permissible behavior."],"display_date":"May 5, 1888","search_date":"1888-05-05","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2015,"title":"The Power of Scientific Racism in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-11-27","end_date":"1888-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Holladay, a farmer from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, felt relieved as he read Francis Ruffin's pamphlet entitled The Negro as a Political and Social Factor.  Holliday conveyed his gratitude in a letter to the author.  Holladay proclaimed, Your forcible presentation of facts, derived from a national experiment, and from extended intelligent and conscientious observation in different fields. . . is fitted to cement the union of those whose convictions of the unfitness of the negro, in capacity and character for the position to which he is hoisted, have rested mainly on circumscribed tho' it may be personal observation.  Francis Gildart Ruffin, a planter in Chesterfield County, Virginia, wrote several political papers based on scientific racism that were widely read and distributed.  Planters throughout Virginia and other southern states responded to Ruffin's writing with support and enthusiasm.  Scientific racism involved the use of observations or data to substantiate the claim that black people are socially, biologically, intellectually and culturally inferior to whites.  Proponents of scientific racism claimed that racial differences were a result of inherent genetic or biological qualities of the members of each race.  Central Virginians, like Holliday, placed importance on the use of systematic observations and facts to substantiate anecdotal evidence and validate their claims concerning the negro's inferiority.  Central Virginians who endorsed scientific racism at the end of the nineteenth century argued that the inferior attributes of negroes could not be overcome through social experiences.","Although Holladay directly articulated his support for scientific racism in his personal correspondence, other Central Virginians expressed scientific racism in more subtle ways.  In the Fredericksburg <em>Free Lance</em>, the reporter who wrote an article about an incompetent police officer, Policeman Brace, claimed, A little duck-legged colored girl out ran him so far in a chase that she was out of sight the first jump.  In order to make the policeman's lack of skill especially clear for the readership, the reporter chose the most extreme point of comparison, a young colored girl.  The concept of black biological inferiority was readily available in the minds of Central Virginians at the time.  Other newspaper articles attributed crimes committed by black men to their childlike mental deficits, such as one man's sweet tooth and another man's confidence in his good looks.  Central Virginians considered black perpetrators intellectually inferior, as their criminal intent stemmed from the mental defects of their race instead of a fully conscious, rational choice to commit crime.     ","According to George Fredrickson in <em>Racism</em>, scientific racism was a medium through which whites, like Holliday, from areas throughout the South justified denying black people full legal or social rights and status in the late nineteenth century.  Southerners thought that the northerners' support for black rights clearly contradicted southerners' arguments regarding the inability of blacks to successfully assume a higher position in the social and political order.  In the letter, Holladay expressed his anger as he claimed that northerners had abruptly placed [negroes] on a political equality with the intelligent and cultured white people who were recently their masters. Many southerners, such as Holliday, felt that northerners lacked the knowledge of the fallibility of the negro that southerners had developed through extensive experience with their slaves.  Yet, Fredrickson argues that northerners believed that African Americans were inferior, as well.  People from both the North and South had problems granting black people equal political and social rights in the late nineteenth century.

After discovering that Johnson had escaped, the staff of the asylum realized that they needed to act quickly.  An employee hurriedly wrote a note in order to inform the Sheriff of Louisa County of the incident before he had an opportunity to apprehend Johnson.  On February 16, 1881 the employee reported to the Sheriff, Mr. Johnson, a colored inmate from your county escaped from this asylum.  If he gives no trouble he will be allowed to remain at large. . .  The staff of the asylum did not want the Sheriff to return Mr. Johnson to the facility.  ","In Central Virginia during the late nineteenth century, judges and sheriffs decided the fate of those who the courts declared lunatics, such as Mr. Johnson. Judges customarily rendered decisions concerning a person's sanity.  On January 23, 1882 a court in Mr. Johnson's home county, Louisa, declared that William P. Anderson was a lunatic and ordered the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the lunatic asylum in Staunton, Virginia.  The judges noted in the next line of the court order that the Sheriff should instead take Mr. Anderson to the asylum in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Judges sent lunatics to one of the several nearby asylums in the state, such as the asylum in Richmond, Staunton, and Williamsburg.  Virginia asylums, such as the Central Lunatic Asylum where the Louisa judges sent Johnson, experienced problems with overcrowding in the 1880s and 1890s. Judges considered which facility could accommodate new patients when choosing where a lunatic should be sent.  ","During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an insanity judgment carried a different meaning for blacks, such as Mr. Johnson, and whites in Central Virginia.  Fredericksburg's paper,<em> Free Lance</em>, printed an article about a local colored man who was sent to the jail because the asylum in Virginia for colored lunatics was full at the time.  Thus, some asylums in Virginia were completely segregated.  Other facilities in Virginia took in both black and white patients.  Many asylums in the South segregated each ward by race, in order to prevent problems. The intermixing of black and white patients in asylums throughout Virginia and in other southern states led to racial tensions, which often escalated into verbal insults or physical assaults between inmates, according to Gerald Grob in <em>Mental Illness in American Society</em>.  Furthermore, Grob posits that white attendants often physically attacked black inmates who retaliated against their white aggressors.  To keep a colored inmate like Mr. Johnson outside of the facility would have helped to quell the racial tensions that spread throughout the asylums in Virginia and throughout the South at the time.","On account of the cruel treatment and violence against blacks that infiltrated the asylums of Virginia, Johnson had motivation to escape.  As Johnson escaped from the asylum, he also escaped the cruel and inhumane punishment reserved for lunatics in the asylums of the period. Confinement in an asylum in Virginia and throughout the South during this period was in many ways comparable to placement in the penitentiary.  The Fredericksburg judge decided to send the colored man to jail when the asylum was full, as a result of the similarities in the treatment received at asylums and prisons.  According to David Rothman, the wardens of the penitentiaries utilized brute force and cruel torture methods to impose order and command deference to authority.  The staff of the asylums also frequently utilized physical force or restraint devices on the inmates.  Superintendents of insane asylums developed procedures for the asylums that instilled a militaristic sense of order, restraint, and regularity.  Moreover, inmates had little to no contact with their families once admitted to an asylum.  The conditions in lunatic asylums throughout the South rendered inmates, like Johnson, ready to leave upon the first opportunity."],"display_date":"February 16, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-16","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2020,"title":"Threat of Slave Rebellion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-24","end_date":"1841-07-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter to his father John C. Burruss on July 24, 1841, John W. Burruss asked, ...do we not dwell in constant danger, are we not standing, rather [lying] down - sleeping on a smothered - not extinguished - volcano? John W. Burruss was expressing his fear of slave revolt, a fear he shared with many southern plantation owners. In his letter Burruss described a discovered slave revolt in West Felicia Parish, Louisiana, not far from Burrus's own Mississippi plantation. An overseer had overheard slaves having a suspicious conversation in the fields. The slaves were whipped until they confessed to plotting an uprising and revealed the names of their co-conspirators. One of Burrus's slaves, Lewis Campbell, was accused of involvement in the conspiracy. Burrus seemed certain that Campbell was a key player in the development of the scheme. He assured his father that the proper authorities had taken Campbell and the other insurgents into custody."," Although the revolt was quashed, the community was left in a state of upheaval. After southern white citizens discovered news of the rebellion many immediately became aggressive, lashing out against their slaves, though not to the infliction of death. Burrus went on to note that the trial would take place in August. He remarked that though the turmoil surrounding this event would eventually calm, tensions would remain as plantation owners continued to feel the threat of revolution. Slavery had a strong presence throughout Mississippi, but it was particularly deep-rooted in the delta at this time. Whites had established plantations there long before the rest of the state. In territorial Mississippi, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, plantation owners viewed slavery as a necessary evil. Despite many restrictions on slaves, slave owners rarely enforced these strict regulations. However, attitudes toward slavery quickly began to shift. By the end of the 1830s, slavery was considered not only beneficial for the slaveholder, but also for the slave. The plantation system proved to be so profitable that plantation owners used any ideological means they could to justify slavery. In the 1830s the number of slaves in Mississippi grew exponentially. By 1840, there were more blacks than whites in the state. As attitudes toward slavery changed and the black population grew, slaveholders became increasingly frightened of revolt. "," A slave insurrection, such as the one John Burrus reported, not only threatened the lives of slave holders, but also their economic welfare and social power. The institution of slavery and the social system it created were essential to the wealth of the plantation owner. Southern whites had witnessed the violence against whites wrought by Nat Turner, a slave from Southampton, Virginia, in 1831. Other plots of revolt had also been discovered throughout the South. After these events slaveholders were continuously ready for slave rebellion. Knowing that he had everything to lose, Burrus surely feared that Lewis Campbell was another Nat Turner."],"display_date":"July 24, 1841","search_date":"1841-07-24","locations":[{"id":5781,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2021,"title":"Mass Slave Runaway from McIntosh, GA Plantation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Things were looking promising on Mr. Thomas' plantation, Peru, in 1850. He owned over 150 slaves and 15,000 acres, all of which produced great wealth in the form of cotton and other crops. Most of his slaves had been reared on his plantation alongside him and his son ten-year old son, Edward. Both father and son felt they were very good to their slaves and provided them with ample food, clothing, and housing. Their generosity was such that Master Thomas even allowed many of his slaves to own guns, boats, horses, and to raise their own crops to sell to others. The Thomas' felt they treated their slaves in a fatherly fashion and called them our people, feeling that the relations between master and slave could not have been better anywhere. Both masters and slaves even went to the same church on Sundays, although the enslaved people had to sit in the back and take Communion last. Young Master Edward felt particular kinship with some of the slaves, as he played with them and requested barbeques on the plantation that everyone enjoyed. In the eyes of the Thomas family, life could not have been better for everyone on the plantation during the planting time of 1850. ","However, this content feeling disappeared when the largest slave runaway in young Edward's memory occurred just before the crop planting of 1850. Immense amounts of cotton were due to be planted, and it was a time when the most hardworking slaves were needed. At this crucial time eight or ten of Mr. Thomas' best slaves ran away, along with several other slaves from neighboring plantations, numbering fifty or sixty in all. The whites in the neighborhood were very angry at the fact that the runaways fled to the woods and outlying areas, and were surviving by stealing crops and cattle at night. Mr. Thomas and Edward were most distressed because in addition to ruining the slave-crop ratio needed for the planting, when the slaves left they felt as if fifteen thousand dollars had taken wings to itself and gone. The neighborhood did not see the runaways as men trying to obtain their rightful freedom, but as outlaws and menaces that had to be caught. The neighbors searched on horseback and with hunting dogs, and actually saw the runaways steal a boat and flee further into the woods but could not stop them. After that, nothing more was heard of the runaways until the first of December. That night, they came back to the plantation, sought out young Edward, and told him to tell Master that they were come in here. Master Thomas did not proceed to beat them but instead said he wished them to hell and later hired them out to a railroad contractor for the rest of the winter.","The runaway from Peru Plantation was in no way an unprecedented event for Southern slave owners, and runaways occurred for various reasons across the South. The living conditions of Southern slaves varied. Many were driven from sunrise to sunset, beaten constantly, had little food and terrible housing, and were given virtually no free time. However, despite the harshness of the institution of slavery, some masters were more lenient. Many told themselves they had to be good to their slaves because they were obligated to watch out for them and care for them in a fatherly manner. Many owners in Georgia also gave their slaves rations of meat, instead of just meal and corn. Some, like Mr. Thomas, allowed the slaves free time, which many used to tend gardens and sell their crops, as the slaves on Peru plantation did. Many masters, such as Mr. Thomas did not require their slaves to work on the Sabbath. However, even when slaves were given some leniency, as they were on the Peru Plantation, their masters were foolish to believe that their slaves were satisfied and placated by their master's paternalism and provisions. ","One of the biggest outlets for slaves to express their dissatisfaction was to run away. When they hid out like the Peru slaves, and as many others did across the South, it hurt their masters monetarily and unsettled the white community. It reminded them that their slaves were not satisfied, even if it did not totally ruin their delusion of being good masters. Slaves that fled, often raided crops and joined with slaves from other plantations when running away. These characteristics of the McIntosh runaways were not unique. Another common factor in slave runaways is that the slaves often only left for a short amount of time and sometimes returned of their own accord as did Mr. Thomas' slaves. It was hard for slaves as far south as Georgia to make it all the way to a free state and it was also hard for them to hide in a community where people would recognize them. Often they returned to their masters' plantations and the most common form of punishment was either being beaten or sold. Mr. Thomas did this on a lesser scale by hiring them out for a season. However Mr. Thomas felt, it can be assumed he was surprised by the slaves running away since he thought they had such wonderful conditions and relations, but this was what most slaveholders across the South believed. The nature of the McIntosh runaway was typical and shared many trends with other slave runaways in the South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":2023,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC INTOSH, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2024,"title":"Girl Chooses Death Over Shame\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The majority of farms in Brunswick, Missouri used slave labor up through the Civil War. H.C. Bruce was a slave on one of these farms. Many years after the Civil War, Bruce reflected on his experiences as a slave and recorded them in a book. According to Bruce, slave owners in Brunswick believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life. About nine miles from his farm lived a slaveholder named V. Harper. Harper owned quite a number of slaves, including one particular family that was respected by whites and blacks alike for their moral worth and character. In 1858, one of the daughters in this family, who Bruce described as having clean character, discovered that she would soon become a mother. This girl had not yet married nor was she engaged to a man at that time. Rather than dishonor herself and her family by bearing a child without a husband, she walked two miles to reach the Missouri River, plunged herself into it and was drowned."," During his account of the girl, Bruce acknowledged that it [was] not known who led her from the paths of rectitude. He also admitted however, that there would occasionally be a black mother with a very light-colored child. Bruce's diction suggests the slave was impregnated by her master. At that time, slaves were not considered as people, but rather as property. As property, slave owners often treated their slaves as they wished. Historian Joshua Rothman suggests, sexual contact between masters and slaves specifically and whites and blacks generally was commonplace in Virginia and in all slaveholding states. Because relationships between masters and their slaves were common in the antebellum South, it was reasonable that Bruce suggested such a relationship between the girl and her master. "," There are a few reasons why the girl in Bruce's account would have had sexual relations with her master. It was not uncommon in the antebellum South for a master to rape a female slave. As Rothman argues, a black woman's body was her greatest vulnerability. Rape was an effective weapon that slaveholders used to physically and mentally degrade their slaves. It was also a means to assert a racial hierarchy. Second, there were some instances where a slave woman would exchange sexual relations for preferential treatment on the plantation. However, the fact that the nineteen-year old girl drowned herself suggests that she probably did not engage in a sexual relationship to obtain preferential treatment on the farm. "," Though rape was not uncommon between master and slave, Bruce made it clear that slaves considered the action an attack on their honor and morality. Bruce stated that the girl decided that death was preferable in her case to disgrace. Rothman argues that in the antebellum South, a woman's honor resided in her sexual purity. The girl in Bruce's account realized that her pregnancy would bring shame to herself and her family. Instead of giving birth to her master's child, the girl decided to kill herself. With this action, she attempted to salvage as much of her honor and morality as she could."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":7480,"lat":39.5145426187,"lng":-92.9626052094,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARITON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2031,"title":"Erastus Brown Encounters Indians on His Way to Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-11-15","end_date":"1859-11-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Like many young, adventurous men in the nineteenth century, Erastus Brown decided to explore the new frontier of the United States. Upon returning home from a trip to Texas, he wrote a letter to his sister, Millie, asking her to accompany him on his next trip. In discussing his trip to Texas, Erastus described his encounter with the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw Indian Nations. He described the Cherokee people and remarked their land was the most lovely country [his] eyes ever beheld. He added that the Cherokee people seemed very well enlightened. However, Erastus did not think so highly of the Creeks. He considered the Creeks to be the most inferior of the three races. Erastus continued his focus on the Creeks, and gave a full account of the traditional Creek dance he witnessed. The Creeks gathered around a pole yelling, singing, and dancing in a manner that reminded [him] of the exact representation made in history of their 'war dances.' He remarked, Only the poor or inferior portions continued such dances. The superior Indian Nations [studied] the art of agriculture. "," Erastus Brown was not alone in wanting to travel to newly settled territories in the United States. In fact, historian Randolph Cambell titled his book, Gone to Texas, to represent the message that appeared on the doors of many abandoned homesteads across the southeastern United States in the mid-nineteenth century. While Erastus did not explicitly state his reasoning for going to Texas, Cambell offers many reasons why people from the southern United States felt comfortable leaving their homes for Texas. First, the U.S. Army established forts and explored the new lands, thus providing the stability needed for people to move into the new territory. Those who went to Texas wrote home about the opportunities the new territory offered -primarily cheap, rich land. Furthermore, like other new territories, slaveholders saw Texas as an opportunity to expand slavery. "," Although Brown did not mention the exact route he traveled on his way to and from Texas, it was likely he traveled through Oklahoma. He stated that he went through the Indian Nations: Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw. As historian Dallas T. Herndon states, the movement of Americans into the western frontier forced Native Americans to be relocated to reserves in Oklahoma and part of the Texas Panhandle."," Brown noticed the different effects that American expansion and the relocation of Indians had on the tribes he came across. He described the Creeks as being inferior compared to the other Indian Nations. The Creeks continued traditions and rituals from the past such as the war dance. Other superior Indian Nations, moved away from their traditions and [studied] the art of agriculture. Herndon states that the Choctaw - one of the Indian Nations that Erastus encountered - were the most skillful agriculturists of all the Southern tribes, cultivating a greater variety of crops and with better successes.

Cotton-picking was back-breaking work. Always in the past, though, slaves had worked the long hours in the sweltering heat. Slavery ended, but the demand for labor did not. Suddenly the planters had the job of enticing labor that had been so simple, if expensive, to secure just years earlier. They began to question just where that easy labor had gone.","The Milledgeville Southern Recorder addressed just this question in early 1869, at the same time revealing a great deal about white attitudes. Some whites, the Recorder begins, blame the mysterious absence of black labor on the railroads. The paper counters that this is only a partial truth. The greater drain, it insists, is the great number of black families who have a self satisfied confidence in their ability to run a farm of their own, thinking they know as much about cotton making or a little more so than did their masters. This, the Recorder prophesies, is a self-correcting foolishness. A year or two of experiment will give us plenty of negro labor as in days past, it insists, adding, by that time, they will get an idea in their heads as to their ability to be planters.","     In the heart of Radical Reconstruction, freedmen across the South grasped at one of their more central new freedoms - the ability to choose employment, including the right to work for no man but himself. Some chose the railroads, others paid work on plantations, but many chose to find land, whatever the cost, that they could own and farm. Such endeavors were difficult to keep running, however, with the great variance possible in cotton prices even year-to-year. The Recorder's article show an emerging strategy among whites of using control of capital, especially valuable land, to dominate black labor now that political oppression was - at least temporarily - less complete. Sharecropping, a policy where planters would grant a piece of land to farmers in exchange for a substantial portion of the harvest, would become a common arrangement across the South in the decades to follow. This arrangement, while preserving the idea of independence and self-employment, rarely allowed sharecroppers to escape poverty. Over time more complex forms of economic domination would develop. The expectations of black failure are no surprise. Rhetoric casting black men as foolish, innocent, child-like characters who simply needed time and experience to see the errors of independence would become standard throughout the region for decades to come."],"display_date":"February 1, 1869","search_date":"1869-02-01","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2039,"title":"Bold Burglary Blamed on Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-07-14","end_date":"1868-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of July 9, 1868, the bustling town of Milledgeville, capitol of Georgia, witnessed a daring burglary.

The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer. After burning much of the town to the ground, General Kilpatrick arrived and put a stop to the attack, though the Recorder's letter insists that he gave secret orders to burn the town after dark.","Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas focused on destroying infrastructure and demoralizing Confederate troops. With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2044,"title":"The Crisis of 1849\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-07-25","end_date":"1849-07-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shots went off. John Barker turned and sprinted towards his house, but the Indians were too quick. They overtook him, stabbing and killing him instantly. Caleb Lyndon Brayton, frontier neighbor to Barker, stood there stunned. He had just conversed with the Indian party on the road to Captain Gattis' house, seeing nothing unusual in their appearance. How could this have happened? The adrenaline flew through his veins: no time to think, get to the boats Brayton, Captain Gattis, and Colonel Russell flew down the hill towards the shore and pushed off just as the Indians, having doubled to eight, loaded their rifles. The first volley ripped through the shirt of a Negro man in the boat, but by the time they reloaded, the frontiersmen were out of range.","Brayton now had time to absorb what he just witnessed and plan a course of action. The men needed weapons, but, upon returning from obtaining Brayton's Colt 8 shooters, the Indians were no where to be found. The land lay in ruins. Houses were plundered and set ablaze and cattle floated lifelessly in the river. Colonel Russell's family was gone. The following day Brayton came upon the most distressing scene of his life: Here were a parcel of helpless women and children, bare footed and bare headed, and almost naked. The children crying and screaming for water and food, having been two days without anything to eat... They had found Russell's family downriver, but the horror of the past two days could not be escaped.","This was the scene Brayton described to his wife, Marian, who remained in Augusta, Georgia with their family while he settled the frontier of Florida. The Indians he refers to are Seminoles, and the attack and murder of John Barker was part of a larger reemergence of hostilities known as the Crisis of 1849. The Second Seminole War had been over for seven years, but a group of young Seminoles conducted raids up and down both Florida coasts in the summer of 1849. United States Troops mobilized and threatened attack but Chief Billy Bowlegs, who has been described as a great peacemaker, averted conflict by claiming the raiders were outsiders and defiant warriors. He delivered three prisoners and the severed hand of a fourth.","Scattered episodes of violence were not uncommon across the South wherever whites intruded into historic Indian territory, but the Crisis of 1849 was temporally concentrated and particularly horrific. Intricate racial interactions in Florida were augmented by the influx of settlers after 1842 and the peace that followed the Second Seminole War. Specifically, the Armed Occupation Act allowed prospective settlers to claim land and feel safer doing it; Caleb Brayton himself had claimed 160 acres in 1843 under this act. After 1849, however, many settlers did not return to this area and others. Billy Bowlegs had prevented a third Seminole war, but lasting damage had been done to the relationship between frontier settlers and the indigenous Seminoles.

He was someone to talk to, and he cooked a yellow perch dish that really would have done honor to your cuisine at home. McCall and John were deep in the Florida wilderness, surrounding a fire in Wahoo Swamp, and the Major General in the United States Army struck up a conversation with the young man. A dog was lying peacefully by John's side, and McCall asked him how he came to have his dog, a great Indian cur, and what its name was. He replied that the dog's name was fuse because the girl he was courtin' for a wife, and all de gal fuse me (refused me). Dis so provoking to me, I git mad. After their conversation, McCall described Gopher John as my friend in his journal spanning thirty years of service on various American frontiers.","Gopher John was McCall's interpreter because he had a special skill set of a Black Seminole, a population that is much forgotten in southern history. In describing the young man, the adjectives employed touch on his biracial connections. John had grown up from a long-legged, ill-looking Negro boy to be a fine looking fellow of six feet, as straight as an Indian, with just a smile of red blood mantling to his forehead. In addition to his physical features, John retains his cognomen with the Indians as well as with the whites who lived in the Indian country before the war. Other Indian Negroes were feared by the U.S. Army for their ability to recruit slaves from local plantations, but John was able to straddle the racial fence between whites and Seminoles and occupy a social purgatory. Major McCall had a vested interest in seeing that Gopher John did not side with the Seminoles.","The history of blacks in Florida, and how they came to be associated and intertwined with the Seminole nation, is a complex one. Under Spanish rule until 1763, Florida had become a refuge for runaway slaves, even granting them freedom for military service. Some Black Seminoles were descendants of those who fought for the Spaniards at the Battle of Fort Mose in 1738. They began to settle among the Indians who were friendly to the Spanish and remained there after Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Seminole Chiefs even bought slaves, and runaway blacks from plantations in Carolina and Georgia continued to merge with the independent communities of free blacks on the outskirts of Seminole settlements. Naturally, interracial interaction occurred-sexually, culturally, and economically. Blacks supplied agricultural produce in return for protection; they were the vassals and allies of the Seminoles.","The unique role of interpreter for both whites and Seminoles was filled by men like Gopher John. He had relationships with the two communities, but of equal importance was his relationship to Major General McCall. As evidenced in Israel on the Appomattox by Melvin Ely, absolute racial blocs were not present in the antebellum South; for instance, black batteaumen had intimate social connections with whites in the context of economics. The racial distinctions blurred between McCall and Gopher John, and although their relationship was intended to be formal and official, it became something more natural. Hybrid cultures developed on Israel Hill, in Florida between blacks and Seminoles, and elsewhere across the South as traits were shared between different races as they came in daily contact with each other."],"display_date":"April 18, 1842","search_date":"1842-04-18","locations":[{"id":1362,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"HILLSBOROUGH, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2048,"title":"Baylee, the Democrat from Eastville","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-01-01","end_date":"1892-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Baylee was a Democrat from Eastville, a town in Virginia's Eastern Shore. Baylee became a Democrat after an Eastern Shore county chairman approached him about an upcoming election. Eastville, with its sizable black population, had voted Republican in recent years. Democrats knew that wooing black voters with their often racist platform was difficult. One thing worked to the Democrats' advantage: most black voters were illiterate. The Democrats went to Baylee because he needed money and because he was black. After he was paid, Baylee told the Negroes on Monday night at their meeting not to call on [the] 'constables' for help as they would cheat them, but to guess at the name, which they did. The county chairman let his boss know that the Negro Baylee at this precinct did certainly manage his vote splendidly. As a result, the county chairman continued, [the Democratic] majority at Eastville was 72, where usually [the Republicans] get 200 majority. So I think Baylee carried out his part ... I will give Baylee his pay tonight.","Blacks in Virginia and Maryland fared better than those in other southern states: despite many attempts to restrict their suffrage rights, blacks in these states kept voting in the years after Reconstruction. However, even in these regions, blacks were political victims of deceitful tactics, racist attacks, and exploitation. Democrats would do anything to win elections during the years of Redemption, when they regained political control in the South. Tales of bribery like this one are common to both Virginia and Maryland, to rural as well as urban areas. Political machines provided patronage to anyone who could get out the vote for the party. Democrats also used racist attacks to secure their majority when elections seemed close. A Democratic candidate in 1889 claimed in a campaign speech, we have determined that this government was made by white men and shall be ruled by white men as long as the republic lasts."," The Democrats weren't the only ones politically exploiting blacks. The Republican Party never afforded blacks any true power in their organization, awarding them token positions on councils and token planks in political platforms. Blacks learned to expect little from their Republican allies. A petition sent from blacks to leaders of the Republican Party asks only that President Harrison ... appoint at least one coloured man to a Presidential Office in Maryland... Blacks formed protest groups, such as the Colored Equal Rights League, the United Brotherhood of Liberty, and the Maryland Progressive Assembly, but they accomplished little.

Mr. Hall began the discussion by encouraging the teachers to express their candid views on each topic covered over the course of the day. The first topic was whether teachers should allow whispering and talking during class. One young woman delivered an emphatic speech about the dangers of tolerating this behavior. Since everyone unanimously agreed on this issue, the group proceeded to the next topic: corporal punishment. There was a lively and animated debate. Since no consensus was reached, the teachers decided to postpone this discussion. They next talked about the best ways to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and other subjects. The body reached an agreement much more quickly on these issues, finishing just in time for lunch.","Few people were familiar with public schools in the 1880s, especially in rural regions like Virginia's Eastern Shore. If they could afford it, parents sent their children to expensive private schools at remote distances. However, nearby Accomack County had opened eight local public schools by 1886, and Richmond County wanted to close the gap. Taxpayers provided 1.126 per child for schools in the Northern Neck, inequitably distributed between white and black schools. Many people wanted to increase this funding for religious reasons. While the teachers disagreed about corporal punishment, everyone at the Institute understood the important role Christian principles would have in the budding school system. Accordingly, the Institute opened its session with a prayer led by the local Reverend. As early as 1875, concerned citizens held concerts of prayer to recognize the importance of studying the Scriptures in all of [the] schools.

There was not a hornet in sight. After planting the gunpowder in a small pile beneath the nest, Teddie focused his sunglass on the match. He retreated to the position of his companions. An explosion rocked the hornets' next, setting it ablaze. In half a second, hornets, which hummed like so many Minnie-balls, and came almost as fast, descended upon the trio. Two flew up Teddie's pantaloons. Bat turned to fly, when a hornet, coming straight as a bullet, struck him in the back of his head and lodged there... Lud could not escape the insects either.

Teddie and Lud were excited to befriend someone who knew his way around the country farm; it did not matter to them that Bat's skin was black. Bat's old master responds with sympathy towards the plight of the three boys, and isn't bothered that two whites have a black boy as their companion. Similar interracial interaction occurred throughout the Upper South; in southern Maryland, blacks and whites worked side by side shelling oysters. In Baptist and Methodist churches across Virginia, blacks and whites often worshipped together.

To preserve and encourage this particularly Southern sport, Hanson Hiss and other Maryland gentlemen founded the Elkridge Fox-Hunting Club in October of 1878. George S. Brown assumed the Presidency, but only on the condition that no bag-fox be used in any hunt. The Elkridge Club trained only the finest hounds, and all the Marylanders knew that Chesapeake Bay Retrievers were the fastest and sharpest of them all. The club bought its dogs and kept its kennel near Baltimore, but they hunted on the Eastern Shore.","Captain Greenbury Holt always joined the Elkridge Club in the chase. Hiss would remember in 1897 that Holt, despite his four score years, is still as enthusiastic a hunter as he was 50 years ago. The men helped Holt into the saddle, but everyone knew the Captain would need little else. With a cry the horses sprung into action, the dogs barking eagerly at the scent, and the men shouting, Hi, there ... At him ... To the scent Hi Hi Hi The fox disappeared over the crest of the hill, and the troop thundered after it. The Captain's horse was a solemn and dignified thoroughbred, who amble[d] at a coon pace. He fell behind the other riders as they entered the trees, but with his vast experience, Holt knew shortcuts and by-paths that brought him closer to his quarry. Just as someone pinned the fox, the Captain burst onto the scene: he [was] usually seen at the death, if there [was] anyone out there to see him.

Marylanders considered the gentlemanly and sophisticated sport of fox-hunting something uniquely appreciated in the South, which is why they founded the Elkridge Club. Hiss wrote several articles about fox-hunting in the Outdoors journal. He noted that fox-hunting is hell without a Southern hound like the Chesapeake Bay dog. He praised the exploits of Captain Holt, a former Confederate officer. He reflected that there have always been in the North ... a class who deprecated fox-hunting...

The big bell tolled, beckoning everyone to the benches. It was quite a congregation: almost 8000 people would attend some portion of the meetings. James Cannon, Jr. from Salisbury, Maryland, sat with this father and listened: the substance of the preaching was the same as ... [his] church back home. There was somewhat more pressure brought to bear upon the church members to bestir themselves to hunt the sinners, and stronger more impassioned appeals to the sinner to forsake their ways and return to God. People jumped and shouted Hallelujah, especially the older white men and blacks who sat in the front of the wooden tabernacle.","The next morning, James rose promptly at 7 a.m. as the big bell clanged. After breakfast, there was a time of prayer. In the two hours of free time that followed, James took the opportunity to meet different families from Virginia's Eastern Shore. At 10, the lovefeast began, with the preacher incessantly calling for another testimony, another testimony James attended religious services at 3 and 7:30. After the little children were tucked in their tents, there was one more evening service. Organ and piano led stirring hymns like Blessed Assurance and What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Despite all the preaching, the camp meetings were a mix of the secular and spiritual. At night, women traded recipes, and young children spent their allowance at the candy stand. Young men and women joined nightly promenades around the grounds. One night, James heard giggling in a girl's tent as he walked by. He entered and found the girls laughing at an old lady in a rocking chair nearby, smoking a pipe. Each time she rocked, her shadow expanded and contracted on the wall of the tent. James wasn't as amused: he explained to the girls that smoking was an evil habit. This was a lecture the girls would not forget for many years.","The original idea of the Turlington Camp Meeting was for Methodists, rich and poor, black and white, to leave the comforts of their normal lives for a time of rededication to Jesus Christ. Early on, there was dramatic revival at the annual meeting. Each year, the meetings grew more and more popular (in 1889, nearly 1,500 people showed up each night). They also became grander, finer, and more institutionalized. In 1876, the church added a wooden tabernacle. In 1891, they added a choir loft. The dresses of the ladies became fancier and fancier, and the expected time for testimonies became shorter and shorter. For the Turlington Camp Methodists, religion became more secular with each passing year. While Christianity declined in spiritual significance for many southerners in the late nineteenth century, other regions of the South still resisted secular influences. In the early years, northern Methodists from Maryland shared in the fellowship at Turlington. While newspapers reported the friendly and brotherly feeling between these groups during the Methodist Centennial Conference in 1884, the situation soured quickly.

One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity.

The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced.

West Virginia was no exception to this. A story ran in the Martinsburg Gazette on December 11, 1866 that a young African American boy living in Chicago, Illinois was supposedly turning white. Born to two African American parents, the pigmentation in the young boy's skin was becoming increasingly lighter beginning in early childhood. Six of his twelve other siblings and his mother also suffered from the same skin discoloration. Dr. Henry J. Reynolds examined the family to try to find the cause of the loss of skin pigmentation. After examining the family, Dr. Reynolds reported that the family was in general good health and the cause of the condition was attributed to a disease known as vitiligo, which impaired the function of the nerves that provided nutrients to different parts of the body. This impairment led to the uneven distribution of pigmentation. ","This episode demonstrates the ever present strain in race relations in the South. Although the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment granted freedom to all African Americans, providing them with the same rights as their white brethren, tension still remained between the races. It was not uncommon to hear the public opinion say that African Americans were biologically inferior to the white populations. Bill Tillman, a Senator in South Carolina during this time whose political opinion illustrates many people's sentiments in the South, felt that the African American population should not be given the same rights in the political, economic or social spheres as other whites. Therefore to have an African American boy's skin color become more similar to the white population is concerning to those like Senator Bill Tillman who wanted to keep the lines between the races distinct and freedoms curtailed. "," If this African American boy had lighter skin resembling that of a white person, the townspeople of Martinsburg would not be able to differentiate him from the other white people in the town leading to a blur in race relations. The African American boy with the skin color resembling that of a white man could lead to the community identifying him as part of the white population. Socially, he could court and possibly marry a white woman of the town without the stigma of an interracial marriage. By not being labeled as an interracial relationship, the family would not be subject to the discrimination against those engaged in such a relationship. It was not uncommon during the nineteenth century for neighbors and townspeople to bring charges against those in an interracial relationship. Such charges would be brought against the couples mainly out of their defiance to comply with the public morals, and so they would be labeled as violators to the laws of the land. Some judges would rule against these couples to demonstrate the community's disgust in a relationship that crossed the color lines and would charge the couple with a misdemeanor. Therefore, in the social world, a label of interracial marriage would then cast a stigma upon the couple barring them from the normalcy of life afforded to white marriages. Not only would the couple not be labeled, but their children would be legally white, since race was determined on the mother's side. Therefore, these children would be afforded the rights and privileges granted to the white population."],"display_date":"December 11, 1886","search_date":"1886-12-11","locations":[{"id":14331,"lat":37.1249593165,"lng":-81.560657943,"zoom":9,"place":"TAZEWELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2080,"title":"Brother&#39;s Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-01-03","end_date":"1897-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was Christmas Eve in 1896. Two African American brothers, James Grubb and Bud Grubb were making preparations for the holidays in Wytheville, Virginia. The two brothers had been heavily drinking while they were in town. Bud was described as being full up when they eventually returned home. Upon their arrival to their home, Bud began physically abusing his sister at which point James tried to intervene. Bud then attacked James with a razor, James then reacted by shooting his brother in the chest, delivering a fatal wound. James then fled the scene and managed to evade police apprehension. Almost a year and a half later, James Grubb surrendered himself to police for the murder of his brother, Bud Grubb. His bail was set at 500 dollars. His trial was set for later that month, but the outcome was unknown. ","A year prior to the conclusion of this criminal case, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, which enacted the separate but equal rule for the civil rights of African Americans. In response to this doctrine, the court system attempted to prevent Southern state courts from obstructing justice against African Americans by giving federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases. The purpose of this legislation was to establish a sense of equality among blacks and whites. Potential inequality could arise in the southern states where slavery and the oppression of African Americans had been legally allowable. However, it was also during this period Jim Crow laws, both formal and informal, were enacted in the region. Contrary to previous legislation to give federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases, the federal courts from Reconstruction onward consistently and frequently decreed Jim Crow segregation to be constitutional and consistent with the law of the lands. Not only did the Jim Crow laws affect African American standing both socially and economically, but also with respect to protection from the law. African Americans were subject to greater rates of incarceration and harsher sentences compared to whites who committed the same crime."," Also during this time, community-sanctioned lynching occurred, where mobs would take an alleged criminal (usually African American), torture, mutilate and kill them. The Grubb family murder would be less likely to result in a lynching because it occurred within the family and it occurred between two African Americans. Although the outcome of the trial was not reported, as a result of the Jim Crow laws and the atmosphere of unequal distribution of justice, the Grubb brother would most likely receive a harsher penalty then a member of the white community.

He saw little or no action in the war for his first eighteen months of service, but he heard reports from members of his regiment who scouted the movement of the Confederate army. He was taken aback when he heard that Confederates had adopted the practice of hanging black men to discourage them and others from joining the Union army. Southerners were determined to punish any black man caught fighting against the South. In a letter to his wife and family in New Hampshire, Shedd proclaimed, Alas For the poor slave It is great wonder to me that they do not rebel; they would if they were not the most quiet, inoffensive race on earth. Besides expressing sympathy for blacks in this letter, he also claimed that slaves in Florida appeared to be more intelligent, to speak better English, and to be better looking than those he saw in South Carolina. To his disappointment, however, there were still no public schools in Florida where people of all races and classes could learn that all men are created equal in the sight of God.","Although many Union soldiers, perhaps even Shedd himself, were still racist during the Civil War, Shedd and other Northerners did see the many benefits of enlisting black soldiers as early as 1862. For many Union soldiers, the violent acts of southerners towards blacks were shocking and repulsive. The large free black population, their perceived prosperity and employment opportunities, and the extensive presence of Union garrisons in Key West all combined to positively influence perception of black Floridians. For Shedd, his intense patriotism, longing for his family, and strong sense of morality is what led him to denounce the maltreatment of blacks. ","Despite Shedd's belief that brave black volunteers did not deserve to be lynched for fighting alongside white Northerners, the lynching of blacks by Southerners, about which Shedd heard reports, did not end with the war, but instead, only gained momentum. In fact, people frequently extolled the lynching of black men as a way to enforce segregation in antebellum Florida. Reconstruction-era violence and lynching was rooted in the determination of white Floridians to keep blacks close to the brutal system of slavery which existed in Calvin Shedd's time.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

He owned dogs, horses, and men-servants and maid-servants were born in his house, and the forests surrounding Jackson's plantation were plentiful with wild animals. In 1860, he and Charles Whitehead decided to practice their hunting techniques on his property. They camped by the side of his house to spend a few days in pursuit of the chase. They relaxed in the tent and laughed wildly as the negroes ran to prepare food and the little nigs looked on from every out-of-the-way corner. They sat and drank as the slaves cooked for them in one of those little disconnected kitchens so favored by your true darky cook, who, when not turning the corn-bread, stands in her red bandana in the doorway with her arms akimbo, looming as large as the wonderful fat woman in the Museum. (Akimbo is a body position in which the hands are on the hips and the elbows are bowed outward.) Jovial and relaxed, Whitehead and Jackson cracked jokes about Jackson's slaves while they worked to prepare dinner and to maintain Jackson's estate.","The slaves Whitehead described clearly lived and worked in close proximity to where Jackson interacted with his fellow white men. While most Florida slaves usually ate in their cabins, those that Whitehead described were charged with the task of cooking and were also allowed to eat supper near their masters. This led to intense ridicule and the formation of stereotypes and derogatory terms about domestic blacks that persisted for decades. In his written accounts of his hunting adventures in the Everglades region of Florida, Charles Whitehead used terms like nig and darky to delineate the stark contrasts he perceived between the blacks and whites on Jackson's property. Not being wealthy enough to own slaves himself, Whitehead probably did not have any direct interaction with individual slaves. Therefore, his perception of blacks was all the more harsh and impersonal. For Whitehead, as for many, poor treatment of slaves was a way to dehumanize the black race in such a way that negated any guilt on the part of the white race."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":1428,"lat":26.6841881812,"lng":-82.0889710874,"zoom":7,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2091,"title":"Jesse Willis Petitions to Keep Slave Families Together\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jesse Willis, administrator of the estate of Amanda Willis, asked the Marion County court for permission to sell land (rather than slaves) from Marion's estate to repay his debts. He claimed that selling the slaves could not be done without upsetting Amanda's children. Willis added, the slaves are all of one family, and [they are] mostly children which are constantly increasing in value. He did not think it was right to separate families of slaves when it could be avoided. He realized that for slaves, the slave trade was more than just a financial exchange. A one-time miscalculation on the part of an owner might lead to a life-changing sale for the slave, and Jesse Willis did not want this to happen to his family's slaves. Instead, he insisted on avoiding the separation of slave families.","There have been several court documents that reveal that there were other masters who looked out for the welfare of the slave family. Other owners, like the Sanderson's in Duval County and the Hanson's in St. Johns County, would almost never sell a slave and refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. In addition to court proceedings, slave and master accounts also provide information about master-slave relations and the preservation of the slave family. One slave remembers that he never had to do any strenuous work as long as he won in marbles when he played against slaves of other masters. His master's goal was to excite the ambition of his slaves and promote loyalty through kindness, not to depress their spirits by fear and punishment.","Despite the handful of other cases of kind masters who cared for their slaves, Jesse Willis' demand in the Marion County court was not typical of Southern slave owners. The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved.

The man claimed to be one of the Bourbon Democrats, those who would spill the last drop of their blood rather than apply such titles to such a degraded, worthless, inferior race... The editor could only think that in this day and age, almost 13 years after the war that had ended the institution of slavery in the U.S., it was the man who had sent this letter who was being brazen. The author of the letter, a Mr. Henry T. Earnest, was actually claiming to write on behalf of all Southerners. The editor's first hope was that there was no truth to that claim, after the progress the nation had made; his second thought was how deeply unfortunate it was that Mr. Earnest believed the whole South shared his extreme opinion. That he even still felt there to be a South with its own identity and opinions so alien to those of the rest of the nation was a barrier to all that had been fought over so recently. He chose to publish the letter in the paper- accompanied by a rebuttal. He picked up his pen and began to draft the response. He would address this letter to every reader of The Post who might be wondering what stand the paper would take on such a relevant and sensitive issue. He wrote, So long as colored people are permitted to vote, we will feel constrained to address them as human beings...The gentleman who addresses us should have shed his blood during the late war.

Despite the fact that the war had resolved the issues of slavery and secession of the South, there were clearly those who felt no such resolution. As Miss Halsell explains, the Bourbons only represented a small subset of the Democratic party; however, their ideas would proliferate widely as the nation continued to struggle with the issue of racial equality. These ultra-conservative Democrats preached white supremacy, and fought privately and publicly (as is evidenced by this letter in the news) to defend what they believed to be white Americans' superiority over black Americans. However, though there were many like Mr. Earnest who made their racist views known during the post-Reconstruction period, there were also those like the editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> who openly accepted and stood up for the black man's right to citizenship and the respect which that citizenship demands for every American."],"display_date":"January 19, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-19","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2109,"title":"Letters By Colored Messenger \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-12-24","end_date":"1874-12-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" A letter arrived for Jerry Hyland of Warrenton, Mississippi as the year 1875 began.

As historians William Cooper Jr. and Thomas Terrill have recorded, according to careful estimates, blacks reduced the amount of work they had done as slaves by more than a third. Landlords complained bitterly. Although this particular description focuses mainly on the agriculture output of black sharecroppers and day laborers, the shift from a slave labor economy to a wage labor economy would have affected the white Southern women who had relied on black labor for household tasks such as mailing letters just as it affected white Southern men who had relied on black labor for agricultural production."," Once unconstrained by the shackles of slavery, freed blacks were no longer forced into inhumane hours or a life of servitude at the beck and call of a slave-owner. But poverty kept many freed blacks locked into the same sort of lifestyle and labor in which they had toiled in the antebellum South. Cooper and Terrill note that by 1919 most blacks lived about where they had when the Civil War ended, in the black belt.

Too few escaped the seemingly endless cycle of poverty that had ensnarled too many southern farmers after the Civil War.

Every guest, despite their race, took part in the festivities which included feasting and dancing. The merriment lasted until five o'clock in the morning. At this event, white citizens of the town who were often divided on issues of religion and politics, came together in the spirit of solidarity to extend to the African American population of the community the right hand of fellowship.

When the Virginia planter died in January 1835, he left his entire Henrico County plantation and all its contents to his son, Randolph, to deal with however he saw fit. As the executor of his father's estate, Randolph decided to turn his father's gift into a fresh start by selling off everything from farm machinery and supplies to animals and utensils. He also put up for auction the most valuable part of his father's household: his slaves. ","In an advertisement published in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser, the younger Harrison outlined his father's possessions and invited all those interested to attend an auction. Randolph boasted he would be selling, 60 or 70 valuable Negroes...More valuable slaves are not to be found. Along with the slaves, Randolph allowed neighbors to bid on barrels of corn, feed, oats, work horses, mules oxen, cattle, sheep, pigs, and machinery: all the remains of a successful plantation in its prime. Slaves, however, were clearly the most attractive items for sale.","For the slaves on the auction block, this event was to be expected. Once an owner died, slaves could typically anticipate their own sale, and many accounts of slaves' passage into the world of the slave trade begin with an owner's estate being liquidated. Upon receiving this news, many slaves ran away. It is impossible to know whether any of Harrison's slaves fled upon hearing the news of his death, but the thought almost certainly crossed their minds. ","Randolph Harrison's boastful description of his father's slaves sheds light on another tendency in the antebellum South. Typically, slaves entering the market were divided into categories (No. 1, Second Rate, and so on) based on physical traits, temperament, and skill.

Leaflets advertising a lost dog or runaway cat grace lampposts and telephone poles on every street corner, many including descriptions, names, and last known whereabouts of beloved family pets. Like modern neighbors across America, slave owners in antebellum Richmond, Virginia advertised for the return of their lost property as well. Only in these cases, that property was a human.","A typical runaway notice appeared in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser in January, 1835 describing a fugitive slave named Billy and where he could be returned to if found. The advertisement included a reward (20), and a physical description. At the time of his escape, Billy was about twenty years old, stood six feet high, and was a skinny boy with a dark complexion. He also spoke with a slight stammer and had a scar near the corner of his right eye from a horse's kick that had barely missed blinding him. Billy's angry owner, Eliza S. Perkins, listed every one of these characteristics in her runaway notice and demanded that her slave be returned to her son in Richmond, or at least committed to jail. Ms. Perkins even speculated on where her fugitive might hide, explaining that Billy might be, lurking about Rocketts, in the city of Richmond, or in the town of Petersburg with the hope of leaving the Commonwealth, as his father is a sailor on some sea vessel which frequents those ports...Masters of vessels, she warned, are cautioned against receiving said boy on board.","Even though slaves of all types ran for freedom in antebellum Virginia, historians have found that 80 to 90 percent of runaways were male. Like Billy, most of these fugitives were young, single men in their twenties. The majority of these escapees made a run for it in the summer months. Ms. Perkins' advertisement made it clear that Billy had, left the plantation of my late husband in the month of July last. After the initial escape, fugitive slaves had to elude local informants, slave patrols, and bounty hunters. The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser was hardly unusual in publishing notices of runaways like Billy. Newspapers all over the South ran advertisements for the capture and return of fugitive property. If, and when, these runaways were found, every city in the South also had jails in which to hold slaves until their owners arrived to reclaim them."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2150,"title":"Dispute with Slave Trader\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-10-01","end_date":"1841-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1841, R. Ballard, a slave trader who owned property in Mississippi, brought a Federal suit against Henry Turner, claiming the Turner owed him 6,300 dollars. The bill was the remainder owed for forty-two slaves that Ballard had sold to Turner in 1835. Unfortunately for Ballard, Turner was quite unhappy with his purchase. He returned seven of the slaves to Ballard, declaring that they were either unsound or older than Ballard had told him they would be and demanded a full refund. However, Ballard would not take back some of the flawed slaves. Ballard refused to take back one slave on account of his being an idiot, and recommended that the slave be auctioned. Ballard also would not take back two older slaves, nor would he exchange others for them."," The bill for these slaves had accrued interest until the balance was 6,300 dollars. Turner refused to pay. He felt that he had been swindled by Ballard. Turner claimed that Ballard misled him with regard to the character and soundness of the slaves. Turner also claimed that he had been misinformed about the origin of the slaves. Finally, Turner alleged that Ballard charged him more interest than had been decided upon at the initial sale."," Whatever the outcome of the case, Turner viewed Ballard as a con-artist who propagated the plantation owners' negative views of the slave trade. Southern whites viewed slave traders as being fraudulent and malicious. They believed that most of the slaves being sold were flawed in some way, and that the slave trader was making off with an unfairly large profit. "," Slave traders capitalized on the expansion of southern territory. As more land opened up for cotton plantations, traders brought more slaves to Mississippi. By 1840, there were more slaves than white citizens in the state. The Mississippi Delta's proximity New Orleans, a major center for slave trade, fueled the influx of slaves. Plantation owners returned again and again to New Orleans to buy labor for their cotton fields. They viewed slaves not as people, but as investments. Turner's case displays this inhuman treatment of blacks in the slave trade. In the markets of New Orleans, slaves were treated not as humans, but as objects whose values could be quantified based on their age and appearance. Historian Walter Johnson calls this psychologically damaging treatment the chattel principle. The chattel principle is unmistakable in Turner's description of his transactions with Ballard. He viewed the slaves as assets that could be priced differently based on certain characteristics. Turner's case demonstrates that southern plantation owners viewed slave traders as being shamelessly dishonest and saw slaves simply as valuable pieces of property."],"display_date":"October 1, 1841 - October 30, 1841","search_date":"1841-10-15","locations":[{"id":6925,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2156,"title":"Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1832-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On January 30, 1832 The <em>Woodville Mississippian</em> published an extensive letter from Lewis Cass, the Secretary of War, to Andrew Jackson, the President of the United States. Cass was concerned about the policy that the government would take regarding the Native Americans living in the United States. Cass admitted that whites had harmed the Indians for the past two centuries, and he saw the need to make up for this damage. It would be best for the Indians, he declared, if they were moved west of the Mississippi River. Certainly if they remained in white communities their race would be eventually be destroyed. Cass argued that the average Native American was lazy and stubborn and feared the anger of the Great Spirit should he depart from the customs of his fathers. Because of these characteristics, Cass said, Indians would not realize that whites were genuinely attempting to help them. The best course of action would be to remove the Indians and let them learn from the example of the white settlers. "," The subject of Cass's letter was an important issue in Mississippi in 1832. Until 1830 the Choctaws and the Chickasaws possessed the majority of the land in Mississippi. This began to change immediately after Andrew Jackson assumed office. On January 17, 1930, Mississippi extended its governance over Native American lands, which forced the Native American tribes to move westward if they wanted to maintain their independent government. In the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek the Choctaws agreed to move westward, and in 1832 the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek removed the Chickasaws as well."," The removal of the Choctaw and the Chickasaw changed Mississippi on economic, social, and political levels. White males looking for new opportunities would have been ecstatic to open their local newspaper and see Cass's suggestions to the president. According to historian John Ray Skates, The Indian cessions tripled the public lands available for settlement and provoked explosive changes for the state of Mississippi. Suddenly a huge expanse of land was open and ready to be transformed into cotton fields. "," The plantation owners of Mississippi Delta, however, may have been less excited about the new abundance of land. As more and more people flooded into the remainder of the state, the old plantation owners in the river counties were quickly outnumbered and began to lose political power. Most of the new settlers were Democrats, unlike most of the politicians from the Delta. The new settlers moved the state capital out of the Delta, from Natchez to Jackson. Then, in 1832, the government of Mississippi declared universal suffrage for white men and terminated property holding requirements for office. The plantation owners of the Delta no longer had political control over the state. Although citizens of the Delta probably agreed with Cass that the Indians should be moved, ultimately, they were not happy with the political changes that resulted."],"display_date":"1830 - 1832","search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2160,"title":"Action on the Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-24","end_date":"1863-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Walter Guion wrote a letter dated Saturday, January 24, 1863, to Miss. Bessie Guion, his sister, in Adams County, Mississippi, describing his experiences as a Confederate soldier and relaying some of his emotions about the war. In the letter, Walter spoke of a fight that broke out on the fourteenth of January against a Yankee gunboat near Lauderdale, Tennessee. The Confederate gunboat that Walter was on, The Cotton, imposed considerable damage against the northern boat, but also bore the brunt of the battle. Walter described his intense feelings of fear when he first became cognizant that he was in a real skirmish, and then talked about his surprise that there were African American men among the Union forces. In a letter back to Walter, dated February 24, 1863, Bessie confesses to her brother that she fears for his life and worries about his safety on a consistent basis. "," The heart of the Deep South was easily accessed by the Mississippi River. The river provided a way of transportation for not only men, but goods needed for the war effort such as grain. Thus, it became increasingly important as the Civil War continued that the Confederacy provide fortifications in order to protect its banks and naval stores from the Union's gunboats which often proved technologically superior for the time. As the war progressed and the Union claimed more victories near and along the Mississippi River, such as at the Battle of Vicksburg, the North was able to build up many garrisons of its own along this crucial area. As thousands of African American men from Mississippi came to the Union's aid (more than seventeen thousand by the end of the war), they began to form the regiments occupying these Union garrisons and their accompanying gunboats along the Mississippi River. Thus, it is highly likely that Walter Guion found himself fighting against some of the very men who had escaped to Union strongholds from his very own state and perhaps even county. In a twist of irony, these African American soldiers were guarding the river fortifications within plain view of southern slave owners, their former masters. While naval warfare was not the focal point of the Civil War, it became increasingly important because it was the facet of the war in which many African Americans, especially from Mississippi, were allowed to participate, and prove themselves as men, in. White Mississippians, like Walter Guion, were the ones fighting against these blacks. The emotions that both sides felt, excitement over the idea of freedom by the blacks and anger over the idea of black insubordination by the whites, fueled these gunboat skirmishes to posses a considerable degree of contempt.

He realized Elick's plan when he could not find him at night and immediately, the following day, March 12, put Elick in jail for safekeeping and to ensure he could not escape. Two days after this, on March 14, Forbes gave Elick a severe whipping in hopes of finding out all of the details about his plan of running away, but was only able to confirm that the slave did truly intend on escaping. Placing Elick in jail again on March 15 after another unsuccessful attempt at literally beating the information out of him, Forbes released him on March 21, only to send Elick away on an errand, fearing the whole time that he would attempt to run to freedom at any moment."," Whether or not Elick did eventually run away is unknown, but his plan to escape was not unique. Many slaves entertained the idea of running away to the North, prompted by news about freedom for blacks from northern abolitionists that was creeping into southern territory. The southern belief that the Republican Party was out to destroy slavery caused animosity towards the North and during the year before the start of the Civil War in April 1861, tensions reached an all time high between the northern and southern states. The controversial election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted southerners to begin considering the idea of succession much more seriously. The northern abolitionist's rhetoric of freeing the enslaved African Americans did nothing to please white southerners like Alden Spooner Forbes who depended on the labor of enslaved people to earn a livelihood. The thought that this very same rhetoric of equality and freedom was reaching the ears of their laborers intensified the white southern secessionists' hostility towards the northern abolitionists. The fear of new ideas of freedom formulating in their slaves' minds provoked many, like Forbes, to be especially harsh on their laborers in an attempt to keep them from trying to escape."," Mississippi did indeed secede from the Union on January 9, 1861. People like Forbes who depended on the labor of slaves drove this secession because they could not imagine a world without slavery, like the one they thought northern Republicans would try to create. The thought that slaves would internalize the ideas of the abolitionists regarding their freedom from bondage frightened those who depended on their labor. It was this fear that prompted many of them, in Mississippi and the rest of the South, to use cruel methods, such as whipping, to try and convince them that life as an enslaved laborer was the only life for them.

The policeman said he would take them to the local jail where they could sleep, and then release them the next morning. Instead, the three men were detained for six days and made to dig post holes around the jail. After they were finally released, they complained to the mayor and he responded to them that they were lucky they were not sent to the state penitentiary. The Assistant Commissioner for the State of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands made an entry to the record regarding this incident, and also when he called upon the mayor about the situation. The mayor claimed it was common practice to arrest both African Americans and white people for what he termed vagrancy."," These were not the only three men local police detained after the Civil War. There were many instances in which local authorities attempted to undermine the Bureau's attempts at racial reform. Between 1865 and 1868, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution were passed. They granted African Americans freedom from slavery, citizenship rights, and the right to vote, respectively. In Mississippi, the state set about registering black voters, and the new state legislature even included some African American members. However, the Mississippi Black Code of 1865 vigorously sought to control the former slaves. Passed by former slave owners, it provided that blacks had to have special licenses if they were not regularly employed. The acts were used as justification for detaining the three men in Jefferson, County, because they did not have these special papers, and were thus subject to the fines and jailing that happened to many like them. "," The former slaveholders sought to control the newly freedmen in a legal fashion through these black codes. The formation of the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan, sought to force blacks to do certain things through the use of terror. The Klan first actively showed itself during the 1868 elections where they used violence and intimidation aimed at African Americans to deter them from the voting polls. Their hatred spread to black schools, teachers, and churches. The federal government stepped in with the Enforcement Act, which allowed that Klan members would be tried in federal and not local courts, but this had little effect on decreasing their activity. So, while attempts were made to give the newly freed blacks the rights they deserved, an underlying hatred still existed towards them from their former masters and other white southerners.

With very little money or land of their own, they were often unsure of how or where to proceed next. A system of sharecropping thus evolved where the newly freedmen rented tracts of land from landowners and were expecting to give the landowners a portion of the profits made from the crops harvested on that land. Labor contracts were then signed arranging the details of what was expected of the freedmen and of the landowner.","On February 17, 1865, newly freed Henry Kanes, signed a contract with Chandler Sueham in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The contract allotted that Sueham, the landowner, would provide Kanes with the land and tools necessary to produce a crop, and in return, Kanes was to attend to Sueham's flock (no specific animal stated), as well as pay Sueham back one-third of the profits he gleaned from the land. Contracts like this led to discontent between the sharecroppers and landowners because they often felt like the other was not holding up their end of the bargain. Disputes arose because of beliefs that perhaps the sharecropper was not working hard enough, or that the landowner was not providing what was agreed upon in the signed contract. The Assistant Commissioner for the state of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land, reported to General O.O. Howard on November 28, 1868, that there had been many complaints filed recently about these labor contracts. The problems reported were specifically prompted by an upcoming election for delegates to the state convention that had impelled many freedmen to leave their work for the purpose of attending meetings held by political aspirants. The landowners from the Mississippi delta region were particularly unhappy because the laborers had missed several prime harvest days for the meetings, and they felt that the crops had thus faltered. "," Instances like these led to the precarious situation that Mississippi found itself in after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The majority of the newly freed people were generally unable to use what little savings they might have had to buy land of their own. Thus, they once again found themselves having to answer to a superior, who was normally a white man. The sharecropping system, originally intended to help the freed people on their way towards full independence had thus began to resemble the system of slavery that had prevailed for so long before it. The labor contracts were usually heavily weighted in favor of the white landowner, and the wages earned by the sharecroppers were so low that black women and children found themselves having to work so the family could survive. Women usually kept house for white families, and children engaged in seasonal field labor. Thus, emancipation did not eliminate the need for large amounts of labor in the South, and the labor contracts that resulted only slightly increased freedmen's control over their situation. In places like the Mississippi Delta, entire freed families found themselves working in order to make ends meet. Labor contracts gave the newly freedmen some sense of independence from white masters, but the conflicts that arose from the differing opinions of the laborers and landowners led to discontent among the majority of southerners dealing with the system of sharecropping."],"display_date":"February 17, 1865 - November 28, 1868","search_date":"1867-01-08","locations":[{"id":7123,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2177,"title":"Death of the Respectable Adam Grove\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-24","end_date":"1842-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shermariah Church, the Presbyterian Church of Augusta County, Virginia lost a valuable member of their congregation when Mr. Adam Grove died suddenly and unexpectedly on February 24, 1842. Mr. Grove's spirituality transcended Shermariah into the educational realm in that he served as a professor of religion for 20 years. His religious beliefs manifested themselves in his charitable nature. He donated a significant portion of the land on which Shermariah Chuch was constructed and also donated funds to help build the Shermariah Academy. Unlike many of the deaths that occurred in Augusta County in the antebellum South, Mr. Grove's was unique in that he died free of debt. His lack of debt can also be attributed to his religious beliefs. Grove was very familiar with the scriptures and lived by them. One such scriptural saying was, owe no man anything.","It was said that Mr. Grove's farm reflected many of his admirable characteristics such as his good management and industrious habits. Though he possessed only a small piece of land, it was lucrative due to its high state of cultivation. At the time of Mr. Grove's death, the land was worth two to three times more than if he had bought two to three additional pieces of farmland. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Mr. Grove's death, however, is the fact that one of his servant women died about 15 minutes after he did. She was also a member of Shermariah Church and it was believed by the citizens of Augusta County that they had both gone to the same blessed reward. ","The dichotomy of this obituary lies in the fact that during life of earth, slaveholders of Augusta County treated African Americans not only as their inferiors, but as their property; meanwhile, they sat through church services in the same sanctuary. They worshipped the same god and believed that they experienced the same afterlife. The role churches played in race relations of the antebellum South is a major theme in Melvin Patrick Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>. Ely portrays a culture similar to that of this obituary, where blacks and whites attended the same churches. These churches nurtured the moral similarities of people of both races. Furthermore, according to Ely, churches leveled the playing field between whites and blacks by acknowledging the spiritual gifts of each, and by identifying their equal ability to sin. During the 1840s and 1850s, white evangelicals felt it was their duty to bring black members into their churches. Spending on ministries to slaves increased dramatically. In the Methodist Church in particular, it increased from 167,258.87 in 1829 to 1,706,207.70 by 1864.

In this segment readers found many lighthearted topics including a sequence of imaginary situations reflecting both the political and social atmosphere of the era.  In addition to jokes about the fancies of women, the life of the theater, and medical issues, in 1830 a series of these verbal caricatures depicted trite Irish figures. While the jokes of <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> did not overtly display strong nativist doctrine, their obvious use of stereotypes portrayed the Irish in a very discriminatory manner.  ","Some jokes attempted to discredit the Irish as simply stupid and absurd while others furtively attacked their character, principles, and culture. The Irishman's War, published on March 12, 1830, subtly ridiculed an Irishman for his discourse and ignorance of geography.  From his rough, uncultured speech and lack of basic knowledge, this joke depicted the Irishman at an everyday laborers' task - a low-paying, unskilled job for an unskilled laborer. Another joke from April 16, 1830 crafted a crude, nonsensical analogy into an Irish priest's sermon in order to ridicule the Roman Catholic Church.  Through the absurdity of this sermon, the joke attempted to discredit the parish priest and the Roman Catholic Church, which endorsed such men in its pulpits. While the message was subtle in both of these jokes, the Virginian audience would have recognized the subliminal messages in both situations.  ","The Price of a Milkmaid in Ireland, published on February 12, 1830, stealthily commented on the moral nature of the Irish people.  The joke read: A young gentleman of Kilkenny, meeting a handsome milk maid, near the parade, said, 'What will you take for yourself and your milk, my dear'  The girl instantly replied, 'Yourself and a gold ring sir.'  While not obviously discriminatory, this joke implied an inherent impropriety within Irish culture, the predatory nature of Irish men, and finally, the easy, indiscrete manner of wooing Irish women. A joke published the following week took greater pains to criticize the Irish more overtly: An Irishman walking along perceived a receipt book fall out a gentleman's pocket just before him. Paddy picked it up, and observing a note sticking between the leaves, he took it to himself, and then called very honestly after the owner, 'Now, halt a bit, man See, here's your book that ye dropped on the pavement - but somebody has stolen a fifty dollar bill out of it'  This joke attempted to undermine the moral values of the Irish by insinuating that Irishmen could not be trusted.  The word Paddy, a common term for all Irishmen, also reflected the racial culture of the South; in using this word, the joke attributed dishonesty to the nature of all Irishmen.","In all, the Irish unnerved the South because they were unfamiliar incomers. Ironically, southerners discriminated against the Irish - fellow white men - and subjected them to harsh, public stereotypes while, as Melvin Ely notes, they were able to live with blacks. The massive wave of Irish immigrants around this time heightened the nerves of some southerners who resented the increasing numbers of foreigners usurping jobs and opportunities; thus, by 1830, the Irish had become a controversial ethnic group in society, inciting strong nativism and discrimination that eventually culminated in the bloody riots of 1844 in Philadelphia and Baltimore.  David Gleeson maintains the controversial opinion that while the South still maintained its usual social obstacles, in comparison to the North it did not show such intense resentment and hostility toward the Irish because they constituted such a small percent of the population and were appreciated as another source of labor.  Yet, even if his analysis is correct, as a border state Virginia was much more exposed to the fierce nativism growing in the North and would have thus been more susceptible to internal discrimination against the Irish than perhaps other states of the deeper South. Furthermore, the jokes of <em>The Virginia Advocate </em>suggest that in Albemarle County a lingering uneasiness toward the incomers persisted, making southerners uncomfortable enough to try to discredit them in jocular situations."],"display_date":"February 12, 1830 - April 16, 1830","search_date":"1830-03-15","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2182,"title":"Albemarle Women Hold a Fair for Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-14","end_date":"1830-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 14, 1830, after months of anticipation, <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> celebrated the triumph of a grand fair held in aid of the American Colonization Society by the Female Association of Albemarle County.  The newspaper proudly proclaimed that it went off with a success, which we believe has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its friends.  Despite the heat of the day the decorated hall attracted great crowds with its cool refreshments and informative exhibits about colonization. Although the paper did not report the total amount of money raised, it praised the women's philanthropic motives to help black colonists overcome the disease, famine, and...hostility...[that] threaten [a new colony's] feeble and precarious existence.","This altruistic effort by women was not unusual in the antebellum South; women commonly managed associations for the sick and poor, but it was their desire to assist free blacks that distinguished these women from later women of Virginia.  The women of the Female Association of Albemarle County were largely upper class women who lived in a slave-based society and yet, because of their fear of violence and desire for missionary activity, they staunchly supported colonization when they might have considered themselves above such a concern.","The recent slave rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, and Nat Turner in 1831 were only too recent in the minds of southerners and had generated great social fear, particularly for Virginians.  In these revolts, slaves had revolted against the rule of their white masters and free blacks had violated the privilege of their freedom, labeling themselves as a threatening group of people who endangered the property of the South. The violence of these revolts particularly endangered white women and children who had been among some of the blacks' first victims.  As an act of self-defense therefore, Albemarle County's women joined in the intensified protests on behalf of African colonization to reduce the unnecessary and dangerous amount of blacks in the South.","Other Virginian women hoped that colonization would spread Christianity in Africa. The women of Albemarle specifically praised the American Colonization Society for its desire to plant a germ of christianity and civilization, which will spring up to bless Africa, whose fruit will sustain the principles of Liberty in unborn generations.  As Robert Johnson, Jr. discusses, these women, along with many other southerners, credited slavery as the institution that had introduced Christianity to blacks; for this reason, they hoped that the free blacks who emerged from the system of slavery as Christian, civilized beings could spread these virtues to all of Africa.","On June 1, 1830, only a few weeks later, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>published a brief letter addressed to The Reverend Mr. Gurley of the American Colonization Society concerning the funds raised from the Albemarle County fair.  The Female Association offered the Reverend a gift of 500 dollars to aid the Colonization Society and requested that a lien be retained on the funds contributed by this association, by which, at any future period, any free people of color from this county, who may wish to go to Liberia, shall have the precedence of all others in any embarkation, at least to the full amount of the funds contributed by this association.  The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported this news because the state of Virginia had one of the largest networks of colonization chapters in the United States and many would have been encouraged by their efforts.","Other states would have also been interested because during this era similar support for colonization was prevalent throughout the South.  Johnson contends that while some in the South displayed a genuine humanitarian concern for the well-being of blacks, the majority of southerners advocated colonization on account of their fear of black rebellion, the uncertainty concerning the future of free blacks, and the lagging economy. In Johnson's view the South believed colonization would protect the value of the slave property and remove those Africans who were an economic drain upon the plantation system. Thus, the American Colonization Society became a popular cause in the South but for a variety of different motives."],"display_date":"May 14, 1830 - June 1, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-23","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2185,"title":"Thomas Jefferson Randolph&#39;s Controversial Opportunity to Assist the Choctaw Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-03-08","end_date":"1837-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the mail arrived in Albemarle County on March 8, 1837, Thomas Jefferson Randolph may have been surprised to receive a letter from R. G. Nicholas informing him that he had been nominated and accepted as Com[missioner] for settling claims to reservations under the Choctaw Treaty.  As a prominent gentleman from a well-established Virginian family, Randolph was a natural choice for the position except that the Choctaw Indian tribe lived in Mississippi, far removed from his native state of Virginia.  By the 1830s Virginia no longer had internal incidents with Indians because the nation's frontier lines had expanded and pushed tribes farther west.  But even residents of Albemarle County would have been very interested in the future of the Indians because these tribes lived on very precious land within the South's cotton economy.  ","Although the Choctaw tribe had recently earned distinction in the War of 1812 and had been declared the perpetual friend of America on October 24, 1816, when Mississippi became a state in 1817 the Choctaw Indians threatened the American identity of the new state.  They not only proved a problem for settlers wishing to move to the frontier, but moreover, by continuing to act as an independent nation within the United States, the Choctaws threatened the authority of the Mississippi state government. Grateful for the stability and unity of their own community, Albemarle County residents and other southerners would have expressed concern that the Choctaws posed an obstacle to greater prosperity of the South.  For this reason, political leaders throughout the 1820s and 1830s searched for ways to push the Choctaw westward onto territorial lands that were not officially part of the United States. ","In September of 1830, Andrew Jackson's administration finally concluded the treaty referred to by Nicholas as the Choctaw Treaty. Officially known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the treaty removed the Choctaw Indians west of the Mississippi River and claimed all lands east of the river as the property of the United States.  But Article 14 of the treaty decreed that if any Choctaw Indian agreed to become a citizen of the United States, the U.S. government promised to give them a parcel of land on which they might live and farm.  Nicholas' letter alerted Randolph that he had been nominated to assign these pieces of land to those Choctaws who chose to remain. In presenting him with all of the particulars of the position, Nicholas informed Randolph that his pay would be three thousands dollars a year and that though there would be little personal risk involved the position would require ten or twelve months of his time.  But overall his letter drips of resentment towards the Indians who tried to remain in Mississippi because he considered it a cowardly last attempt to avoid removal.  His bitterness was obvious when he commented to Randolph that, if he accepted the position, his job would require him to assist some of the greatest scoundrels in the world. Nicholas doubted the sincerity of the Choctaw who had chosen to remain and suggested that he would be relived to hear that Randolph had declined accepting the appointment.","A week later, on March 14, 1837, Randolph received the official offer from R.B. Poinsett officially offering him the position of Commissioner to adjust claims to reserves of land under the fourteenth article of the treaty with the Choctaw Indians.  While there is no sign of Randolph's acceptance or refusal of the appointment within these two letters, as seen from Nicholas' letter, such a position would certainly have been debatable in southern society.  While some, like Nicholas, might have resented the Indians as a threat to the unity of the South, others would have defended the Choctaws' rights to the land and would have been grateful for the government's merciful offer to the Indians.  Thus, Randolph's appointment presented him with a quandary in the antebellum South as southerners struggled with their desire to expand and the existing Indian population."],"display_date":"March 8, 1837 - March 14, 1837","search_date":"1837-03-10","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2187,"title":"Courtroom Drama in Black and White at Cumberland Court\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-09-02","end_date":"1834-09-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a long day of riding through the rain to Cumberland Court, Carter H. Harrison sat down to record the exciting events of the day in his diary and proudly declared, I defended and cleared a negro charged with an attempt to kill by poisoning.  Although Harrison records no further details of the proceedings, this account of September 2, 1834 reflects daily life of the local court system in the South - a realm in which blacks and whites met frequently.          ","While it is unclear whether the negro of Harrison's story was a free black or a slave, both parties commonly appeared in court and both were subjected to a legal system ruled by white men.  Surprisingly however, these white men did not always champion racial prejudice in their role as jurors.  In rural counties of Virginia similar to Albemarle, Melvin Ely notes that often times white juries had personal contact with those involved in the cases and thus, jurors tended to judge them as individuals whom they knew, not as appendages of that abstract, aggregate free black category against which legislator and editorialists aimed racist laws and rhetoric. The court juries thus ironically treated free blacks similarly to other free white men of similar social and economic standing; Ely comments on this unforeseen pattern by remarking a slaves' status as a free man, more than his color or previous condition, governed his treatment by the legal system.  The Virginia courts therefore affirmed the free black man's status in society as higher than that of a slave but failed to record exactly how he should be treated; thus, for many years, free blacks enjoyed moderate courtroom equality based on their undefined role in society and were able to benefit economically from their freedom.","If the negro that Harrison acquitted were a slave, that individual was very fortunate because slaves, in contrast to free blacks, lived in a brutal system of dominance and submission that also transcended the legal system.  Courts in rural, agrarian counties such as Albemarle had little sympathy for slaves who committed crimes against their white masters or neighbors and often issued harsh punishments such as death or exile. The courts did however, try to protect slaves who experienced excessive violence at the hands of their masters but juries hesitated to legally ascribe a slave's death to a beating for fear it would jeopardize the owner's dominance over a slave.  Therefore, courts extended minimal protection to slaves but were always mindful of their primary duty to protect the dominance of the white man and his property.  ","Often times Virginian slaves were made to appear before a called court - a court-like panel specially designed to hear slaves' cases within ten days of their apprehension. Five men sat on this panel and had the power to determine guilt and fix a permanent sentence that could not be appealed.  But the slaves were not helpless in these courts because the panel provided them with a defense attorney and required a unanimous decision in order to convict.  If a defense attorney could not be contracted before the trial, the panel postponed the date because it wanted to reach a fair decision. Although defense attorneys were often assigned minutes before the trial, they often times reduced the charges and could even exonerate the slave.  In 1832, a new Virginian law expanded the jurisdiction of the called courts to include free blacks' cases as well so the negro that Harrison defended could have been a free black or slave whose trial may have also occurred before this type of panel-court.","In his diary, Harrison expressed some disgust at the thought of having to defend people below him when he reflected upon his reasons for never seriously pursuing law as a profession.  He explained that the profession had rendered [itself] odious...by too close a contact with the vicious and illiterate classes of society.  Therefore, although he successfully acquitted a black man in court, by 1834 whites like Harrison challenged the black man's privileges because of his inherently inferior nature. But despite these existing tensions, the courtroom was ultimately a place where blacks could attempt to protect their dignity as well as a realm in which black and white interacted together, albeit unequally."],"display_date":"September 2, 1834","search_date":"1834-09-02","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2199,"title":"Savannah Reverend Addresses Religious Conditions of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-05-01","end_date":"1846-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Dexter Clapp of Savannah, Georgia got word of a question put forth in a newspaper, presumably by a Northerner, about the religious condition of slaves in the South. Clapp felt compelled to write a letter to the editor discussing his opinion on the matter. He stated that much of what he had to say was probably not known in the North, but was common knowledge in the South, or at least in his region of Georgia. He spoke of the enormous religious capacity of Southern slaves and the wonderful ways they took to Christian morals, even while in the lowest sphere of society. He also commended white Christians of the South who made it their duty to spread the Gospel to slaves, and said that the care of the spiritual wants of slaves were being given more and more attention by whites. He said that while in cities like Charleston, slaves and masters were often in the same churches and he found that encouraging, in Savannah blacks usually had their own churches. He stated that this was not a bad thing, and that slaves had their own black leaders and clergymen and had independence in their religious worship. Also, he mentioned that the majority of slaves went to church; the largest black church in Savannah having over fifteen hundred members. He also referenced a free black preacher who was not only was the highest paid preacher in the entire city, but who also was immensely successful in preaching to illiterate slaves, and making the Gospel applicable to their everyday lives. He commented that these slaves were as good of Christians as their educated masters. He also claimed that the black preacher seemed to be a defender of slavery, while that may be questioned by many historians. In general, Clapp described Christian slaves as good believers who seemed to have a kind and affectionate nature, a great capacity for love, and a docile and imitative manner, which made them accept the religious ideas presented to them. His letter made clear that he wanted people in the North to know that slaves' religious needs were not only cared for, but that most slaves were exceptional Christians who exhibited many of the best Christian virtues. He made sure to include that white Southerners were perfectly capable and concerned with bettering and supporting the spread of the Gospel to their enslaved people.","Much of what Dexter Clapp had to say on the state of slave Christianity was true, although he described some of it in a very condescending and insulting way, which was indicative of the feelings many white Southerners had towards slaves. He was right in saying that there were many people, missionaries and ordinary folk alike, who saw the importance of sharing the Gospel with slaves. With the rise of Protestantism and the Great Revival in the 1830's, many missionaries made it their work to preach to slaves. Many slaves did respond to message for several reasons, though not as Clapp said: because they had an imitative manner that would make them accept anything presented to them. Although many white Southern Christians claimed dominance over their slaves, slaves could feel equal before God. It also strengthened their families and communities, which was vital to keep their society together during the terrible conditions of slavery. Also, the idea of an equal Heaven was central to the hope that maintained many slaves throughout their lives. Christianity gave slaves freedom to participate in white churches or in their own churches, where they had the freedom to hear their own preachers and socialize with fellow enslaved Christians. Even white men who heard black preachers, said they could not find more enthusiastic ministers or more emotional and genuine church members anywhere. However, some slaveholders feared that religion would cause slaves to rebel, and these whites used the Bible to justify slavery. However, other masters may have truly cared about the salvation of their bondsmen and encouraged them to be Christians. The patronizing way Clapp spoke of the imitative slaves in Georgia was indicative of the opinion many whites had about white supremacy and supposed black infantile nature, but they could not have been more wrong. Although Clapp spoke condescendingly of the docile and imitative nature of the slave, he did not know that slaves often met in secret for their own prayer groups and sermons, where they strongly addressed issues other than obedience to their masters. They discussed freedom and prayed for it, and they sang and danced, and gave way to the feeling of the Spirit. While whites may have seen slaves as docile and meek people who whites actively converted, slaves used their religion and its spread, to create new hope and a stronger culture than ever for African Americans across the South."],"display_date":"May 1, 1846 - May 30, 1846","search_date":"1846-05-15","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2201,"title":"Slave and Master Cross Ocmulgee River\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Robert Anderson was just a young boy when he became a house servant in a Liberty County plantation home. He cleaned the knives, swept the floors, and later tended to the sheep, cows, and hogs. Robert's mistress thought a great deal of him and kept him around the house as much as possible. In Robert's words his mistress felt that nothing went right if I [Anderson] did not have something to do with it. His mistress even allowed him to be taught how to read until she found out this was against the law. His place in the household was one of a very responsible and dependable slave, and this influenced him later in life. When Robert was close twenty years old, his master, Dr. Anderson, decided to move to Glynn County, Georgia. Robert decided to go with him even thought it was hard for him to leave his home. However, it did not seem that he was forced to leave, because he stated in his own autobiography that he went with Dr. Anderson because the doctor was his master and they thought a great deal of one another. An episode that shed light on at least one aspect of their relationship was when they were traveling across the Ocmulgee River. The ferryman struck Dr. Anderson's horse and they argued for a bit and then left the ferry. When they got off, Dr. Anderson asked Robert what he would have done if the ferryman had struck him [Dr. Anderson], instead of his horse. Robert replied vigorously that he would have knocked the ferryman into the water. His master replied thankfully, and pledged that since they were in a strange county now he would make sure to also defend Robert whenever necessary. He firmly stated he would not let anybody take advantage of Robert. Thus on the banks of the river, they pledged themselves to one another and remained so until he [Dr. Anderson] departed this life.","It may seem surprising that a slave and his master seemed truly fond of one another, when in many cases slavery was brutal and did not seem to have a warm, emotional side to it. However, it is important to remember that many masters told themselves it was their duty to take care of their slaves and to be fatherly caretakers. Also, it is important to remember that Robert, and other house slaves, were in close proximity to their masters for most of the day, if not night. This obviously led to some sort of bond, though unequal, to their master and mistress. White women and children across the South often became very attached to their household slaves- people who cleaned for them, nursed them, and raised them. Field slaves often would not have enjoyed this privileged or warmer relationship with their masters. Even though the slave-master relationship was in no way equal, and whites would not like to admit it: both masters and slaves (especially house slaves or slaves on smaller plantations) depended on one another, and were more intimate than one would guess. Both Dr. Anderson and Robert probably felt safer together with someone they had known for decades, since they were in a strange new county. Of course their relationship was imbalanced, as all master-slave relationships were, but it was obvious in many cases that slaves were a form of comfort to their masters. Many slaveholders felt that their slaves were their own people and sometimes had a degree of sentimental feelings towards them. Many whites felt that they really knew what was best for their slaves. Slave-owners often defined themselves by their slaves and whether this brought about a semi-good or bad relationship, it brought out a relationship nonetheless. No matter how unequal the relationship was and no matter how rare it was for slaves and masters to have this affection for one another, his fondness for his master and his master's apparent fondness for Robert made a lasting impression on the future Reverend Robert Anderson for the rest of his life. He was not the only slave in the South who had a more positive relationship with his master than many people would have believed was possible, but it is still important to remember the brutal aspects of slavery, and that even these positive relationships were still not equal or just."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":1836,"lat":31.0887336961,"lng":-81.4509546531,"zoom":9,"place":"GLYNN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2204,"title":"Major Townsend&#39;s Letter\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-12-21","end_date":"1837-12-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Major Edward Davis Townsend was in an alien land. He had made it a long way from his home in Boston to be a surveyor for the city of New Smyrna on Florida's frontier, and he missed all the pretty girls greatly. In a letter to his mother, Eliza Gerry, he described his new environment. He asked her to imagine to yourself me with my jacket off, covered with mosquitoes and sand flies, trampling through thick brushes, and running lines over rough paths cut out of hammocks. In 1837, the Second Seminole War was raging in Florida. Mrs. Townsend worried about her young son, a thousand miles away and fighting a war against the indigenous Seminole nation on behalf of the citizens of Florida. ","Townsend, however, kept her updated on the war news. General Eustis had recently assumed command of the Eastern Army after General Hernandez had allowed an Indian retreat to the south. Troops were building up in the county preparing to drive the handful of little wretches in our direction. Townsend's descriptions of the Seminoles were contrasting and flecked with both racism and respect. Later, he called the warriors respectable and distinguished, but referred to Chief Big Billy as a consummate rascal...a dark looking and immensely powerful savage. The chief he called Powell was a peaceable and consistent diplomat who also maintained a brilliant mind for guerilla war tactics. When in St. Augustine, Townsend had the honor of shaking hands with Old Phillip, Big Billy, Blue Snake, a friendly Seminole, and many others. His encounters with these war chiefs were of great importance to him, and he related these experiences to his mother.","The letter is a narrative of an outsider to the territory; Florida was still very new to Major Townsend. He arrived there having limited interaction with Indian populations, and his descriptions were powerful in their untainted perspective of a foreign environment. He consciously picked adjectives to describe these warriors and chiefs based on what he had witnessed, and reinforced them with what he had heard: stories of battles, massacres (Dade), and conversations with white Floridians. Powell, as Townsend called him, was better known as Chief Osceola to the Seminoles and later to all Americans, as his fame spread. Townsend treats him with great respect, as would many soldiers, officers, and citizens nationwide, giving insight into the thought process of a young soldier in respect to his so-called enemy. Osceola was born into a humble life in the Creek nation of Alabama, with no hereditary connection to the Seminoles. Upon relocating to Florida, he ascended to an unequaled position. He won a string of battles during the summer and fall of 1836, outmaneuvering and baffling U.S. troops in swamps and hammocks. He gave the Seminoles tribal identity and unified them in pursuit of a common goal. Osceola, as Townsend began to show, deconstructs the notion that all whites viewed Indians as savages. They gave respect where it was due, acknowledged valiance when it was displayed, and felt honored in his presence, regardless of his physical appearance or enemy status. Officers chose to deal with him in diplomatic consultations, and, upon his death on January 30, 1838, he was given a military funeral at Fort Moultrie. It is said that warriors and U.S. Soldiers alike wept at the news. The epitaphs at his gravesite read Patriot and Warrior, and so remains his legacy in U.S. History."],"display_date":"December 21, 1837","search_date":"1837-12-21","locations":[{"id":1503,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MOSQUITO, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2207,"title":"Fighting in the Schoolyard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-01-10","end_date":"1873-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The schoolyard of the Colored Academy at Pine River was alive with excitement on the afternoon of the tenth of January, 1873. George Green, a sturdy young man of around eighteen years, attempted to kiss the little bronze beauty Roberta. When Professor Thomas Henaforth discovered what had transpired outside of his school, he set out to punish the mischievous youth. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Professor found Green and hit him over the head with a heavy cudgel, inflicting several open, bleeding wounds. The battle seemed to be a clear victory for the Professor until later that day when Green attacked him as he exited the building. Green triumphed in this round, beating Professor Henaforth until he yelled Nuff.","R. E. Porter, the Staunton Spectator's editor, drew four conclusions from this incident. Young darkies should take care in their efforts to kiss girls at school, as only the professors may claim this benefit. Schoolteachers should mind how they try to discipline the older male students since the stronger will win out in the battle. Women are responsible for all disobedience as they lead others into temptation. Finally, Porter suggested that if it had been a white professor assaulting a black student the incident would have gained much greater publicity, but since it occurred among individuals of the same race, it is not as notable."," Implicated in this incident are the state of the school systems in the Reconstruction South and the quality and character of race relations. The historian Eric Foner describes how public education collapsed during the Reconstruction as a result of widespread tax cuts, sinking to the point that a state governor considered it a luxury. Black students endured the worst of this educational ruin, but their situation was markedly better than it had been during slavery when education was altogether forbidden. The difference in the quality of education and the creation of a Colored Academy to separate the races revealed the tension between the black and white populations. The language used by Porter to describe those involved in the fight supports Foner's argument for the beginnings of the system of racial subordination, especially in Porter's description of Green as the brawny young Buck whose muscles have been developed at the plough handle and the anvil.

On a Saturday evening Elzy Middlebrook was arguing with Thomas Brown outside the house of Wilson Goings, the father of Middlebrook's wife. Middlebrook accused Brown of being overly familiar with his wife, showing jealousy to be the source of the conflict that emerged. Wilson Goings, after listening to the quarrel outside his home, asked Brown inside. Middlebrook's wife was in the house and when Middlebrook was denied entry to the residence he became furious and tried to force his way inside. He managed to open the door enough to fire his pistol and hit Goings, resulting in a severe arm wound. Middlebrook then made his way to another door, gained entrance, and fatally wounded Brown.","   Elzy Middlebrook was arrested on Sunday morning without any attempt at escape. He was indicted on Monday for murder and malicious maiming, all a result of his suspicious love for his wife, barely mentioned throughout the article. The Valley Virginian specifically indicates that all of the parties involved [were] colored.","   The newspaper's report on the race of the individuals involved in the crime is essential to understanding its significance. It is an assertion that violent actions of this sort occur only within a certain set of people, implying that white Americans could rise above such crimes of passions. While under slavery Middlebrook was obliged to accept his wife's sexual contact with men other than himself due to his subservience under his master, his new freedom granted him the liberty to defend what he believed should be rightfully his. The wife becomes a question of property, evident in her absence in the reporting of the incident, and Middlebrook had a right to his property. Steven Hahn contends that the South following the Civil War was formed out of black struggles such as this one, illustrating the nature and complexity of race relations in the nineteenth century. The racial identification is indication of a level of racial prejudice, but the Middlebrook's indictment and trial indicate the due process of law given to every criminal regardless of race.

On September 19, 1856, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> reported a peculiar incident involving a Northerner who had made his way South. The captain of ship from Maine docked his ship in the port at Alexandria, Virginia. Upon hearing the results of the election in his home state, the captain hurrahing as he went had [his ship] hauled out into the middle of the Potomac, let go her anchor, ran up his bunting and fired his guns all night in honor of his home. The sailor boisterously put forth his pride in the Abolitionist outcomes of the elections in his free home state for all his Virginia hosts to see."," The <em>Tribune </em>also reported on the coverage the occurrence received in the local <em>Alexandria Gazette</em>. The <em>Gazette</em> claimed the sailor's actions proved an insult to the great state of Virginia. The Northern paper proceeded to attack the <em>Gazette</em> for its indignation of the captain's actions by saying, The dignity of the honorable states of Virginia and Maryland is insulted by the infernal noise of a half-mad sailor glorifying over the elections of Abolitionists in Maine Poor <em>Gazette</em>, it don't understand that the heart of a sailor...beats rapidly at the sound of oppression, and always rejoices when the right is the victor "," The <em>Tribune</em> berated the Southerners attack on the half-mad sailor as pathetic and unnecessary. However, for those living in the South, any influx of Abolitionist rhetoric had to be viewed as a threat. As William Link contests, in the years directly before Secession, slaveholders had to constantly protect the institution of slavery from ideological threats, both from within the social system of the South and from the invasion of radical antislavery Northerners. While to the journalists from Chicago, the actions of the captain could simply be viewed as the patriotic expression of a free spirited man of the sea, to those in Alexandria, anxious to protect their way of life based on slavery, the actions of a man celebrating the victories of abolitionists, had to be viewed as a threat. Even if the election took place in the far-away cold North of Maine, any victory for abolitionism was a loss for the cause of defending slavery."],"display_date":"September 19, 1856 - December 31, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-09","locations":[{"id":14383,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALEXANDRIA CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2258,"title":"Southern Religion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-11-13","end_date":"1865-11-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an attempt to legitimatize the institution of slavery, many white slave owners sought justification for their dominating actions within the Bible. They believed they had found it in the Old Testament with the Curse of Ham in Genesis 9:25-27. Cursed be Canaan The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers...Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem May Canaan be the slave of Shem. These southerners believed that Canaan had settled in Africa, and that his descendants had become black. Thus, slavery was the natural order of life, and because of this belief, many people were alarmed at the growing number of new religions preaching equality among the races. In the mid 1800s, Evangelicalism began in small groups and then began to gain its foothold in the South where it eventually formed several denominations (Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterian). The Methodists emerged out of these groups as staunch believers that slavery was wrong, and this ideal held well into the nineteenth century. "," Methodism was founded by John Wesley of New England, and was based on a premise that there was a method of coming to God. It quickly spread throughout the entire new world, particularly the South, where classes were conducted where people shared their innermost feelings with each other. In these classes, traditional boundaries of class, race, and sex were bridged. The Methodist preachers (along with the other Evangelical religions' preachers) began to travel throughout the South exclaiming the word of God. The Methodists, as well as other Evangelicals, became the enemy of the southern slave owners because of their anti-slavery stance, as well as their belief that women and African Americans were equal to white men. Slave owners felt that if the slaves internalized these ideals of freedom and equality, there would be a greater risk of slave revolts and general discontent within the system of bondage."," Leading up to and during the Civil War, many Methodists used their religious beliefs as justification for desiring to beat the Confederacy. When the Union won the war, and the slaves were emancipated, religious newspapers exclaimed about the Christianization of African Americans across the country. In a letter dated November 13, 1865, from Reverend W.H. Watkins in Washington, Mississippi, to the Philadelphia newspaper The Christian Recorder, Watkins told of the desire of the Methodist Church to educate African Americans in the teachings of Christ. He stated, It is the purpose of the Church, to whom the colored people are mainly indebted for all they know of Christianity, to supply the missions as formerly, where our ministry is desired, and where the people show a willingness to support it...We have shown ourselves friend of the Negro, and the Church will not abate any of its efforts to teach him the way of salvation...The Mississippi Conference resolves to promote the education of the rising generation. "," Methodists like Reverend Watkins still desired to promote Christ in the lives of African Americans throughout the South after the Civil War. They felt it was necessary to keep promoting the ideals of equality among all Americans, especially after emancipation. Because the nation had lived with such an unjust institution for so long, they knew these feelings of social inequality would not disappear overnight, and therefore resolved to try to dissolve them."],"display_date":"November 13, 1865","search_date":"1865-11-13","locations":[{"id":7319,"lat":33.2603630837,"lng":-90.841504364,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2264,"title":"Attack of Mrs. Yeakle and Lynching of John H.

Lynching occurred over whipping and beating when the social order of white society was attacked. The example Brundage uses to support this is the assault of a white woman. Bigus' case shows how such an act would not be permitted. The perpetrator of the act was in question. Three different men were implicated throughout the ordeal: George Parish, John H.

His master, along with other planters, sent their slaves, including Northup, south to St. Mary's Parish to hire themselves out on the sugar plantations where labor was needed and wages were high. Northup was hired out to a Judge Turner who lived on the Bayou Salle. After being given several different tasks, Northup was put in the sugarhouse. He acted in the capacity of driver; he was given a whip and told to use it on anyone who was idle. If he failed to do so, he would be whipped himself. The process of sugar making continued day and night; Northup had no regular times to rest and got little sleep. ","One advantage to working in the sugarhouse was that Northup was paid for some of his work. Louisiana custom mandated that a slave retain whatever compensation he may obtain for services performed on Sundays; this money allowed him to buy necessary articles such as utensils to cook with. To ask for these seemingly everyday and inconsequential things would have ended in laughter, a kick, or even a whipping from the master according to Northup's autobriography, <em>Twelve Years A Slave. Narrative Of Solomon Northup.</em> In the book, Northup also points out that however injurious to the morals, it [was] certainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave, to be permitted to break the Sabbath and be able to purchase everyday items. Northup earned 10 in Sabbath money. He added to this by playing his violin at a party given by one of Judge Turner's neighbors. He ended up with 17, which he took great pleasure in counting. He would spend his time dreaming of the water pails, pocket knives, new shoes and coats and hats and other everyday items that he would be able to buy. He also took great pleasure in being the wealthiest slave on the Bayou Boeuf when he returned home in January of 1846."," On a sugar plantation, such as Northup worked on, labor was almost continuous. Planting began in January and ended in March; cultivation began in March and lasted till July. Farm chores were done until grinding began in October. During the grinding season a mill would run almost nonstop from early Monday morning until noon on Saturday. It required work and constant supervision, and those chosen both to accomplish and oversee the task, like Northup, got little to no rest. Sometimes slaves were even required to work on the Sabbath, but, as in the case of Northup, slaves were usually paid for the work they did on this day usually reserved for rest. ","Throughout the South, planters of all types of crops often hired slaves from other plantations to provide extra help. Slaves' owners, as in Northup's case, sometimes hired out their slaves to other planters; in this situation the slave's master would usually take at least some of the money the slave earned in the job. Slave owners also found it profitable to hire slaves out to industry, such the lumber industry, or to the state for public works projects. Sometimes slaves were able to hire themselves out, meaning they could keep their own earnings. After the slave received his or her money, then that slave was free to spend it. Slaves often spent what little money they were able to make on providing themselves and their families with extra food and clothing. They could also buy small luxuries such as furniture.","Northup had not grown up having to spend endless hours working fervently in a hot sugar-grinding mill, nor did he grow up having to work on Sundays or play his violin at parties just to earn money to buy the few necessities of life. Northup had been born a free man but was kidnapped in 1841 while visiting Washington, D.C. He was drugged, threatened with death, and then put on a boat to New Orleans where a slave dealer sold him into slavery. His story, though unusual, was not unique. Not all African Americans sold in the slave yards were born into slavery; some where free men and women who had been kidnapped and sold South where they would be unable to escape or solicit help. Free African Americans were kidnapped from all over the United States in the nineteenth century. They were kidnapped from within the South. Three generations from one free African American family were kidnapped from Point Coupee, Louisiana, and sold in New Orleans. They were kidnapped in the Midwest; a free African American named John Merry from Illinois was arrested in St. Louis and sold in New Orleans. Northup himself was from New York in the North. Some of these kidnapped men, including both Northup and Merry, were able to get friends from the North to help them win back their freedom, but others did not always have friends who could help. Whether or not they were able to escape, they had to grow accustomed, for at least a little while, to being a piece of property who had been bought and paid for and who had to struggle though long hours of hard work for which they usually received no pay."],"display_date":"1845 - 1846","search_date":"1845-12-31","locations":[{"id":5713,"lat":29.8296521317,"lng":-91.9512085468,"zoom":9,"place":"ST MARY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2290,"title":"The Murder of Mrs. Harris \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-12-25","end_date":"1854-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["n the day of the murder, Ben Small kept watch in the yard for Isidore. Isidore knew that Mrs. Henry would never let Small in the house, so he had to commit the crime. After the murder, one of the men set fire to the house. Ben worried about the children who were asleep in the house at the time. ","This won't do, the children will be burned; let us wake them or put the fire out, Small reportedly said. ","No, Isidore replied. So much the worse for them. Let them burn, they will tell no tales. ","H.B. Trist of Bowden Plantation wrote to his daughter Willie in New Orleans on Christmas Day, telling her of the incident. Small had confessed to being an accomplice in the premeditated murder of Isidore's white mistress Mrs. Henry, and Trist's account of the murder came from the confession. This accounts, perhaps, for the story of Small's attempt at heroism when he reportedly wanted to save the children; it is possible that Small lied in order to save his own neck. It is unlikely he was capable of much heroism as he was also mixed up in the murder of two white whiskey sellers in the area. It is unclear if Small was a slave on the Marchand plantation or another plantation or if he was a free man. ","Trist found Isidore's betrayal of his mistress with whom he had grown up the most disturbing part of the confession. He thought that since Isidore had been raised together with Mrs. Harris and since she had always been kind to him this made his villainy even worse than Small's. ","In expressing his distress that Isidore could murder a woman whom he had grown up with and who had apparently always been kind to him, Trist was showing that he, like slaveholders throughout the South, subscribed to the doctrine of paternalism. Paternalism was a defense of slavery in which slaveholders claimed that they treated their slaves well and took care of them by providing them with food, clothing lodging, and religion. Slaveholders thought slavery to be a type of parent/child relationship where the slaveholder took care of the slave and the slave was grateful and content to be looked after. ","But Mrs. Harris' murder shows an instance where African Americans were obviously not content and thus showed an active resistance to their enslavement. According to historian Kenneth Stampp, slaves thought of their enslavement in terms of labor extortion and a lack of control over their own time and labor. They would play along with the slaveholder's illusions that they as slaves were helpless, because not to do so might anger their owner and end in some form of punishment by the owner. Slaves struggled against their forced servitude in many ways. Some were careless in their work. Some slaves sabotaged themselves to make themselves unfit for work. Stampp reports on one Kentucky slave who would purposely make himself sick by overdosing on medicines he found in his master's medicine chest. One of the more extreme steps a slave could take to resist enslavement was to run away. This was a dangerous step; runaway slaves usually were caught and brought back to the plantations where they were usually publicly punished as a warning to other potential runaways. A most extreme form of resistance was murder. Slaves murdered both overseers and owners for different reasons. Usually it was because the slave felt he had been treated badly or punished unfairly. According to Stampp, violence was usually only adopted by the most extremely discontented of the slaves. Many states had Black Codes to deal with slave violence. Louisiana's Black Code ordered that a slave be given a trial; if convicted, the slave was either sent to prison or, as was most common in the South, executed.

Someone heard Kerling's yells and Burley was handed over to police officer Trainor, who took her to the police station. She then awaited a hearing.","Although Louisa Kerling is not specifically called white, it can be assumed by the fact that in the newspaper, Elizabeth Burley's color was identified while Louisa Kerling's was not. The arrest of Burley, a relatively young girl, for fighting with and stealing the small sum of fifteen cents from Kerling, seems an overreaction. Historian Edward Ayers says that whites believed blacks held white law in contempt and that black crime was on the rise. In the late eighties, arrests and sentences of black men went up. Not only did whites perpetuate the belief of the dangerous black man but so did newspapers. Although Burley was young and a girl, this does not mean she would not be implicated in the increasing suspicion and fear of blacks. While the reaction to Burley's theft may be explained by a heightened fear of blacks committing crimes, it may also simply be a normal reaction to stealing.","The Sun published other articles of thievery in January of 1878.

According to a New York <em>Times</em> article, the girl, whose father bought her freedom after escaping to Boston, was a real, 'Ida May,'- a young female slave, so white as to defy the acutest judge to detect in her features, complexion, hair, or general appearance, the slightest trace of negro blood. "," Along her route to Boston from Alexandria, the child was shown to prominent individuals andreceived first class passage on her journey. All in all, people were astonished that this girl had ever been a slave, as she was possibly the fairest person they have ever seen."," The amazement felt by many upon seeing the young girl derives from what many historians feel is the true basis of slavery: the question of race. Walter Johnson contends that the question of race and its relation to slavery is one of the most important questions in American history, as some argue slavery was derived from the notion of race and the culturally based bias against blackness. Additionally he states that a desire among whites to dictate the fate of 'heathen' Africans provided the moral basis for the unmitigated exploitation that characterized the Atlantic slave trade and American slavery. Upon seeing a person of African American descent, white Southerners were forced to at least somewhat question the racial basis for their institution of slavery. If their superiority derived from their whiteness and their slaves' inferiority from their blackness, what does the presence of a fair skinned former slave mean for the institution of slavery? In his work, Johnson expresses the belief that southern slave-owners affirmed their whiteness by owning someone who was starkly contrasting racially. But, the presence of a white slave could potentially cause them to question the basis for their institution."],"display_date":"March 9, 1855","search_date":"1855-03-09","locations":[{"id":14383,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALEXANDRIA CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2313,"title":"African Americans Drinking during Church Service\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-01","end_date":"1846-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The white population of Culpeper County, Virginia was dismayed when their church services were inexcusably disrupted by the boisterous activities of some African Americans.

While it was already illegal to sell alcohol to slaves, the residents of Culpeper apparently were having trouble enforcing the law.

Melvin Ely conveys this sentiment when he states that whites felt blacks could only live in a civilized society if they were watched over and guided by the moral superiority of whites. Therefore, it was up to the white citizens of Culpeper County to curtail the economic activity that encouraged the disorderly conduct and upsetting the balance that so delicately permeated life in slave holding society. The conduct of the slaves in drunkenly disturbing the worship service reveals that the white residents of the county did not have as much control over the behavior of the black members of the community as they might have wanted to believe.

Many went to the free states of Ohio or Pennsylvania. However, several petitions made by the residents of Loudoun County reveal that the newly freed blacks were often inclined to stay in Virginia. As the petitions disclose, they received both support and some resistance from their neighbors in Loudoun County.","In 1848, thirty-nine petitioners requested the help of the state legislature in permitting William Watson to remain in Virginia. Watson had been emancipated by his owner and had proved a man of good character, of industrious habits, charged with the support of large family. Additionally, the petition stated that Watson was a convenient and useful person to [the] community in the capacity of a day laborer. A similar petition, signed by 93 residents, was written in Leesburg in 1850, requesting that Harriet Cook, a free black, be permitted to live in the state. The document stated that she possessed a high character and was a valuable member of Society. The petitioners elaborated on her value to their lives when they explained that she provided laundry services to many in the town and her loss would be a great inconvenience.","Despite these petitions, not every citizen in Loudoun County supported the residence of William Watson and Harriet Cook. A 1850 petition asked that the two free blacks be removed from the county and that the law should serve as the remedy in such cases where it ought to be in the city and county courts. Twelve residents of the county put petition. As pointed out by the historian Joshua Rothman, Virginia law required free blacks emancipated after 1806 to leave the state permanently within one year of manumission, unless they received a petition from the state legislature. While some fought to keep their families together and retain the already mangled pieces of their lives, Rothman states others made the difficult move and left a state that didn't want them anymore. That didn't want them while they were free. As the above-mentioned petitions demonstrate, some freed slaves received help from their white neighbors in their fight to stay in the state. This situation reveals, that in race relations, whites did not act like whites were supposed to act and blacks did not act like blacks were supposed to act, when personal relationships complicated the idea of stark racial divides.

Travelers relied on local people along these western routes to help provide them with necessary equipment and foodstuffs they needed on their journeys. Looking to capitalize on the growing market, Fleming Wood and his partner Egbert Harris hoped to establish a trading post in the area bordering the boundary line between the military base of Fort Smith, Arkansas and the Choctaw tribe of the Cherokee Nation. "," However, volatile relations that existed in Arkansas and throughout the South between whites and Native Americans stood in the way of simple establishment of a trading post. This was largely from exploitation felt by the Native Americans forced onto reservations and the cultural devastation caused by the white trade of vices such as alcohol. To help ameliorate these problems, the U.S. government created intercourse laws to regulate trade among the two groups. To work within these laws, Wood and Harris enlisted the help of M. Stokes, a lawyer for the Cherokee Nation; with his help, the traders obtained a trading license. "," Yet their luck as traders turned on September 9, 1837. Captain William Armstrong, the acting supervisor of the Western Territory, revoked their license and claimed that the traders had become among the largest whiskey dealers on the line. Though legalized sale of alcohol in Arkansas to whites was commonplace, the spirits sold by Wood and Harris' in their trading post broke the intercourse law because it created direct mercantile competition with the Cherokee Nation. In the interests of both governments, Armstrong also ordered his men to seize remaining goods in the post in order to keep the Indians from visiting the line as much as possible, [and] to prevent the introduction of liquor into the Indian country, and other violations of law. "," Angered by their loss of property and sales in the post, on December 12, 1838, Wood and Harris appealed the revocation of their license. The already volatile relations between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation intensified. Almost simultaneous with the appeal, U.S. government officials forced Cherokees off tribal lands during the Trail of Tears. Years of abuse, killing and enslavement of Native American populations ensued, and created juxtaposition to events in the Fleming Woods case that occurred over the course of the next three years. The Cherokee Nation, U.S. government, and the two traders discussed the issue of licensure and seizure of goods in a major review of the Indian Affairs policies. A turning point in U.S. governmental policy, the Fleming Woods case forced U.S. officials to recognize a greater Native American autonomy even in the face of their actions in forced relocation.

Mitchill was the executive chair of Georgia in 1817, but in early March of that year, he resigned his post. In July of that year, he met with the leaders of the Creek Nation at Fort Hawkins. His goal of this meeting was to explain to the Indians their role in creating and maintaining a mutual peace between the Indians and the United States. He warned the Creeks that other Americans had approached some of the Creeks in the southern portion of the nation, misleading them and bribing them away from the rest of their nation. He named, most notably, the British Agent Colonel Nichols, and cited the gifts given to some of these Creeks as evidence of corruption. Mitchill argued that the northern Creeks had a duty to bring those who had been led astray back into the nation, as tensions were slowly but steadily arising between them and the United States. Mitchill also stated that the United States would fulfill all of their promises to the Creek nation, as well as willingly renewing diplomatic relations with all of the southern Creeks who could be persuaded by their northern counterparts to return their previous amicable relations with the United States. In his testimony to the United States Senate on the First Seminole War, Mitchell did not state the final results of these talks; he implied, however, that the Creeks acquiesced to his requests. On August 4, 1817, Major Twiggs, stationed at Fort Scott, Georgia, wrote Mitchill on behalf of the chiefs of three Seminole towns in Florida. These three chiefs, via Major Twiggs, asked Mitchill if they too might agree to the terms he offered to the Creeks at Fort Hawkins. Mitchill planned to send for these three men, one of whom was Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town, to discuss their request. Before he could, however, General Gaines attacked and burned Fowl Town, thus instigating the violent retaliatory attacks of the Seminoles against the whites in the area that would mark the commencement of the First Seminole War and prompt Secretary of War Calhoun to dispatch General Andrew Jackson to Fort Scott.","One of the major problems in the process of creating and signing treaties between the United States and the Indians before 1830, when the Indian Removal Act was passed, was a lack of a central, sole authority for either side. The United States had multiple people, ranging from military officials like General Andrew Jackson to statesmen like Mitchell to independent citizens making a variety of agreements with the Indians. The Indians as well, and the Seminoles in particular, lacked a central government. Each town or group of Seminoles was organized independently, thus making it nearly impossible for the government of the United States to make a universal treaty. In addition, even if the United States succeed in writing and passing a treaty with a number of Indian leaders, as it did with the Chickasaws in Mississippi, that did not necessarily protect the tribe from the intervention of the state in which it lived. In the case of the Chickasaws, Mississippi tried to extra-legally subvert the treaty signed by the United States and the Chickasaws in 1830 in order to impose state law onto the Indians. Upon receiving a plea from the Chickasaws, President Jackson paid them a visit, and told them that they essentially had no choice but to sign a new treaty with the United States agreeing to be relocated west of the Mississippi River. The United States repeatedly recanted on previous treaties it had made with numerous different tribes in order to advance its own territorial possessions.

She claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Peter McQueen, an Indian prophet whom the United States Army had been pursuing for some time. General Jackson had recently just narrowly missed capturing his at Natural Bridge. As per his quick temper, the general was enraged. This Seminole woman presumably heard through word of mouth-there were some Indians serving under General Jackson's command-about his near miss. She offered to turn McQueen over to the United States in return for General Jackson to allow her people to be transported to the land of the upper Creeks, with sufficient provisions to tide them over until they could establish themselves agriculturally. In his furor, Jackson readily agreed to this pact, and she departed with a letter to the commanding officer of Fort St. Marks detailing the agreement. This was, however, the last recorded sighting of her. She never upheld her end of the bargain, nor did she seek further assistance from General Jackson in the relocation of her people. McQueen was, indeed, never captured.","The Seminoles, including the unnamed woman, were directly related to the Creeks. They were in fact originally members of the Creek confederacy in Alabama and Georgia. They migrated to Florida, however, in three distinct phases. In the first half of the eighteenth century, they executed small invasions of Spanish territory, but with the intent to raid white villages, rather than to establish settlements of their own. In the second half of the century, they began establishing villages; by 1812, the Seminoles inhabited at least six towns in Spanish Florida. From 1812 to 1820, the political and cultural tensions in Georgia and Alabama led many Creeks to move to Florida and join the Seminoles already living there. So when the Seminole woman asked General Jackson to help her people move back to the upper Creek nation, she was not asking for him to help her people invade another tribe's land. She was just asking to go home.","This incident is also a clear indication of the growing power of Seminole women. From 1812 to 1820, they experienced a significant increase in their ability to exist formally outside of the household. With the migration of Seminoles to Florida, they came increasingly into contact with whites, allowing them to enter into small trade with them. These agricultural business transactions-primarily involving Seminole women growing and selling oranges, melons, corn, rice, and peaches to whites-greatly increased the political legitimacy of these women, thereby giving the unnamed woman the authority to strike her deal with a general in the United States Army."],"display_date":"April 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-04-18","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2332,"title":"Spanish Duplicity Exposed at Fort St. Marks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-05-01","end_date":"1818-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Fort St. Marks was a Spanish-occupied fort in Florida, but by early May of 1818, the Spanish were, in the opinion of United States General Andrew Jackson, rapidly losing their ability to control it and, as a result, it was vulnerable to changing hands to the Seminoles'. As the end of the First Seminole War was in sight, this was not something General Jackson could allow to happen. So he approached the commander of Fort St. Marks and asked for his surrender to the United States instead of passing the fort on to Seminole control at the end of the war. Despite extensive negotiations, the Spanish commander decided to turn the fort over to the Indians, much to General Jackson's dismay. He refused to passively accept this outcome, however, and invaded the fort, replacing the Spanish flag with that of the United States without any resistance from the Spaniards. ","Part of General Jackson's animosity and distrust towards the Spanish was proven by the discovery of documents in the fort that detailed the transfer of arms and ammunition to the Seminoles. It was these arms that were used against his soldiers and the citizens of his country. The alliance between the Spanish and the Florida Seminoles was no secret, but the capture of Fort St. Marks provided concrete evidence as to this alliance. In addition to these documents, the American troops also found evidence that the Indians had been in the fort and that the chief of the Seminoles had met with the Spanish leaders in the private quarters of the commanding officer of the fort. There were goods clearly received via trade with the Seminoles stockpiled, including some that the Indians had stolen from American settlers. General Jackson subsequently blamed the Spanish for perpetuating the conflict between the Americans and the Indians in Florida. ","Prior to this discovery, however, both the Spanish and the United States maintained a public facade of being in a war together against the Seminoles, and the Spanish commanders in Florida denied giving any aid to the Seminoles in letter correspondence with American officers. In reality, the Seminoles had been allied with the Spanish since 1812, when the Spanish governor sent messages to the Seminole chiefs claiming that the United States would commandeer their land if they allied with it. He also offered a 1,000 reward for the scalp of John McIntosh, an Indian officer in the United States Army, and a 10 reward for one of any other United States-allied soldier or Indian."],"display_date":"May 1, 1818 - May 30, 1818","search_date":"1818-05-15","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2333,"title":"A Defense of General Jackson&#39;s Invasion of Pensacola\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-04-19","end_date":"1819-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Upon hearing rumors that the Seminoles were gathering en masse in Pensacola, Florida, General Andrew Jackson and his army invaded and took control of the town, dispersing the Seminole gathering in the process.

","In the face of this firestorm of words, <em>The Times</em> published an article from the National Intelligencer defending General Jackson's actions. This article, the goal of which was to explain General Jackson's logic in deciding to attack Pensacola to the public, was rife with what today would be understood as racist attitudes. If it [the seizure and occupation of Pensacola] saved the life of a single frontier settler, it was right. At the time, however, these attitudes represented one side of the norm. Indians were killing whites. Indians were in possession of valuable land. Indeed, it was their own economic prosperity in their trade with the British that attracted the attention and ultimate envy of the United States. Given these two facts, many Americans believed the U.S. Government had every right to relocate them to the west.","The other side of this debate, which emerged about a decade later during the firestorm surrounding the passage and implementation of the Indian Removal Act, was adamantly opposed to the removal of the Indians, regardless of the rationale behind it.

As 1823 turned to 1824, Neamathla was the head chief of the Seminole Nation. This would not last, however. By July, he had been removed by the United States because of growing tension between him and the governor of the Florida territory, William Duval. The Seminoles were now faced with the challenge of electing a new leader who would represent them well without inciting the anger of the United States.","There were two candidates going into the election. Micopany was the candidate favored by the Seminoles, while the Tallahassees and the Micasukies favored Tuko-see-mathly, also known as John Hicks. The election went off without a hitch, and John Hicks was elected as the new head chief of the Seminole Nation-a political union of the Seminoles, Micasukies, and Tallahassees. ","This nation would not last, however. Within a decade, the Seminoles would again be embroiled in a war with the United States. Prior to this war, however, the United States had already begun making inroads on relocating the Seminoles. On September 18, 1823, the United States and the Seminoles signed the Moultrie Creek Treaty. The terms of this treaty moved the Seminoles south onto a reservation. This mass move of 2,300 Seminoles was poorly planned and poorly executed by the United States, primarily because of its lack of knowledge of the territory. The land upon which the Seminoles were settling was poor in quality, which did not bode well for the future health of the community. Indeed, they were hit with food shortages and starvation in both 1825 and 1827 when poor harvests left them without sufficient food to feed themselves. Naturally, they began roaming beyond the borders of their reservation in search of food. The United States, however, did not like this one bit. It had put the Seminoles on a reservation for a reason-so they would not interfere with the American settlers in the territory. So, in 1827, the United States passed a law forbidding the Seminoles from crossing the boundaries of their reservation.","This restriction, like the election a few years before, that seemed so significant at the time, hardly mattered in the long run.

First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2345,"title":"Sam Forwood&#39;s Definition of the Southern Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-05-07","end_date":"1840-05-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 7, 1840, Sam Forwood, in Clark County, Alabama, wrote to his son William on the health of his family. Numerous family letters focused on health. In this correspondence, the first paragraph tended to discuss the health of all members of the family and the history of any sicknesses since the last letter. The Forwood family was generally in sufficient health, despite a fever here and there. However, in this letter, Sam chose to include the conditions of his slaves. He wrote, My family is in good health except one negro woman and a little negro boy over two years old. The black woman had been plagued by a slight fever, and the young slave boy had broken a bone rough-housing with some of the other slave children. Following this mention, Sam continued his letter with the normal discussion of his cotton crop and other business around Clark County.","This is not an exception in the history of southern slavery. Slave owners often included slaves as a part of their household. As Edward Ayers points out, in most instances, masters and slaves mutually cared for one another, and masters would grieve for slaves as a member for the family. Because the idea of family was so important in the southern Christian culture, masters frequently included their slaves in their notion of their family unit. The inclusion would, in theory, civilize the slaves with Christian influences because slaves who respected their masters-as children who respect their fathers-would never seek to harm them. Furthermore, the slaves' own family units, like those of their masters, kept a degree of humanity and happiness instilled in the plantation dynamics.","Moreover, slaves were the livelihood of southern plantation owners, and thus owners were necessarily concerned about the health of their slaves. According to William Roger, slavery was an indispensable component of the cotton kingdom, and so, the success of an Alabama plantation and the success of its owner rested upon the slaves. Surely, a slave with a broken bone or a fever was of no use. Therefore, Sam Forwood had no choice but to care about the well-being of their slaves."],"display_date":"May 7, 1840","search_date":"1840-05-07","locations":[{"id":78,"lat":31.6767353507,"lng":-87.8307270777,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2349,"title":"The Cycle of Sharecropping\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-01-09","end_date":"1889-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Widowed and with few options available to support herself, Dolly Lang, a black widow living in Falls County, Texas, signed a sharecropping contract with Mrs. V.C. Billingsley on January 9, 1889. The contract specified that Lang agreed to lease around 48 acres of land previously rented by her husband Ellis Lang and on which she currently lived. The land was to be used for growing cotton. Consequently, the agreed upon rental price was the first three bales of cotton produced from the land each year, each having to weigh in at five hundred pounds. The lease agreement was stated to expire at the end of the year unless otherwise agreed to by Mrs. V.C. Billingsley.","Farm tenancy, the division of land to be rented and farmed by individuals, had been a practice in Texas since the colonial period; however, the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of slaves caused a boom in farm tenancy across the southeastern United States as the demand for both agricultural labor and employment skyrocketed. Initially, sharecropping seemed to be an excellent solution for both those with land and those without; yet eventually, it became evident that sharecropping created a dangerous cycle of debt and, at times, the abuse of power by the traditionally white landowner over the poor black and white sharecroppers. Sharecropping quickly became the most common farm tenant arrangement, one in which the tenant did not receive his or her payment, typically given as a share of the crops, until the crops were harvested and turned into the landowner. Through this system, the landowner still exercised a great degree of power, illustrated by the terms of Lang's contract.","Being a sharecropper was a risky business as many were left with no profit after paying back debts incurred during the growing season. This caused the sharecropper to start off the next growing season already indebted to merchants or the landowner and facing the additional challenge of an uphill battle against the unknowns of Mother Nature. Cotton was particularly popular for the high prices it fetched, yet it seeped all of the nutrients out of the soil starting a succession of diminishing returns. When this happened, sharecroppers frequently had to decrease their crop yield and were unable to seek out more fertile land as state laws mandated they remain on the property until they paid off their debts. Landowners and local merchants often took advantage of sharecroppers, many of whom were still illiterate, and maintained economic control. Indeed, because of the way in which sharecroppers were caught in a cycle of debt and were at the mercy of landowners, Claudine Ferrell refers to sharecropping as a form of economic slavery in her book <em>Reconstruction</em>.","While many poor white men also made a living as sharecroppers, a disproportionately high amount of blacks took part in the practice. Life as a tenant farmer was certainly not as grim as it had been for blacks living in slavery; black men and women technically had the ability to spend their time, money and energy as they so desired. Still, as Reconstruction came to a formal close in 1877, the plantation system remained firmly entrenched and many white landowners saw overseeing sharecroppers as a variation of the duties they had retained during slavery. The landowner maintained control over the individuals on his property and thus a relationship based on domination and vulnerability persisted between many blacks and whites in the South. Regardless of the inequity it perpetuated, sharecropping shaped the economic and social atmosphere of much of the agricultural South long after Reconstruction ended and on through the Depression."],"display_date":"January 9, 1889","search_date":"1889-01-09","locations":[{"id":12743,"lat":31.2532790477,"lng":-96.9358479777,"zoom":9,"place":"FALLS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2352,"title":"Fighting for Equality in the Public Sphere\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-08-25","end_date":"1898-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though Reconstruction ended officially in 1877, the country and its people were far from united as racism and segregation became a growing force. Texas, though on the edge of the South, was certainly no stranger to this battle over inequality. On November 18, 1898, the Galveston News ran an article detailing how Isabelle E. Mabson, a black resident of Galveston, TX, filed suit in the district court against the Missouri, Kansas and Texas railway company of Texas and the Wagner palace car company. The lawsuit was for a total of 1,800 in damages based on the fact that Mabson was denied the ability to ride in the first-class car based on her race. On August 25 of that year, Mabson had purchased first-class tickets to take herself and her children from Kansas City home to Galveston. She was able to ride in the first-class car until the train reached Denison, TX where she was ejected from the car by company officials because Mabson and her children were black. The fact that she was forced from the car in front of her fellow passengers caused her great embarrassment. She and her children were offered to ride in the car for black clients, which was cited as dirty and filled with filth of person and language. Mabson was sick at the time and desired the luxury provided by the first-class car, so she left the train and purchased tickets for the remainder of the journey through the Houston and Texas Central railway.","Isabella Mabson was among the first black women to take a stand for equal treatment in the public sphere by filing suit in federal district court. While the outcome of her case is not known, the article highlights the issues that blacks continued to face in Texas after Reconstruction ended. The Fifteenth Amendment passed in 1870, creating equal rights for all men despite race or color; however, women were not included in this amendment. While the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1875 encouraged many to fight public segregation, efforts were soon curtailed when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the section of that act pertaining to public accommodations unconstitutional. This act enabled states, including Texas, to pass Jim Crow laws at the state and local level which greatly constrained the rights of black men and women. Texas, along with other southern states, put into effect a great deal of laws restricting the day to day behaviors of black residents.","Southern history is full of accounts similar to that of Mabson. Frequently, black passengers would purchase tickets to ride in cars with more pleasant conditions only to be demanded by railroad officials to remove themselves immediately. If the black passenger did not comply, the situation could quickly escalate and at times even resulted in assault. In the 1880s and 90s, railway cars became the first site of state-mandated segregation laws in the South. After the Texas government created legislation for railway-car segregation, the practice of segregation in public settings expanded from there; while the frequency of segregation increased, so did racial tensions. As Edward Ayers emphasizes in his book <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, new generations of whites became squeamish about black people in ways their grandparents could never have imagined-- or afforded. Laws such as this were reaffirmed at the national level in 1896 when the U.S. Supreme Court gave its ruling in the case <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, in which it declared segregation was permitted under the separate but equal clause. In protest of this kind of segregation, blacks practiced civil disobedience and took legal actions such as the above case initiated by Mabson, while many others simply left and went further north in favor of areas such as Kansas which promised more equal treatment.

Finally two candidates had been selected-A.K. Davis was nominated for Lieutenant Governor, while James Hill was chosen to run for Secretary of State-and both men were African American.  This was a crucial decision for the Republican Party because each of these offices was extremely visible in the state of Mississippi.  Senator Alcorn, a prominent Mississippi politician, surprisingly declared that he was against the Republican ticket for reasons he did not immediately disclose.  He said that he would address the people of Mississippi the following evening at Representative Hall.  Upon dismissal of the session, the Republicans still had not decided who they would appoint to run for State Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Education.  ","       James Lusk Alcorn was elected as the first governor of the reconstructed state of Mississippi in 1969, and he later became a United States Senator.  Alcorn was an extremely wealthy white planter who had been against secession in 1861, and was elated when Mississippi rejoined the Union in 1969.  He was a huge proponent of African American involvement in politics; he wanted them to contribute ideas, candidates, and their votes as newly declared United States citizens.  There were many Mississippians, however, who were not complementary of this idea, a large number of them being Democrats.  Voicing the opinions of many Mississippians, one state newspaper claimed, Nigger voting, holding office and sitting in the jury box are all wrong, and against the sentiment of the country.  African Americans were often stereotyped as lazy, ignorant, and illiterate, and therefore totally incompetent as governing officials.  Alcorn became known as an enemy of the white race; his desires for racial legal equality were not only controversial, but the cause of intense hatred towards him.  ","       The resistance to change and the racist lens through which Mississippians tended to view politics made it difficult for a black man to hold office during Reconstruction.  The appointing of two black candidates for office in Mississippi, despite opposition, however, was not entirely uncommon.  When the remaining Radical Reconstruction governments were finally overthrown in 1877, approximately 2,000 African American men had held local, state, and federal public offices in the South, including a wide range of titles and duties.  This proves that the freedmen were able to overcome the obstacles that held them back and not only run for office, but frequently win the election.  Mississippi blacks who ran for office benefited from the fact that their state was over 50 percent African American in 1870; the concentration of African American populations made a major difference in the likelihood of election for black candidates.  A vast majority of the blacks who ran for public office in the lower South were on the Republican ticket, like A.K. Davis and James Hill.  These two pioneers of black political participation in Mississippi were among the many African Americans who fought for a voice in American Politics during the Reconstruction.

Horace Maynard, the Chairman of the Sub-Ku Klux Committee of Florida, faced a difficult predicament in late November of 1871.  The members of the Young Men's Democratic Club of Leon County, Florida, were in extreme state of alarm and this was brought to the committee chairman's attention.  They were worried about the recent outing of the Ku Klux division of their political club before the Committee-they were afraid of the consequences of their exposure.  Many members of the Democratic organization were planning to flee to Texas, fearing that the same fate might be in store for them that their South Carolina sympathizers experienced.  Republicans in Leon County were also concerned, since people blamed them for exposing the Ku Klux men's secret to the Committee.  The Chairman considered his responsibility to protect the Republicans of Leon County from Ku Klux persecution and likely put a plan for their safety underway.","       The Ku Klux Klan originally started in Tennessee, but infiltrated into bordering regions of Alabama in 1867 or so.  From there it quickly expanded into the state, forming dens that covered the entire former Confederacy by the end of 1868.  Members of the Klan came from all different economic and social levels, but they were united in that the vast majority of them were young men and almost all of them were in some way affiliated with the Democratic Party.  The Klan tended to thrive especially well in rural areas of the South, like Leon County in Florida.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Klan affiliations were found within the Young Men's Democratic Club of this county-the members were perfect candidates for Ku Klux recruitment.  ","      It is also predictable that the Klansmen were turned in by Republicans, who tended to be more in support of African American rights and less active on their inner racist beliefs than the Democrats.  The idea of running away to Texas to escape punishment was a common idea for those who needed to hide in the late nineteenth century, as well.  Texas was a brand new state and, because it was so rural, it provided a great hiding ground for criminals and refugees.  The Klansmen of the Democratic Party in Leon County most likely did run away to Texas for a while to escape the consequences of the revelation of their KKK affiliations.  Their experience shows that Klan membership was a common political faction within many sections of the Democratic Party and reveals the reaction to KKK involvement in post-bellum society."],"display_date":"November 24, 1871 - November 30, 1871","search_date":"1871-11-27","locations":[{"id":1397,"lat":30.4585161351,"lng":-84.2751559802,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2387,"title":"Angry Alabamians Protest Austrian&#39;s Governmental Position\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-11-12","end_date":"1881-11-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late 1881, writers for <em>The Mobile Register</em> were frustrated with the federal government, as were many citizens of the area. The newspaper's editor wrote that Strobach, an Austrian who had been appointed to oversee the Federal patronage of Alabama, should not be trusted to this office. The newspaper claimed that he came to the United States originally as hostler to Prince Salm-Salm. The writer adds, most likely as a suggestion to the President, that if the position is still available, Strobach ought to be blacking Arthur's boots, instead of naming men for Federal offices. Clearly Mobile citizens were not only uncomfortable with Strobach's appointed position, but they were angry and verbally hostile as well.","Mobile residents were not pleased with a foreign immigrant working in a government office that wielded power over their city. The prejudice against immigrants expressed in the local newspaper was not unusual in this time, nor has it been in any time in American history. In historical studies of American reactions towards foreign immigrants, sociologists have found that in the past there have been four primary stages of treatment towards the new Americans. First, people were curious about the new and different immigrants; next, they extended to them an economic welcome; the third stage was characterized by industrial and social antagonism; fourth, the Americans sought to harm the immigrants via legislation; in the fifth stage Americans displayed fair-play tendencies; finally, quiescence was achieved.","The influx of European immigrants in the nineteenth century undoubtedly triggered the onset of new forms of racism and cultural elitism, as evidenced by the Alabamians' attitudes towards the foreign official. Residents of the Gulf Coast would only have interacted with immigrants on an economic level, and therefore they were uncomfortable with Strobach's position of authority. Surprisingly, 18.7 percent of the mining work force in Alabama consisted of European immigrants. The Republicans of the state saw political advantages in importing laborers, whereas the Democrats wanted less dependence on black workers-thusly, immigration of Europeans was encouraged. However, the traditionally white-black dynamic in Alabama was not easily compatible with immigration influxes, resulting in racial and cultural stereotyping and discomfort. The Gulf Coast residents seemed to think that Strobach's European culture made him unfit for government duties, and they assumed his kind would be better suited for working low-pay jobs, like shoe-shining. Though seemingly cruel, the Mobile Register writers were simply displaying the discomfort that would have existed among a people who had only know immigrants in the capacity of mine and factory working. This stage of industrial and social antagonism is a natural phase of reaction to immigration, and the antagonism was most likely heightened by the South's already difficult race relation issues."],"display_date":"November 12, 1881","search_date":"1881-11-12","locations":[{"id":287,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2388,"title":"Diversity in the Houston Saturday Evening Market\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As the sun lay low in the evening sky, the Saturday market in Houston sprang to life with a diverse and vivid collection of venders and products. Lee Hardy described how the area was full of venders alone representing every nationality, Americans being far in the minority. Open from 5 PM to 10 PM in the summer, here German traders, who had often traveled more than twenty miles to be present, set up stands with their fresh produce. A negro market gardener offered turkeys, some ready to cook and others still alive. Hardy walked by a Chinese peddler, who displayed his hand-made creations including fans, teapots and brushes in front of him, while German and Irish women patrolled the rows of vegetable stands. Though the meat market was largely dominated by German butchers, along with a few French and Americans, Italian vendors were also present selling wild game such as squirrels, partridges and prairie-chickens. Black, white, brown, and yellow-- negroes, Americans, Mongolians, Irish, Dutch, French, Germans, Italians, and Spanish-- they are all there, laughing, talking, quarrelling, gesticulating, bargaining, gossiping, staring, keeping appointments and making new ones, being proper or improper, polite or rude, as the case may be, Hardy noted.","In the years leading up to and following the Civil War, Houston, like many cities throughout the South and the nation, experienced a large influx of immigrants. As a consequence, it acquired an increasingly diverse population. Individuals came from all over Europe due to various push and pull factors, including the search for land, freedom and the promise of a better life. Texas saw its population grow 173 percent between the years of 1870 and 1890; this was largely due to a migration of fellow southerners searching for relief from the ruin of other southern states coupled with German immigrants arriving in large numbers. As word spread in Europe of the promising land of the West, Germans quickly became one of the largest ethnic groups in Texas; some estimate that during the 1800s, the populations of Galveston and San Antonio were anywhere from one-third to one-half German.","Cities, especially those in the North, were receiving the bulk of immigrants in the 1890s and early 1900s; however, the crowded conditions, competitive job markets, and even government plans were often incentives for people to move out into more rural areas. Texas saw its population of German and Russian Jewish residents escalate greatly in the early 1900s due to the Galveston Immigration Plan. This program aimed to relieve the crowded conditions in the Jewish ghettos in cities by sending newly-arrived immigrants to be resettled in rural western areas and other interior states. In addition to Europeans, a new wave of Chinese immigrants came to the United States and the West in particular during this time period to work on railroad construction projects.","Post-war southern cities also saw a flood of newly-freed black citizens coming in off of the plantations in neighboring counties. While this caused the actual numbers of black residents to increase in many cities, Texas saw the amount of black residents as a proportion of its population actually decrease as they could not keep up with the rapid influx of white immigrants. Yet, despite the implementation of segregation laws and various forms of discrimination and racism, cities continued to see an increase in their black populations; harsh climate conditions and economic instability seen in the agricultural realm at the end of the 1800s drove people into the cities to find work and augmented the population swell, especially when work became available in the railroad and lumber industries. Despite its reputation as being a lily-white South, the region was actually the site of much diversity and many members of the various groups coexisted in a peaceful, mutually beneficial manner."],"display_date":1890,"search_date":"1890-07-02","locations":[{"id":12839,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2390,"title":"Interracial Shootout Leaves Two Dead\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-12-28","end_date":"1881-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Joel Johnson, a well-known citizen of Baldwin County, Alabama, was riding quietly along a public road near Sibley's Mill. Unexpectedly, an African American hiding behind a tree shot Johnson in the head, stunning him and throwing him from his horse. The black man then shot him twice more, first in the wrist and again in the side. Taking him for dead, the assailant dragged Johnson three-hundred yards to a nearby pond, dumping his body in the water. The African American then mounted Johnson's horse and rode off to a party in the neighborhood nearby. Unfortunately for the shooter, the night air somehow revived Joel Johnson and the injured man was able to drag himself back to his home, half a mile away. Johnson related the story to his brother, Abe, who happened to be the Baldwin County Deputy Sheriff. Abe Johnson heard reports that the black man had been seen on his brother's horse, so he set off to arrest the attacker. The sheriff found the man at Jim Malone's home, within the county, and when he tried to arrest the black man, he drew his pistol. Deputy Sheriff Johnson then shot him, whereupon the African American shot right back, the bullet piercing Abe Johnson's chest. The black man then ran, and the sheriff attempted to run after him, shooting once more. The shooter managed to escape, and Abe Johnson perished fifteen minutes later. The black assailant was found dead at four o'clock the following afternoon by onlookers who had developed a search party. He had been shot through the breast and the wrist, and had managed to run half a mile alongside a creek, until he fell into a swamp and died.","After emancipation and during the early years of Reconstruction, there were frequent instances of interracial violence in the South. Episodes like the Johnson men's encounter with a black criminal were especially common in rural areas of the South, where law enforcement in the tumultuous post-war atmosphere was particularly difficult. Some accounts of the Reconstruction years have emphasized the presence of black militiamen and created a false sense among Americans that blacks were out looking to start conflict with whites. There were some blacks who used theft or arson as a means of protest against white oppression, as the black thief in Baldwin County may have intended to, but this was not the norm. Rather, African Americans were usually trying to build new lives as freedmen, not avenge the masters of their pasts. In fact, most of the violence during Reconstruction came from bitter, defeated white Southerners who clung to their support of black enslavement. The concept of white supremacy versus black criminality and inferiority was pervasive in regions like the Gulf Coast. A large Southern crime wave in the late nineteenth century contributed to the tumultuous racial climate, causing an increase in the frequency of lynchings and other forms of interracial violence. Since there were so many African Americans in jails, whites felt there was no doubt that blacks were responsible for the increase in crime rate. This justification further added to the number of violent encounters between the races, such as the shootout between the Johnson brothers and their black assailant. It would be a long time and a difficult struggle before race relations would settle down, and therefore violence between African and white Americans was inevitable in areas like southern Alabama."],"display_date":"December 28, 1881","search_date":"1881-12-28","locations":[{"id":16,"lat":30.2786488602,"lng":-87.5482936023,"zoom":9,"place":"BALDWIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2392,"title":"Texas Homestead Law and the Economic Depression of the 1890s\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1891-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From her ranch in Texas, Jane Maverick wrote that the early 1890s were sad years for families throughout the nation as the country was undergoing an economic depression.

When financial difficulties set in, her husband lost all of his land except for their house. All went but the big stone house, which that blessed homestead law of Texas saved, she wrote.","The Texas Homestead Law was based on a concept of exempting a house from seizure by creditors, and it originated in Texas in the early 1800s. Permanently established in the state's constitution in 1845, the law protected citizens from losing their houses to foreclosure due to debt which occurred frequently, especially for farmers, during the economic instability following Reconstruction. The Constitution of 1869 defined the rural homestead that was exempt as being less than 200 acres while an eligible urban homestead was viewed as a house worth less than 5,000. The Homestead law did not protect debtors who owed their money to the federal government.","The Homestead law saved many families, in addition to the Mavericks, from becoming homeless when economic hardships took their toll on the country. After the Civil War ended, the United States entered into a period of economic turbulence. This period was marked by great gain but also by the Panic of 1873, strikes by organized labor groups, and falling agricultural prices; all of these factors culminated in the economic depression of the 1890s. Nationally, economic problems are pinpointed as beginning in 1893 with conditions worsening through the rest of the year. Some recovery took place in 1898, but the economy was not fully restored until 1901 or 1902. This depression is considered to be the second only to the Great Depression in terms of severity. Perhaps hit hardest by the economic downfall were the southern and western states as 153 of the 158 national banks that failed during this period were in the South and West. During this time, the cotton textile industry was the only southern manufacturing industry to prosper. Farmers in this field still faced financial issues and the instability of cotton crops due to weather and fluctuating prices.","The economic hardships also exacerbated race relations in many areas. Poor white workers now frequently found themselves competing with blacks for the same jobs and for similarly low wages. This eroded the desired sense of white superiority and caused many bonds which had been formed across the color line to be strained or broken and increased distrust and feelings of ill will between the two groups. The economic depression manifested itself at economic, political, and personal levels across the country and led the country on slightly unsteady legs into the twentieth century."],"display_date":"1890 - 1891","search_date":"1890-12-31","locations":[{"id":12547,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"BEXAR, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2394,"title":"Public Education for African Americans in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-11-13","end_date":"1883-11-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of November 13, in Birmingham, Alabama, the United States Senate Sub-Committee on Education and Labor resumed session.

Next a black witness was asked to take the stand. James Hall, a wealthy African American planter, was summoned to Birmingham to give a testimony concerning the state of blacks in Mobile. James apprehensively approached the podium to make his speech, because what he had to report would please the committee, but it might arouse racist sentiments from his fellow Alabamians. He explained to the committee that he felt that the relations between blacks and whites in Mobile were improving at a steady rate, and he proudly shared that the children were attending school seven months out of the year.

Trail roads were rough, there were high rivers to cross, diseases to contend with, and of course the possibility of meeting up with Indians. Mary Maverick was making such a journey in the summer of 1837. She was traveling by wagon train from her home in Alabama to the new land of Texas. One day when her party was moving camp, 17 Tonkawa warriors surprised them. Still in war paint, the Indians greeted Maverick's party brandishing several pieces of human flesh. Maverick remembered the Indians coming up to her carriage and asking to see her baby. She denied the request and made sure to show the warriors her pistol and bowie knife. Maverick expressed annoyance when the 17 decided to ride along with the train instead of leave. The 17 Tonkawas did eventually quit the party much to the relief of Maverick. She was certain that had they gotten a hold of her baby, they would have eaten it. ","Meeting Indians was a regular occurrence as whites encroached more and more on tribal lands. The fear and aggravation Maverick experienced was common among settlers who encountered Indians. Maverick's fear that the Tonkawas might eat her baby was not completely unfounded. Tonkawa warriors did have a reputation for cannibalism. Accounts described warriors cutting off the hands and feet of their victims and then eating them. This, along with other obvious cultural differences and bad blood, made the two groups wary of each other. ","From the earliest days of Texas Stephen F. Austin anticipated conflict with Indians in the new settlements. In his first presidency (1836-1838), Sam Houston passed laws providing for frontier defense against both Mexicans and Indians. Houston wanted both protections for his people and to stay on friendly terms with Indian allies. There were, however, problems with the Indian land claims; the Texas government refused to recognize their legitimacy. When Mirabeau B. Lamar became the second president of the Republic of Texas in 1838, Indian tribes found him to be no friend of theirs. Lamar called for, an exterminating war on [Texas Indian] warriors; which will admit no compromise and have no termination except in their total extinction or total expulsion. Lamar wanted the Indians gone because he saw them as dangerous people and competitors for prime real estate. Lamar's attitudes mirrored those of the Texas people. Maverick was afraid of what the Tonkawas might do to her party and just wanted them to go away so that they could camp in peace.

Here he saw a settler arriving in Texas with a group of slaves. The large band of black enslaved men and women moved about without cares; they laughed and joke as they ate their biscuits. A man only identified as the entertainer of the group created comic relief when he whipped a donkey who in turn kicked the hind quarters of a very fat man. The slaves laughed uncontrollably, spewing out pieces of biscuit and some nearly choking because they were laughing so hard. ","As the train left the wharf, Sheridan could not help but pity the jovial slaves who were ignorant of what lay ahead of them. Go your ways, he wrote, go your ways my happy thoughtless party - happy because thoughtless, the time may not be far distant... when your quips & cranks will be turned into tears, wails & groans. Sheridan predicted the break up of the happy group as members would be sold as property to repay debts and satisfy the needs of their master.","Texas's close proximity to Louisiana and the New Orleans slave market, the largest in the country, made Sheridan's predictions viable. Walter Johnson poignantly describes the slave trade as, the story of separated lovers and broken families, of widows, widowers, and orphans left in the wake of the trade, only, perhaps, to be sold themselves at a later date. The interstate slave trade separated families and friends all the time; there was no reason to think it would be different for this group of slaves. Being sold to other slave owners was a fact of life for slaves, and Sheridan believed the thought of this should have sobered up the band of slaves and made them more serious and reserved. ","Like many other white people of this time, Sheridan depicted the band of slaves with condescension. There were conventional topics that white writers focused on when describing slaves: 'the skin, the odor, the dialect, the shuffle,' and even the endearing 'imbecile good nature.' Sheridan primarily focused on the nature of the black slaves; they were funny, loud, and grotesque. Sheridan could not look past these things and see the vibrant African American culture as a way for slaves to deal with their enslavement. Sheridan's entry shows that he had a good knowledge of the slave trade an the hardships slaves face, but that he was ignorant of black culture and how it related to their condition as slaves.

In the winter of 1879 Eleanor decided to visit her mother and family in Baltimore, Maryland for Christmas. She took with her, her daughter and Margaret Blake. Blake quickly caught a cold that grew into erysipelas. Mrs. McC. left her with her family in Baltimore expecting her to return to Chicago when she was well; however, the sickness grew worse and they sent her to the Baltimore Infirmary. She died there on March 10, 1880. Mrs. McC ordered her a headstone with her name and date of birth on it. Mrs. Walter B. B. requested the stone to read Faithful unto Death.The relationship between Margaret Jane Blake and the McC and Walter B. B. families existed during the period after Reconstruction when African Americans were exposed to greater freedom from the days of enslavement but also new forms of repression. As Edward Ayers describes, segregation existed but was not completely nor universally defined. There was heavy racism and separatism, but also advancements in the black community. Race relations were complex and varied; friendships and positive relations could exist while being entwined in race traditions. This environment allowed for a variety of race relations to exist, including ones like that of Margaret Blake and her employers. ","Just how positive or negative Margaret Blake's relationship was with her employers is unclear. She spent years with them, becoming a constant in their lives. While Mrs. Walter B.

The townsmen that entered requested that Sterne issue a warrant for the arrest of William Simons. They informed Sterne that Simons had tried to kill a free African American blacksmith named William Goyens. Sterne did as the men asked and then did not hear about Goyens or Simons for the rest of the evening. The next day Sterne learned that the gunshot wound Goyens received had not been fatal and that he was expected to recover. This episode related in Sterne's diary over a two day period is interesting because of the editorial inserts Sterne made. On August 27, 1842, when he first heard about the attempted murder, he interjected, Several People in Town all very merry. Then on August 28, he said that the wound Goyens received was not enough to do any good. These comments Sterne made are telling of the mindset toward Goyens. Sterne made no record of any personal grievances with Goyens, but it is clear that he was not on good terms with him, nor was he popular in town. This attitude may have stemmed from Goyens's position as a free black man and slave owner.","The feeling of Texans toward free blacks during the Texas Republic was one of fear and distrust. According to Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen, Many Texans feared that the existence of a free black population would undermine the institution of slavery. To guard against free blacks living in Texas and being a bad influence on slaves, Texas required free blacks to obtain permission from Congress to live in Texas. During the early 1840s measures to prevent free black occupation of Texas increased. President Mirabeau B. Lamar gave the order that all free blacks had to leave Texas by January 1, 1842. Luckily for the free black population, Sam Houston repealed this law upon his reelection in 1842 and allowed free blacks to remain in Texas. ","The shooting of Goyens occurred right in the time period of the early 1840s when Lamar had decided to crack down on the free blacks in Texas. The bad feelings of white Texans toward the repeal of Lamar's law could be the reason for the joy of the townspeople at the shooting and Sterne's disappointment at the murder being unsuccessful. To add to their dislike was that Goyens owned some slaves himself. The presence of a free black man was bad enough, but the presence of a free black slave owner would have been too much for some. Goyens showed that there were opportunities for blacks outside of slavery, a notion dangerous to a society built on the enslaving of black men and women.

The diary of Dr. Walter Wade proved that even in the mid-nineteenth century that this concept was not a foreign one. A large percentage of his journal was dedicated to a documentation of his private medical records. In a February 21, 1848 entry, Wade described his Monday night visit to a woman named Sarah. Wade devoted few words to the entry, but his impact was nonetheless powerful. He succinctly stated that, Sarah had an abortion at 3 mos. Wade provided the reader with sparse details about Sarah, but he did mention that the terminated pregnancy had consisted of twins. However, he was unable to learn the gender of the pair, presumably because the pregnancy was not far enough advanced. Wade maintained a business-like and professional tone throughout the passage; one can only assume that this detached air his writing emanated was reflected in his actions as a physician."," An individual's livelihood was undoubtedly unstable in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of, High infant mortality rate and tragic loss of loved ones to disease or accident in the prime of life, according to historians James and Dorothy Volo death became an accepted and inexorable fact of existence. As a whole, individuals found it easier to resign themselves to the reality of mortality, and doctors, who were already required to uphold an air of formality concerning their patients, were no different. Doctors undoubtedly practiced abortion in the antebellum South, but because it was a sensitive and often taboo subject, it is difficult to find example of it recorded. Some instances of abortion have been discovered among the records of slave women who were either unable to care for their children due to the harsh demands of their required work or whose children were often sold by avaricious masters. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, one woman was forced to watch as her master put all of her infant children up for sale, until, taking matters until her own hands, she decided that she was not going to let her master sell that baby. 'She got up and give it something out of a bottle and purty soon it was dead'. Says Fox-Genovese, these desperate women saw either terminating their pregnancies or killing their own children as a, ... way [to reclaim] it as their own. In a perverse way, infanticide could be seen as a means to give children life. "," There is no way to tell from Wade's brief diary entry what the primary motivation was behind Sarah's decision to abort her babies.

Wesleyan Methodist preacher Jesse McBride had stirred too much controversy among whites and slaves in Guilford County.  Intending to run McBride out of the county, about two-hundred men gathered on May 23, 1851 outside of the church where he would preach that morning.  For six hours McBride had been on the road, not finishing the 18 mile journey to his Liberty Hill congregation outside of Greensboro until a few minutes before noon.  Accounts of the exchange between McBride and the disgruntled locals vary according to source.  The mob leader and slave-owner Hoover blocked McBride from entering the church.  McBride appears to have kept a cool head in the confrontation: he drew upon scriptural resources, he induced his congregation to sing hymns in front of the increasingly frustrated mob, and he conducted his congregation in prayers. Without personal violence or abuse according to the local <em>Greensboro Patriot</em>, but with considerable, drunken man-handling according to McBride's personal account in the abolitionist <em>Liberator</em>, the mob shoved McBride into his carriage.  He rode away.  Sometime immediately thereafter, local powers obtained his pledge in writing to depart Guilford County within a week.  McBride returned to Ohio.  The <em>Liberator</em> published his first account on June 20 and then a more elaborate version on August 15.  The <em>Greensboro Patriot </em>expressed relief and anticipated a return to tranquility in its brief account of the incident.  ","The creed of Wesleyan Methodists involved an antislavery stance, and for this reason many whites no longer tolerated McBride's growing influence among the Christian circles of Guilford and Stokes Counties.  On May 18, Reverend Hines of the Methodist Episcopal Church had stated the deleterious effects of McBride's sermons in a meeting.  Local officials held another meeting in Greensboro on May 20 for the purpose of suppressing abolition agitation.  During the meeting, McBride was implicated directly for interfering with the property rights of local slave-owners.  He had created enemies among nervous slave-holders and among vexed preachers whose congregations were splintering over slavery.","Beginning with zeal in 1831, when William Lloyd Garrison began publishing the <em>Liberator</em>, and gaining controversial attention in the wake of Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion, the Abolition crusade began making its presence felt among slave-holders.  Because Southern churches' policies accommodated slavery, the Methodist Church split in 1844, and supporters of slavery established the Methodist Episcopal Church.  This episode in McBride's career strengthens Donald Matthews' description of the brave extension of the Evangelical ethos beyond the internal life of the believer and into social relationships. McBride's<em> Wesleyan</em> sect of Methodism, which threatened excommunication to those who would not emancipate their slaves within two years, scared slaveholders with its judgmental views.  McBride's brave efforts to nurture an anti-slavery parish illustrate both the active efforts of anti-slavery ideology and the physical resistance these efforts met from pro-slavery interests."],"display_date":"May 18, 1851 - August 15, 1851","search_date":"1851-07-01","locations":[{"id":9489,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2420,"title":"Paternalism, Slaveholders, and the Guilty Conscience","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-02-27","end_date":"1851-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 27, 1851, John M.

Throughout the letter, there was a tacit understanding of Drake's financial difficulties; one can assume from Folkes' reply that the end aspiration of Drake's request is purely monetary in nature. However, Folkes was not quick to comply wholly with Drake's wishes. He replied that both the slaves and Drake himself, chose me for their master. He called the slaves in question, a part of his family, and asserted that, they have become indentifide with my family. He goes so far as to name two slaves that he would particularly like to keep, a man named Abram and another individual whose name is illegible. Folkes' letter did not solve what was clearly a complex and hotly contested issue between the two men. But Folkes did show a judicious side and agreed to discuss the matter in person before any further action was taken."," John Folkes was one example of a larger group of slaveholders that emerged in the midst of the slave South. Folkes fought Benjamin Drake's desire to sell his slaves because, he argued, they were not only members of his household, but of his family as well. Folkes' words reflect a growing sentiment among slaveholders in which buyers believed that their participation in the slave market was actually beneficial to the slaves. Slave-buyers had the power to keep family units in tact by purchasing all the members of a slave's family. This paternalism, historian Walter Johnson states, caused slaveholders, to say that they were acting on behalf of the people whom they had bought to act for them. Therefore, in retaining certain family units, buyers believed they were actually doing their slaves a favor. "," From his firm reply to Drake, Folkes clearly ascribed to this sentiment of paternalism, and vehemently wished to retain both his household and the members of his slave family. But in doing so, he also yielded to a certain delusion in thinking that he helped his slaves by any means.

He began the 26 mile journey from Gaston to Fayetteville on foot and let the coach catch up with him along the way.  By one o'clock, though he had covered almost ten miles, he doubted he had passed even half a dozen farms.  Olmsted took lunch at the Banks' plantation where fresh horses for the stagecoach grazed in the field.  To Olmsted's dismay, the fresh horses could do but little more than stand up.  At last the stagecoach arrived but its ineloquent driver could only mutter distressed comments about the horses: There ain't a man in North Car'lina could drive them horses up the hills without a whip. With the help of several black men, the driver at last thrashed and verbally harassed the ostensibly-fresh horses into action.  Three miles later, using real, outright, old-fashioned, uncompromising English oaths, as loud as he could yell, the driver again resorted to violence as onlooking passengers idled.  This time he used a rail.  Exasperated by the wait, some of the weary passengers offered assistance. Olmsted resorted again to his own legs and by eight p.m. arrived at Mrs. Barclay's inn where his fellow passengers did not arrive until three a.m.","In this vignette from North Carolina and in many other instances throughout the South, Olmsted journeyed down isolated, poorly-maintained roads, detailing the poor condition of transportation.  The roads he traveled often comprised little more than deforested trails.  At points, he traveled for several days and never saw two dwellings of mankind within sight of each other. Several plantation patriarchates were miles apart. He recorded his many experiences and minute-by-minute conversations in over seven-hundred pages, which he gave to the New York Daily Times.  That Northern editors considered Olmsted's observations exotic enough to be published attests to a communication gap between the North and South.","Olmsted's accounts of Southern transportation deficiencies support Stephen Goldfarb's analysis of geographical isolation as a limiting factor to Southern industrialization.  He endured the same arduous traveling conditions as Piedmont farmers who sought distant markets for their produce.

They applauded the satiric criticism as the severest and most truthful against Stowe and her British supporters. The poem was written as if by a British aristocrat who both commends Britain for banishing slavery and yet also foppishly implicated British class differences as equally, if not more, merciless than American slavery.  <em>British</em> peasants, it reads, are not our slaves, and 'tis tickingly pleasant, / To think they have <em>free</em>dom - to die in a ditch The eight stanzas levelled many shocking attacks against British institutions.  For example, the article implied that Britons permitted their women to work in coal shafts on hands and knees without clothes.  One line, which would have particularly resonated in 1853 read, Though Irishmen rot in the fever and famine, / Which we have created- we speak it with pride- / <em>That, if you will calmly and fairly examine</em>, / You'll find they were perfectly free- when they died","    Stowe's novel introduced further turmoil to a tumultuous era of United States History, during which embittered pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions bemoaned the Compromise of 1850.  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants, fleeing the distresses of famine and poverty in Ireland inflated America with visible proof of English oppression.  The North Carolinian editors' concise but harsh attack against Stowe, similar in logic to James Henry Hammond's 1858 Mudsill Theory speech, argues that slavery eliminates the need for downtrodden white peasants in societies.  ","In the larger context of understanding how white Southerners justified slavery, this article exemplifies one method of neutralizing Stowe's potent attacks against slavery.  The <em>Register</em>'s editors attempted to devalue <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> by showing that other civilized nations were themselves reliant upon impoverished labor.  By this logic, Stowe's supporters abroad had no right to comment upon American institutions.  Wendy Hamand writes of a similarly anti-British response to incidents such as the Stafford House Address, a document from British ladies requesting an end to slavery.  Mrs. John Tyler from Virginia responded that the Duchess of Sutherland should tend to her own dependents and leave American ladies to attend to theirs.  Clearly, the tendency to reject Stowe rather than re-evaluate slavery prevailed among pro-slavery factions."],"display_date":"June 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-06-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2443,"title":" Lunsford Lane Denied Extension of Residency\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-11-03","end_date":"1841-05-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A free man must go.  After three years of recommendations, petitions, and court proceedings, the Senate of the state of North Carolina denied Lunsford Lane extension on his residency in the state to allow more time to purchase his wife and seven children.  Lunsford had been commended and allowed by his employer, the Governor of the State, to remain employed in the Governor's office keeping order, running errands, and making deliveries, according to a letter sent to the Legislature.  The letter acknowledged that this would be against the North Carolina law that required free slaves to leave within twenty days of being warned out. In 1840, the Secretary to Governor Dudley wrote the first request for Lane's extenuating circumstances.  The letter was answered with no objection, but the situation was considered a legal matter, which resulted in Lane being summoned to court. Due to an unprepared prosecution team, the case was postponed for three months, which allowed Lane to negotiate a petition of relief to be signed by over twenty men and sent to the Legislature for evidence of his strength as a respectable, hard-working man.  When the Court finally met and his case was argued, Lane was not allowed in the Senate chamber because he was a colored man and waited in great fear and anticipation.  The members adjourned and harshly reported Well Lunsford, they have laid you out; the nigger bill is killed.  This was a cruel reality, laced with mockery from the white members of the Senate, and Lane claimed to have felt defeat at its worst and utter hopelessness in the face of humanity.  He was not only denied, but also banished from North Carolina, departing three days later on May 18, 1841, for New York City.What is significant about this narrative is the blurred definition of freedom in all-white institutions in the South.  The freedom granted to Lunsford Lane is an example of the restrictions placed on blacks even after they reached their ultimate goal of liberty.  Freedom was never really free, as historian Robert Fogel found in research of slaves and their owners.  The act of denying citizenship and any extended privileges were both absent from the lives of freed blacks in almost every state, which often left them still suffering from oppression in a white supremacist society, no matter what physical or mental state they were in.  In Lane's case, even though he was awarded freedom, his material conditions and life working for the Governor at least allowed him to be close to his family and earn a substantial living, which were not guaranteed with his freedom."],"display_date":"November 3, 1840 - May 18, 1841","search_date":"1841-02-08","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2450,"title":"INDEPENDENCE DAY, 1881:The Founding of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-04","end_date":"1881-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 4, 1881, Booker T. Washington helped Lewis Adams, a former slave, make his dream a reality. The founding of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute ushered in a new era for African American education in Alabama and the nation. Booker T. Washington began his career the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, under General Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Washington's keen mind and brilliant thoughts got the attention of General Armstrong who begrudgingly mentioned Washington's abilities to George Campbell, a citizen of Tuskegee and president of the Board of Trustees at the Tuskegee Institute. Campbell, a former slave owner, was working through specifics with both Lewis Adams and State officials in Alabama to create an institute of higher learning and trade, primarily for African American pupils. Campbell sought the leadership of a strong black figure and found it in Washington.","The Institute was lucky to have many legislative allies. Two white senators, W.F. Foster and A.L. Brooks, were so enamored with the idea of the Tuskegee Institute that they sought to secure its future by acquiring state funding for the project. Foster and Brooks were able to urge the appropriation of two-thousand dollars worth of state funds for teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries were just the tip of the iceberg. The school lacked land, buildings and faculty members. When Washington arrived in Tuskegee in June of 1881, the Institute was extremely disorganized. In a mere month, in preparation for the grand opening, Washington managed to secure a single school building and several other necessities. Later Washington wrote in his journal, I opened the school...in an old church and a little shanty that was almost ready to fall down from decay.","It was evident that the only way to sustain the Tuskegee Institute was with more funding. Washington was forced to ask for every resource. He petitioned his friend Mr. Francis Chickering Briggs asking, My first great need is apparatus, such as maps writing-charts, globes. I thought by writing to you I might get a great many of these kid of thing which you would not miss there. He continued his quest, writing James Fowle Baldwin Marshall; Dear Friend: Please send me the addresses of some publishing houses where I can get my books at reduced rates. Over the years, Washington's fund-raising efforts paid off and the Tuskegee Institute, which opened its dilapidated doors to 37 students in July of 1881, grew significantly. At Washington's death in 1915, the Institute had 1,500 students, a two million dollar endowment, and instruction in forty trades, one-hundred fully-equipped buildings, and about 200 faculty members.","The founding of the Tuskegee Institute was important to blacks, not only in Alabama but also the South. The Institute provided an education in particular trades and this specialized education enabled blacks to better themselves and their socioeconomic status by providing employment opportunities in the wake of slavery and servitude. Blacks from all reaches of the South and even into the North traveled to Tuskegee to enroll and learn in an environment conducive to progressive race relations. Tolerance of education for blacks started to increase on July 4, 1881 and would continue to climb due to the addition of the Tuskegee Institute to the antebellum landscape of Alabama.

November 5, was a chance to right the wrongs of the election of 1870, only two years prior. The 1870 election included the race for secretary of state and James T. Rapier, born a free black in Florence, Alabama just thirty-three years prior, was on the ballot. Rapier became a prominent figure early in his life, participating in the National Negro Labor Convention (NNLC) and working as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessor among other involvements. It was not until Rapier became the first African American in Alabama history to run for a state office that his popularity nearly doubled. ","Despite his historic run, Rapier did not win the election of 1870. Klu Klux Klansmen, who, based on their beliefs, had obvious qualms with Rapier's attempt, intimidated voters with threats and violence. The Klan's interference made it nearly impossible for Rapier to garner support. Thankfully Rapier was neither discouraged nor fearful of the Klan. He courageously continued about his efforts in order to better situate himself for the 1872 midterm elections to follow. Rapier sought out allies in the black community in order to gain endorsements from any recognizable resource. He established himself as a republican and mounted an impressive campaign for Congress. His travels took him to nearly every area of Alabama. But, it was not until Election Day in 1872 that the fruits of his labor were realized.","Election Day was calm and peaceful. As hoped, blacks crowded the polls early in the day, showing their support for their fellow black citizen, James T. Rapier. Previous elections in Alabama had become violently protested, but the elections of November 5, 1872, proved to be perhaps the most tranquil in Alabama election history. Unhindered by interference and intimidation, nearly 70 seventy percent of the voter's turned out at the polls. As the totals were tallied, it was evident that Rapier would win, sweeping the Black Belt and carrying over one thousand white votes. Crucial to his victory was the fact that throughout his campaign James T. Rapier focused solely on planks in his party's platform. Rapier refused to discuss his race, citing it as a feature unique to him that would not negatively affect his leadership in Congress.","The election of 1872 proved to have a positive influence on racial opinions in the state of Alabama. Electing James T. Rapier to Congress sent a message to others in the South that repressing race was not the answer and no longer the norm. There were those in the South who still vehemently opposed the election of a black man to Congress. Despite opposition, it is important to realize the intense progress of the black race. Less than ten years prior to the election of James T. Rapier, blacks were enslaved pieces of disenfranchised property that counted as 3/5 of a citizen.

The city's two main roads were still, the farms and fields hot with the summer sun; the rural environment uninterrupted. The only sound for miles was that of a train barreling down the Rome and Dalton railroad.","The events both inside and outside of the train did not reflect the peace and quiet that lent itself to Patona. Earlier that morning, a fight had erupted inside the train between a white boy and a black man. The assault escalated when the train came to a stop at Patona/Cross Plains and others joined in on the fray. It was not until later in the evening that Green Little, a former slave mustered up a small army of men to continue the day's events at Cross Plains. William Luke, an Irishman, an immigrant and a Methodist minister did his best to persuade Little not to settle the score. The pistol-touting Little refused to listen and continued on as the night grew dark and sticky with the evening heat. ","Hearing the news of an imminent attack, members of the local Methodist Church began to flee. Commotion ensued, bullets whipped the wind and gunfire could be heard for miles. For 48-hours Cross Plains was in distress. Women and children sought safety while their men combated neighbors in the streets. The chaos was quieted by Major Bailey, a confederate veteran and a current administrator at the local school house. Bailey took measures to turn the prisoners over to the sheriff and the men involved in the conflict were then escorted down the tree-lined streets of Cross Plains. They were quarantined and questioned in the schoolhouse. The instigator, Green Little was no where to be found. ","The local sheriff started his questioning about the incident with William Luke who immediately admitted his role. Luke had sold the pistols to the black men of Patona, making him liable for the incident. Witnesses gathered and a disorganized trial commenced. The evening grew dark and the hour late, accordingly the trial ceased and was scheduled to resume the next day. It was at this late hour, when bystanders had returned to their homes, that local members of the Klu Klux Klan executed a vicious plan. The Klan, known for their racial hatred and violence, hid armed in the shadows as the prisoners settled in for what would be, unbeknownst to them, the last night of their lives. ","The Klansmen attacked the prisoners, hitting and dragging them down the street and well across the railroad tracks. The mob stopped upon reaching the edge of town at Prior's Station. Torches lit, ropes in hand, the Klansmen prepared to exterminate Luke and his black counterparts. Three blacks hanged first, followed by two more. Luke was allowed enough time to write his wife. In his letter, he claimed he his death was deserved and God would certainly forgive him. The executioners had been quick to kill the black men, but one of their own, Luke, white male, took consideration. Luke was hanged in a different fashion and even in death received better treatment than the black men around him. On the morning of July 12, 1870, the day following the attacks, all was reported as quiet at the Plains. ","The incident at Cross Plains exemplified the deep-seeded hatred that continued to plague certain sections of southern states. Calhoun County, Alabama was no exception. Factions of the Klu Klux Klan could be found in every former confederate state. Similar incidents, like that of Cross Plains, occurred with regularity in other areas. The Civil War may have ended in 1865, but battles continued to rage in tension filled regions of former confederate strong holds.

In the local section, no less than nine anonymous editorials gave the citizens their neighbors' opinions concerning the election.

The second called Roosevelt a demagogue and hypocrite, and attacked his play to the negro and apparent boast of his son sitting next to a black student. The other editorials concern Mr. Bryan and McKinley and their speeches and parties. Those editorials also attacked or praised the other candidates, but not with a racist angle.

The paper also provided longer articles on the candidates and their positions and politicking to give structured and informative answers to the citizens' questions and concerns.

As Edward Ayers explains, the newspapers played a vital role of spreading ideas and opinions in the county. Alfred Stone believes that Roosevelt's actions during the campaign and then during his first few months in the White House insulted the South in a way that no one had done for many years. He also believes that the attitude most held was that Roosevelt had damaged the relations between the races, not that he improved them by trying to make their lives better. The Democrats campaigned against Roosevelt by attacking his warm relations toward blacks and encouraged the growth of the fear that the South had toward Roosevelt.

Ultimately, this article was an attempt to rally immigrants in support of the Democrat Party by showing that supporting Republicans would not give immigrants equal rights.","During the 1840s, the composition of America's workforce underwent a dramatic makeover. Immigrants came from predominantly two countries, Ireland and Germany, but also from an array of other European countries. This influx of foreign people would impact American society in virtually every way possible, whether through art, the economy, ideology, or culture. The newcomers provoked resistance to change and adaptation. The opposition to immigrants appeared in third-party platforms denying foreign-born citizens full political rights and eventually wove itself into the foundation of the Republican Party, with the Democrats as the opposition.","This article in the Staunton paper, January 8, 1861, shows how local activists encouraged immigrants to vote against the Republicans.

The papers offered a means for the abolitionist groups and movement to spread throughout the country.

The mission of The Colored American was the moral, social, and political elevation of the free colored people; and the peaceful emancipation of the slaves.  The paper aimed to give coverage to abolitionist activity in the North and help advance the cause of African Americans liberty across the entire country.  Author James Horton believes African-American Newspapers succeeded in providing both a political and social link for black people throughout America.  Many free blacks in the South subscribed to the paper because it gave them a sense of hope, as they read about African Americans changing society in the North, even though it was a risk for them to subscribe."],"display_date":"June 15, 1839","search_date":"1839-06-15","locations":[{"id":5989,"lat":39.5105141884,"lng":-77.3162251993,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2507,"title":"Saul Runs Away\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-07-13","end_date":"1840-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Twenty-year-old Saul had been a slave his entire life and was tired of being treated in inhumane ways and separated from his family.  He ran away not only to escape the oppression of slavery, but also because he has a mother and brother in Baltimore, and it is probable he is about there.  To Saul and many other slaves in the South, familial ties were strong.  The deeper reasons for Saul's flight are unknown, but the separation he faced from his family was a common reason why many slaves throughout the South ran away. Even if slaves had been separated, theirs was still a tight community.  In Walter Johnson's book, <em>Soul by Soul</em>, Thomas Jones was taught from a young age about the strong ties of his family because his parents cried when they talked about the fear they had of their children being torn from them and sold into the slave trade.  This dread that families had of separation forged tight bonds that lasted even after they were separated, causing many to run away in order to return to their families.  Slave owners throughout the South recognized the deep familial connections and some would not punish them by the use of a whip, but would threaten to sell them from their family if they did not cooperate.  The threat of splitting up a family was enough punishment to force a slave to abide by his master's conditions.

Directly under and advertisement of ten pigs for sale, there is the section of lost property, for which rewards are offered. There are six articles that report lost animals or slaves. 50 is offered for a stolen black horse, as well as 50 for a dark bay mare. Intermixed with these ads for horses, are rewards for runaway slaves, ranging from 50 to 300 per slave. Descriptions of color, markings, age, and last known location are given for slave and animal alike. The only difference in description between the two categories of lost property is that the horses are reported stolen, while the slaves are reported as runaway; logically showing that the horses could not have let themselves out of their gates. ","This underscores the status of people, slaves at the time, were property. The moral ambiguity and hypocritical self-justification did not matter as much as the value that slaveowners attributed to this human commodity. Slave traders would have associates search the country for good bargains on slaves. They would attempt to buy low and sell high and would willingly risk loss if a slave sold for less than purchases or even died. The slave demand had a clear connection to the cycles of the agricultural economy, the harvesting of various crops in different regions.","Walter Johnson outlines the methodical process in which slaves were separated from every part of their person identity, except their unbreakable souls. Slaves were stripped down of their personal character and taught new skills in order to provide a commodity to the customer; whatever type of slave was needed was offered, whether a field hand, a butler or a mistress. Out of this systematic trade of humans, the beginning of self-emancipation was born, Slaves sometimes stood up in defiance of being sold, even if it meant suicide, and all slaves became unified in slave communities, while they waited in pens to be sold."],"display_date":"May 12, 1863 - May 13, 1863","search_date":"1863-05-12","locations":[{"id":13639,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2538,"title":"Freedom of the Black Press?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-20","end_date":"1889-08-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was just another days' work for two employees of the Alabama Great Southern train company.  On the evening of August 27, 1889, the trainmen pulled into the Birmingham station and prepared to disembark.  Upon exiting the train, the workers spotted two black men swinging from trees in the near distance.  According to sources at <em>The Washington Post,</em> the lynched men were the incendiary editors of the black newspaper, the Independent.  The editors were allegedly run out of Selma, Alabama the preceding week and supposed to have been lynched in Birmingham.  <em>The Post </em>noted, It is impossible to get particulars.  ","<em>The Post's</em> report incidentally concluded the dramatic Selma controversy first exposed in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> on August 20, 1889.  The article, Alabama's War of Races, shed light on the racial tensions that plagued Selma.  On August 19, Reverend Edward Bryant, associate editor to the Independent wrote a highly controversial editorial attacking the whites of Selma and the larger southern community.   In his charged conclusion Bryant projected, You have had your revolutionary and civil wars and we here predict that at no distant day we will have our race war, and we hope, as God intends, that we will be strong enough to wipe you out of existence and hardly leave enough of you to tell the story.  According to the Tribune, Selma mayor, E. Starr publicly condemned the revolutionary nature of Byrant's editorial.  Both sides built up arms in the likely event of a violent outbreak.  Mayor Starr held the pledge of Confederate veterans to fight on behalf of the uniformly armed white population of Selma.  Bloodshed and conflict appeared almost unavoidable.   ","Racial tensions and violence plague the history of Alabama.  According to historian Virginia Hamilton, the use of violence was originally disconnected from racial issues, oftentimes settling disputes between whites settlers.  However, the tradition of violence in Alabama eventually shifted towards African Americans in the years following the Civil War.  Hamilton writes, Violence, the hasty recourse for settling scores between white men in frontier Alabama, was focused upon blacks after emancipation and war had proclaimed them to be people instead of property.  Initially the fear of a black uprising involving armed and newly freed slaves drove groups such as the Ku Klux Klan to persecute and execute countless African Americans in Alabama.  Towards the end of the century, however, statewide politics influenced many lynchings across the state.  One such example was the infamous 1882 lynching of black Republican leader, Jack Turner.  When Turner's Choctow County voted Republican in the 1882 gubernatorial election, the Democrats panicked.  With an upcoming congressional election the Democrats could not risk losing political power to the Republicans; Turner was shortly after found hanging from an oak tree.  ","    <em>The Post's</em> report of the lynching fits into the larger story of southern lynching in the post-slavery era.  A vague allegation of criminality motivated lynchings throughout the South.  There was an average of 150.4 lynchings per year during the last 19 years of the nineteenth century (1882-1900).  These lynched victims were usually accused of raping white women or other trivial crimes.  The murder of the two Independent editors does not fit into the general theme of crime retaliation seeing as the only crime committed was in their exercise of freedom of speech.  However, the story of Rev. Bryant and his associate editor at the Independent portrays the lingering fear of a black revolution.  The perpetual threat of black retaliation for slavery remained imminent in the minds of southern whites and the lynching of Bryant exemplified this fear.

The Tuskegee Institution invited the black community to witness what work the school has turned out, how that work is accomplished, and what is the character of the general population in which the raw material comes. Gathered in the hall were, perhaps a thousand colored people...mainly old-timers... including many who had journeyed more than 30 miles to view the spectacle. The audience listened to lesson recitals during the morning sessions and rhetorical exercises during the afternoon with perfect delight. The article also paid significant tribute to the inspiration behind the school, Principle Booker T. Washington. Washington, a man of unusual force and ability for any race, grew the school from the ground up with the aid of seed money from the state in the amount of 2,000. From this grant in 1881, Washington founded his school in a church with 30 students and one teacher. By 1887, the year the <em>New York Times</em> reported on the school, Tuskegee had grown to 275 students. With awe and reverence, the <em>New York Times</em> chronicled this communal gathering and paid their editorial respects to Washington for such a tremendous educational achievement. "," A vital piece of Alabama history lies in the foundation of the Tuskegee Institution. The institute's creation was intrinsically tied to Alabama state politics. The Bourbon Democrats gained control throughout Alabama between the years of 1874-1900. According to historian Allen Goings, the Democrats seized political control of Alabama in 1874 by waging a strenuous campaign based almost exclusively on the race issue. In strategic political move, W.F. Foster, a Democratic candidate for the Alabama Senate, traded black votes with a promise to create a school for the African American community. Under Washington's leadership Tuskegee admitted its first class of 30 students in 1881. Washington had his students build the Tuskegee Institution with their own hands to prove labor as both practical and dignified. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, in advocating hard work and teaching practical skills, Washington hoped to see his race rise through gradual and nonconfrontational change. "," Through Tuskegee, the nation witnessed the beginnings of racial change. <em>The New York Times</em> praised the creation of Tuskegee in the middle of one of the darkest and most hopeless parts of the South. Booker T. Washington had a vision of his black community rising through the ranks of society and Tuskegee proved a first step. Despite all that was in store for the black community in the South, the Tuskegee Institution proved a foundation for social change.

J.M Neal purchased a large amount of corn from Trice and stayed at the store until 1A.M. when he boarded a train for Pulaski, Tennessee.  Authorities suspected that Warren and his accomplices entered the store at 2 A.M and killed Trice in order to rob the store of money and dry goods. Locals discovered that a  rainy night left footprints leading to Warren's house.  Before authorities could question the African American community, a mob took Warren a mile down the road and hanged him.       Despite the circumstantial evidence facing Warren for the murder of a white man, blacks rarely experienced justice in courtrooms when the crime involved a white man.  Southerners who favored lynching worried that a lengthy jail sentenced prolonged death and allowed African Americans to seek divine forgiveness. Warren's case was just one of several thousand lynching cases after the Civil War.  In many cases, angry mobs grabbed the first black man a bloodhound came across. Before trials could occur, mobs stormed jails and grabbed black men.  Local  judges and police were either involved or submitted to  mob  justice.       With the promise of racial equality created by voting rights, lynching attempted to create the same racial order that existed under slavery. Lynching was rare before the Civil War because slaveholders did not want to destroy their own property.  After Emancipation, Southern whites feared that the younger generation of African Americans born outside of slavery had not yet learned the code of deference and submission in the South. One black observer believed that lynching set an example, knowing full well that one Negro swinging from a tree will serve as well as another to terrorize the community.        Rural areas such as Warren County in Tennessee typically had the highest numbers of lynchings in the South.  There were strong racial tensions in rural areas where there was an influx of new African American settlers that the white community was unfamiliar with. These strange niggers, as they were labeled, did not have anyone in the white or black community to vouch for their character.   Southern Kentucky, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas were rural states  that also had the highest lynching rates in the South.    In Warren County, it would have been difficult for law enforcement to protect Wesley from a furious mob.  Since the majority of lynching occurred in secrecy at remote locations in the South, historians will never know the exact number of lynching victims, but they estimate that it was around five thousand.

The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

More and more of her former slaves left her land as 1866 began. She felt sad to see people go whom she had known all her life. Louisa Minor mentioned in her diary the change in everyday life as the ex-slaves departed. She stated that though ice was available outside, no one brought it inside, because there were no servants left to do the work. She wrote as if that kind of labor was totally foreign to her. Louisa Minor respected the right of her former slaves to leave the plantation, but she had trouble seeing her ex-house slaves go. When she described her children's nanny, Nancy, as well as other former house slaves named Mammy, and Aunt Peggy, she revealed the reason for her sadness, constant proximity. White slave-owners gained closer relationships with their slaves when those slaves were working alongside them. When her freed slaves left her land, Louisa Minor and her children found the absence of those they spent time with everyday to be the hardest to bear. ","This relationship between black and white women was a common element of slavery because of the nature of work done in whites' houses.

These relationships were sometimes worse for slaves because a cruel master could deride the slave all the time if they were always around. Thus Louisa Minor's pain at seeing her ex-house-slaves leave was an expression of the relationships by which whites took advantage of slaves while acting as if they were doing it out of good-natured paternalism.

Republicans charged that the Ku Klux Klan intimidated both white and black voters on behalf of the Democratic Party.  In that election, C.A Sheafe won close election 44176 to 3810, but the Republicans should have won a landslide with 7,800 newly registered black voters.  The House of Representatives agreed with the conclusion of widespread voter intimidation and passed a resolution that gave the seat to the Republicans.","To verify the Republican's claim of voter intimidation, officials interviewed numerous voters representing both parties and the evidence showed the KKK did prevent Republicans from reaching the polls. George McMichael, a former slave from Coffee County, reported that he returned home after voting for the Republican ticket and found the Klan waiting for him.  They tied him down on a log and whipped him two hundred times.  An African American by the name of Washington Ore testified that The Klan surrounded his home, but he escaped by jumping through his window. He said, they shot two shots at me, but did not hit me at that time. When he returned to his house, his crops were torn to pieces in retaliation for his Republican vote.  Although the Klan was a small organization that was unpopular in the early 1870s,  the organization gained strength and helped the Democrats win back the state government  by the late 1870s. ","Horace Maynard and the Republicans' effort to secure black voting rights in Tennessee was a political struggle in a divided region. The emergence of seven thousand new black voters threatened to break the even division between Republicans on the eastern part of the state and the agricultural interests of middle Tennessee.  Tennessee had a history as a moderate state before the Civil War when it voted for the Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell instead of the Democrats. The same radical group of Democrats that pushed the moderate state of Tennessee into the Civil War, turned to violence in the postwar years to prevent a Republican advantage. Each party tried to forcefully keep the other away from the polls.  George Brunlow disfranchised the old Democrats until 1867. Once the Democrats, returned to the polls, Brunlow reluctantly gave African Americans the right to vote in order to solidify Republican power.  Tennessee was the first state in the South to take the monumental step to allow African Americans to vote.  When the Klan desperately resorted to violence and intimidation to gain a political advantage, Governor Brunlow, refused to certify the results in Tillman vs. Sheafe election.  He stated,  the votes cast for a candidate are illegal and his election void and that the KKK have used violence and other means of intimidation to deter legal voters from exercising franchisement.  With a slim majority threatened, Republicans fought to secure black voting rights for political reasons rather than the moral cause of equality.  Similarly, the Klan showed that they were not primarily motivated by race when they attacked large numbers of white and black Republicans.  Tennessee Republicans were more concerned with building new industry than the impoverished condition of African Americans that did not improve under their administration.  Republicans knew that the Party of Lincoln did not need to help African Americans to guarantee their votes on election day.

The slave did not deny his crime and appeared to show no remorse at the time of his execution. The only excuse offered by Dave for this gruesome act was that he had been drinking before the time the act was committed. Those who were there to witness his hanging claimed that his demeanor was indifferent towards his fate, and that he even dared to smile at times. Between the daytime hours of twelve and two, Dave was publicly hung by the town sheriff. The body dangled for thirty minutes before it was cut down and buried. Upon his burial, many physicians from neighboring towns rushed to his grave site to be the first to claim the body for dissection. ","We do not know anything of the events that induced Dave to murder his master. Since Dave offered no excuse for his crime, one can only speculate upon his possible stimulus. Dave could have murdered him for any number of reasons. A sexual advance on a loved one by his owner, persuasion by another white man, or any other perceived injustice brought upon him could have provoked Dave to commit this deed. ","However valid the crime's impetus, the murder of a white man at the hands of a slave or person of color was considered a serious offense punishable by death. Historian Joshua Rothman argues that although most African Americans who murdered their masters were sentenced to hang, many were not forced to endure this harsh sentence due to the intervention of other whites in the town who could vouch for the particular slave's character. In the instance of Dave, however, this intervention did not occur. From the tone of the article announcing the hanging, Dave showed no remorse for what he had done. His indifferent attitude, the lack of significant reason for the crime he committed, and the apparent lack of respect received from the members of the white community most likely did not lend itself to an appeal for a more lenient sentence."],"display_date":"November 17, 1848","search_date":"1848-11-17","locations":[{"id":12441,"lat":36.2251619225,"lng":-82.4967689306,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2577,"title":"The Elite South are Immune\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-09-07","end_date":"1832-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A cholera epidemic struck the United States in 1834, affecting southerners in every social standing. However; elitism and negative racial attitudes ultimately influenced perceptions about the transmission of the disease. Todd Savitt, a historian specializing in nineteenth-century medicine and disease stated that white Virginians often related high morals, clean living and orthodoxy to immunity during the cholera epidemics. White paupers, free blacks, and slaves because of their sinful ways, degraded condition, and filthy habits were viewed as the prime targets for cholera. Whites, who may have revealed symptoms of Cholera, were often diagnosed with diarrhea, dysentery, or fever rather than to be diagnosed with the poor man's disease. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported the first case of malignant cholera in Richmond, it was not surprising to Virginians that the first victim was a slave boy. The master of the young boy wrote an urgent letter to the Richmond Department of Health describing symptoms of cholera and the condition of his dying slave. The young boy, an eleven year old subject to fits of diarrhea and incredibly dehydrated died a few hours later in the tobacco factory of his master. The young boy exhibited the principle symptoms of cholera: bouts of profuse diarrhea. The Richmond Board of Health traced the cause of cholera to the young boy's consumption of contaminated pears. The Richmond Board of Health would later publish statements connecting the supposedly crude eating habits of the underclass to cholera. "," Location rather than race and class attributed to the prevalence of cholera among free blacks, slaves, and lower class whites. According to Dhiman Barua and William Greenough, medical professors specializing in cholera epidemics, the cholera bacterium thrives in water ecosystems and transmits through the ingestion of water or food contaminated by fecal mater. Those living close to cities express high rates of vulnerability to the disease.  Transmission rates of cholera in the nineteenth-century South rose because of unsanitary conditions in newly developing cities. In Richmond, the James River and the Kanawha Canal provided opportunities for cholera to spread through low income homes and slave quarters. Free blacks, urban slaves and lower class whites throughout the South faced increased susceptibility to cholera that was attributed to densely populated housing, inefficient waste management systems and close proximity to local rivers, rather than race and class."],"display_date":"September 7, 1832","search_date":"1832-09-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2578,"title":"Freedom in Fauquier\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth Centuries, Fauquier County was a county with many African American slaves. However, Fauquier County was a county with a few freed African Americans. In 1820, the Fauquier County Census counted 11,167 slaves and 507 freed African Americans. In 1830, there were 12,612 slaves and only 621 freed African Americans. Therefore, in those 10 years, the number of slaves increased by 1,445 and the number of freed Blacks increased by only 114. ","Every freed African American that resided in Fauquier had to register. The person's name, age, color, and status were recorded. Also, if the person has any distinct marks on their body, the location of the mark was recorded. Some people listed had records of how they obtained freedom. Catherine White was 22 years old and 5 feet and 1 inch. She had two scars on her left arm between her elbow and her wrist. She was born free. Ceasor Madison was 68 years old and 5 feet 7 inches. His recording stands out because instead of describing any scars on Madison's body, the clerk describes his nose. It is stated that his nose is thinner and higher than most people of color. The people are also described as being having a very dark complexion, bright mulatto, or dark mulatto.","In part, the Fauquier records show the stark difference of the number of slaves versus the number of freed men and women in Fauquier County. Yet the number of freed slaves did grow in that ten-year span. T. H. Breen and Stephen Innes' book, <em>Myne Owne Ground: Race and Freedom on Virginia's Eastern Shore</em> focuses on the community of freed blacks in Northampton County. Just like these free blacks in Fauquier County, the freed blacks of Northampton had to register their names with the clerk. These people were like normal citizens.

The total crop for the year for all four men was worth 2,033 dollars  Mr. Bills took 515 dollars for rent, or  twenty five percent of the four men's total crop.   These landless tenants had no choice but to accept the high rent that Bills offered.  Instead of growing his own crops, Bills relied on his dozens of tenants to farm his thousand acres and provide his substantial income.  While Bills returned comfortably to his home, his white and black tenants faced the  bleak economic reality of declining cotton prices. "," Unlike a crop-lien system, Bills charged a flat rate rent in order to reduce the risks associated with tenant farmers. The trend continued on a regional level in Georgia where the number of cash tenants grew from 18,000 in 1880 to 59,000 in 1900. At nearly seventy years old, Bills was too old to oversee that tenants properly tended to the cotton fields.  Although it seemed like a lucrative business, landowners found it difficult to keep tenants because farms competed for the lowest rent.  Heavily indebted tenants could leave unexpectedly without paying for goods that Bills provided.   With cash tenants, landowners did not need to keep a store or furnish any goods.   Landowners increasingly avoided the crop-lien system, as they did not want their tenants to rely on them for food to feed their families. Tenants knew how much they had to produce to meet their rent and landowners could isolate themselves from the harsh realities of tenant farming.  Since landowners did not have any personal stake in the success of their tenants, Bills could retire to a leisurely life of hunting and fishing instead of supervising the farm. ","Lower commodity prices caused by overproduction after the Civil War made farming a difficult life for  landless African Americans and whites.  More efficient cotton processing and new farming methods flooded the European and northern markets with cotton, corn and tobacco causing commodity prices to plummet.  Still, agriculture was firmly ingrained into the landscape of the South  for generations and industrial opportunities were scarce.   Recently emancipated African Americans with little education turned to the familiar cotton farming of the antebellum period. The lack of affordable land forced both white and black landless farmers  to accept high rent.  If there were blight or an early frost, tenant farmers risked not having enough money to feed their families. ","White landowners had a complicated relationship among white and black tenants.  If both the tenant and the owner were white, they enjoyed a closer relationship than with African Americans.  Landowners would often work aggressively to help their white tenants to succeed while having little contact with black tenants.  Black and white tenant farmers developed tensions when they competed for the best crops and the best land.  Whites especially resented successful black farmers who challenged white supremacy.  Even though believed they were racially superior to black tenant farmers, they were on the same economic ground.  In many ways tenant farming placed whites and blacks on equal ground. Increasingly, white tenant farmers felt stigmatized for sharing the same economic status as African Americans."],"display_date":"January 26, 1870","search_date":"1870-01-26","locations":[{"id":12066,"lat":35.2116486435,"lng":-88.9878590321,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDEMAN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2587,"title":"Lawlessness and terrorism in Wilson County, Tennessee","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-09-07","end_date":"1871-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Described as a well-liked African American in the community, Isaac Creek was attacked in his cabin in the middle of the night by a group of armed white men.   Creek fatally shot Thomas Lyons after refusing to surrender to the prowlers who attempted to burn down his cabin.  The Williamson County Journal's editor reacted with rage at what he viewed as intolerable lawlessness on the part of the band of young prowlers.  Although the white man Lyons was killed, the editor argued that Isaac Creek deserved the same right to protect his property from criminals that the law guaranteed regardless of color.  The editor proclaimed that the  whites who perpetrated the crime  disgraced the soil of our good county.         The editor of the Williamson County Journal felt that Isaac Creek's property rights were more important than upholding white supremacy.  Only six years earlier, Tennessee lost thousands of men fighting to preserve the property rights of all southern slaveholders.   Regardless of color, most whites supported anyone's right to self-defense from lawless criminals in the unpopular Ku Klux Klan. In the 1870s, the fact that Creek was a black who murdered a white man did not define the editor's opinion. The decade following the Civil War was before disfranchisement and legalized segregation made race the defining issue  southern justice.  Unlike The Atlanta Constitution that glorified racial violence, newspapers around the state of Tennessee condemned the  emerging Ku Klux Klan.  A large segment of the population of Tennessee were former Union loyalists and Republicans who were equally threatened by attacks from the Klan. The editor of the Williamson County Journal applauded Isaac Creek because the local community valued property rights and legal order more than upholding the racial order.         Stories such as Isaac Creek's show that race was not the defining issue of southern legal rights in the 1870s. During reconstruction, African Americans voted and gained representation in most southern states.  Tennessee was the first state to allow African Americans to vote in 1867.  Once union troops left the South in the late 1860s, former Confederates once again seized the power in the government.  Democrats ushered in a violent period of segregation and lynching that lasted until the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   Cases where African Americans had the same legal rights show that segregation and disfranchisement  were not  inevitable outcomes of emancipation.   Southerners defended the long historical emphasis of property rights regardless of color.

Before the slaves could appear in front of the court, they escaped from the jail. The slaves were apprehended once again and placed in a Worchester County, Maryland jail.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

Following the colonization trends of the time, the Richmond Enquirer reported in 1830 that Ohio will send good slaves to Canada. In Ohio, and in other areas across the South, whites became fearful of the ever increasing free and slave population.

A Mississippi man's letters include harrowing murders, vigilante activity and a purported slave insurrection.  Rattled by the violence, the Mississippian, James Carlson, in a letter to his former schoolmate, Virginian Robert Whitehead, detailed the events with fear and warning.  Lawless men brutally murdered a mutual friend on his plantation. In the wake of the violence, white vigilante groups raided and hung gamblers in Vicksburg, while others uncovered and hung slave conspirators planning a massive insurrection.   ","      The Vicksburg Volunteers, as the self-selected white male Mississippians called themselves, did not wait for the slow and uncertain arm of the law rather, they hung the villains who upset social order.  Vigilante groups, as characterized by Richard Brown in <em>A Strain of Violence</em>, developed in the absence of effective law and order in the frontier region. According to Carlson, vigilante violence continued in Madison County, where an insurrection movement among Negros was discovered...and by all accounts...12 Negros and two white men were hung in the manner of Vicksburg. [After they were hung, the insurrectionists were left hanging for 24 hours as an example.]  Many more both Negros and whitemen (who were at the head of it) have been taken and put in prison.  These are harsh measures but the times require them.  In Madison, Hinds, Warren and Yazoo, the greatest excitement prevails and armed patrols are moving in every direction. Armed patrols were not site-specific to Mississippi. ","      Brown argues, vigilante groups, in this case the Vicksburg Volunteers and the armed patrols, fit into an American doctrine of vigilance, used in early 19th century crises of war and expansion.  Recalling historical precedent (in the 1810's vigilante groups formed in Virginia as a home guard during War of 1812 and in 1817 Florida when threatened by a Spanish-Mexican navy) and propagating a democratic ideal of popular sovereignty harking back to the American Revolution, vigilante groups saw themselves as uniquely American--lawless but justified.

In 1881, Walter Rountree took a walk one day from the University of Georgia with his brother and some of his friends. They encountered two African American men at the town courthouse and a conflict ensued. All the men drew their pistols against one another. In the shooting that followed, Walter Rountree was shot and later died after being carried back to his home. There was almost a riot in the town because the students were upset with the African American men. An examination of the pistols used proved that the gun that killed Rountree belonged to his own brother. However, the African American men involved in the conflict were tried for assault with intent to murder [and] found guilty. ","Georgia's society in 1881 had a guideline for social interactions between blacks and whites that were regulated by strict laws and customs. Because African Americans and whites were living in areas very close to each other and there was still animosity among these southerners, whites felt that it was necessary to have these laws to prevent conflict. The research of Edward Ayers shows that southern whites thought that blacks were to blame for the violence and that black men were...inclined toward...crimes of passion. The laws would help to keep their passions under control and prevent violence. Ayers discovered that some of the social customs that blacks had to observe were that African Americans could not address whites by their first names and could not socialize with white members of society. Since Rountree's community in Athens, Georgia was composed of blacks and whites, it is not unusual that a conflict resulted between him and his white friends and the African Americans in their town. ","African Americans were in a disadvantaged position in Georgia's society, especially concerning the law. The account of this event puts the blame for the conflict completely on the two African American men involved, although there was probably much confusion among all the men. Then the two black men were found guilty for assaulting the white men, but there was no mention of any punishment for the white men. Professor Ayers found that there were many laws created that discriminated against African Americans in society, such as vagrancy and labor laws. Due to the strong southern ideals of white supremacy, blacks were disadvantaged in social situations and in law."],"display_date":1881,"search_date":"1881-07-02","locations":[{"id":1659,"lat":33.9512553453,"lng":-83.3674565844,"zoom":10,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2652,"title":"English Travelers Visit a Black University in Atlanta, Georgia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-01-01","end_date":"1884-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the year 1884, two travelers from London, England set out to tour the Southern United States. Upon reaching Georgia, the men stopped to visit Atlanta University, an African American university of the state. Their tour of the university led them to observe that the rooms at the school were light, clean,... and cheerful, and that the work of the students at the school was done exceedingly well. After making such observations, they researched the reports made by the Georgia State Board of Examiners about Atlanta University. The Board found that the school created capable students who were equal in their maturity of thought and... ease of expression to students from white universities. The travelers also asked one of the professors if he perceived a difference in learning ability of black students based on the darkness of a student's skin color. The professor told the men that he felt no difference existed. Overall, the men felt that the state of Georgia was making improvements in providing a better education system for black students and decreasing discrimination toward African Americans. ","As outsiders observing Georgia's society, the two men visiting the area made judgments on the African American education system and noted how whites and blacks made judgments about each other. African Americans proved that they were capable of creating a successful educational environment and creating successful students. The research of historian James M. McPherson shows that education in the South during this time period was not up to desired national standards for whites or blacks because of the huge numbers of all southerners not receiving any education. McPherson also noted that because schools were segregated, it was difficult for African Americans to receive an equal education that students received at white universities. The state was forced to try to create equal education standards because separate equality was demanded by law. The Georgia State Board of Examiners may have declared that the school was able to produce black students of equal learning ability in order to avoid punishments from the federal government if they had provided unequal educational opportunities. Since the white men who were outsiders to the area made a judgment similar to the State Board of Examiners, however, there was probably truth to the statement. Although the travelers were impressed with the ability of white men to admit to the equality of black students, the white men were more likely to be concerned with repercussions from the federal government than improved conditions for African Americans."],"display_date":1884,"search_date":"1884-07-01","locations":[{"id":1822,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2660,"title":"Sex Across The Color Line\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-16","end_date":"1895-03-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The town did not look on Thomas J. Penn, a prominent white man, with favor as they suspected him of committing a rape and two murders. In Danville, Virginia, Penn raped ten year old, defenseless Lina Hanna. Penn, her owner, badly injured Hanna, an African American, who was very lucky to have survived. The rape was not the only disaster in this story. The biggest mystery of all was the disappearance of Lina Hanna's mother and sister. Many suspect that Penn, in order to silence the witnesses, murdered both women. Some townsfolk believed that he discarded of the bodies in another state. Regardless, Penn was successful in covering up his actions and destroyed any way of himself being accused of such a violent crime. Penn terrified Hanna's mother and sister, and they did not want to accuse him in fear of the possible consequences. ","White masters raping their young black workers was a frequent occurrence, before, during and after the Civil War. This instance involving Hanna and Penn was just one of many situations in which sex crossed the color line. Some were voluntary actions of both parties, while some, such as the story of Lina Hanna, were rapes. ","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women. Black men and women began to try to stop the abuse; whenever a black woman would enter a store where a white man would be, there would be a group of black men waiting outside for her. "," Although its prevalence declined, interracial sex did not stop; it moved from the plantations to the towns, where there were more opportunities for a sexual act to go unnoticed. The populations in towns were constantly changing, and the chance of an intimate moment between two people of different races, who were unacquainted, was far more common without the possibility of affecting the lives of either person. "," The rape of Lina Hanna is different from the trend at the time, because it occurred on a plantation. This specific instance became less common after slavery ended and time went on. Although the trend was changing from plantations to towns and less defined areas, rape was still happening between the white masters and their black slaves.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year. Each week the names, race, alleged crimes, place lynched, and date of the lynching were listed for all those who had been lynched during that year. Each week someone picked up the newspaper to see if anyone had been lynched since the previous week. "," For the week of May 29, 1897, there was not a new lynching listed since the past week, but there had been 28 since the beginning of that year. Lawrence Brown, an African American, accused of arson near Cranbury, South Carolina, was the first one to be lynched in 1897. At least one out of the 28 lynched were white. Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill, lynching was community-sanctioned murder, and death was usually accompanied by torture and mutilation. Lynching did not start to decrease until the 1950s.

He saw political corruption especially in the Governor's office. The governor was suspected of having unethical intentions with the State railroad. He seemed to have had financial investments in the railroad that benefited him greatly, but he observed that overall the railroad benefited everyone in the state. The traveler judged that Reconstruction [had] been a complete failure there due in part to the controversy in the city. ","After the Civil War, Republicans designed policies intended to increase the productivity of the South and industrialize the area. Eric Foner noted that the Southern law...was redesigned so as to encourage the free flow of capital in the South for industrialization. These policies left the state governments that were controlled by Republicans in charge of distributing the capital in ways to improve the economy. This made the situation more complicated by creating opportunities for corruption. According to Lewis Nicholas Wynne, people in Governor Bullock's office had the opportunity to accept bribes and Bullock was able to use the capital to reward loyal followers as patronage, which made many people suspicious of corruption in his policies. Democrats were unhappy with the Republicans because of their supposedly corrupt practices and the harsh policies of Reconstruction. The political tensions between both parties made it easy to start accusing people of corrupt practices, especially the governor.","Railroads were the focus of Southerners' attention during the years after Reconstruction. According to the research of Edward Ayers, there were many reasons why the railroads had such an impact on society. First, he showed that the creation of railroads that would stretch across the country created the need for making time zones and creating a standard time. Also, he noted that the railways were important for bringing commerce to the South that created new towns. This commercial aspect of Southern towns made them more similar to Northern towns and allowed them to assimilate with the rest of the nation. Another impact that Ayers noted was the creation of segregation laws concerning the railways. White men disapproved of the idea of black men being able to sit near white women because of the threat of sexuality between whites and blacks. Thus, Ayers wrote, the more closely linked to sexuality, the more likely was a place to be segregated.

In order to help this concern, The American Colonization Society was founded in 1817. Border States such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia had the most chapters because of their locations and ideas about slavery. In Virginia, many prominent men were members of this society, including James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hartwell Cocke of Fluvanna Country. The Society was a national club and needed to keep its members bonded together on one common cause. One way that they accomplished this was to send out a newsletter called the Circular. "," The 1819 Circular, informed John Cocke of a colony that was in the works of being established in Africa so that the Society could finally put its thoughts into action. Despite only being two years old at the time, the society already had strong ideas and a plan to bring about colonization. They worked out their plan in great detail to ensure that it would work and go over well; they knew minute details such as which port the slaves would leave from and where the former slaves were going. The colony that the Circular publicized was Liberia. In 1821, Liberia became the colony of African American colonization in Africa; the city of Monrovia was the major city of this colony, named for President James Monroe. This letter was an informational letter sent to all of the members to show progress in this endeavor; many other letters followed to keep the members posted on development in the project."," This Colony was formed out of fear that if slavery were abolished and the slaves were left in America as freedmen, they would revolt against their former owners. Virginia, Cocke's home state, was the first place in America to hold slaves and had already experienced turmoil from unhappy slaves. Virginians feared slave revolts like the Gabriel Revolt of 1800 and the Denmark Vessey Revolt in Haiti in 1822. They feared that since they had held slaves for so long that they slaves would have a strong vengeance against the slave owners. Colonization seemed like the perfect alternative; it would slowly ease the slave holders away from slavery and get the enslaved people away from the land of their former masters and back to their homeland."," Colonization was a dominate idea in the United States in the era before the Civil War. Some southerners favored colonization because they did not want to have their slaves turn on them after they were freed, and northerners did not want African Americans in their country because of racist feelings that were prevalent in the North in the early nineteenth century. Both regions could agree on this alternative to abolition, despite their obvious differences about slavery. The American Colonization Society combined these regional fears into a club with a common cause that all Americans could relate to and support."],"display_date":1819,"search_date":"1819-07-02","locations":[{"id":13904,"lat":37.7601235969,"lng":-77.4908797136,"zoom":9,"place":"HANOVER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2717,"title":"Mistaken Identity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-14","end_date":"1893-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mrs. M.A. Moore, widowed mother of seven grown children, was alone in her home one morning. As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount?s claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent.

He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

Despite notices of Joe's capture, Sheriff French Strother was unable to prove the certainty behind his claim, because no one from Miss. Rust's estate came forward to verify his freedom or to prove he was their property. Without proof that Joe was either free or enslaved Sheriff Strother concluded that he was a runaway. A public auction for Joe's re-sale into slavery was then scheduled for January 2nd, 1841 at the Rappahannock County Courthouse.  Sheriff Strother advertised in the local paper that Joe would be sold to the highest bidder, to be paid for in cash.  Joe had no voice within the law.  Even if he was telling the truth, Sheriff Strother could not let him go free without proof of what he said was true.  Why would Strother believe him to be telling the truth anyway?

Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2735,"title":"Proud, Patriotic Song of an Arkansas Colored Regiment","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Written in 1863 by the white Captain Lindley Miller, the First Arkansas Colored Regiment of the Union army proudly sang the Song of the First Arkansas to become excited for training and battle.According to Miller's notes, the marching song was sung to the tune of John Brown's Body, which is significant because they honored Brown, the well-known man who attempted a widespread slave insurrection in Harper's Ferry, Virginia in 1859.The song speaks for the patriotic, proud, and dedicated black soldier.The lyrics glorify the fight for de Union and de law.The black soldiers outright profess that they hab done with hoein' cotton and hoein' corn, and they demand they dey will hab to pay us wages, de wages ob their sin.The song incorporates many elements of abolitionist thought.It demands treatment from whites as equals, demanding that whites bow their foreheads to African Americans and a right to property.A political allusion to Father Abraham and his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 also exemplifies blacks' desire to attain the rights sanctioned to them by the government.Miller's song is a patriotic one, and it is revolutionary in its inclusion of blacks into the American sphere of citizenship.According to Ronald C. McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O. Allen and Clayton E.

Delivered by Benjamin Morgan Palmer of the First Presbyterian Church, this sermon advocated southern secession in defense of its providential trust to perpetuate slavery. Palmer believed that slaves were by nature incapable of self government and dependent upon their masters for protection. Dr. Palmer's reasoning is sound, sensible, and Christian to Wadley who yearned for the South's fighting for the patriarchal cause of slavery. Dr. Palmer justified slavery through the patriarchy of a white slaveholder who protected the dependent slave. Wadley's opinions were typical of the Lower South during the days after Abraham Lincoln's presidential election, and sectionalism grew quickly and passionately, even in women's minds. According to Samuel S. Hill and Charles H. Lippy, Palmer's sermons on slavery, namely this famous oration, led to his position as the elected moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America. Wadley listened to Palmer with attentiveness and respect; she, like many other white southerners, believed in the doctrine of slavery as a divine right from God granted to the South. Wadley relates another sermon from a Dr. Lord, which summarizes the mistaken piety of abolitionists in their attempts to emancipate enslaved people from southern masters. Dr. Lord derived his preaching from Isaiah, and he condemned those who setting up their own judgement and their own code of morals instead of religion, and the scriptures, condemn that which has been sanctioned both by the bible, and by ancient usage. This sermon reflects the religious doctrine of southern clergymen prior to and possibly during the Civil War.

In 1881, Talladega  County proposed a vote on the outlaw of alcohol consumption and the African American population allegedly voted in a bloc against the prohibition. The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.  Ayers argues that whites gave black voters a great deal of credit when dry forces won because of their perception of blacks as swing voters.  Nevertheless, the black voters were also held responsible when the dry forces lost.

He was later released for lack of evidence. On the following Saturday, December 30, an unknown group of people sought retribution for the alleged robbery and bombarded Gray's home, pounding violently on the door and walls of his house. No serious outcome resulted from that night's altercation, but the party returned to Gray's home on the following evening, repeated the hostility, and demanded that Gray come out to discuss his thievery. Gray refused to appear, and members of the group tore a plank of wood from Gray's door and repeatedly shot into the house through the hole. Gray received bullet wounds in the arm and stomach and died from his injuries. A man named Jim Williams also received serious wounds in the gunfire, as a shot in the forehead resulted in his death five days later. Calvin's stepson received a bullet wound in the leg, but was not fatally injured. Nine or ten people were arrested for their involvement in the bombardment, but all were released for lack of proof of their involvement. ","Gray's story reveals the disparate attitudes that whites possessed toward African Americans in Hawkins   County, Tennessee in the nineteenth century. The Hawkins County legal system treated Gray fairly, dismissing his crime for lack of proof and releasing him even though he was black. However, Gray's murderers did not grant him the same respect, as they violently assaulted him for unproven petty thievery. Gray's death displays the duplicitous nature of many southern whites in the late nineteenth century, as Gray's killers repaid an apparent legal injustice with an even more repulsive injustice. While Gray's killers believed his alleged robbery required retribution, they defied the legal system by punishing Gray outside of the system and by enacting a punishment egregiously disproportionate to the crime. ","Gray's murder served as an informal, citizen-organized judicial system, fulfilling historian Edward Ayers' argument that whites lynched alleged black offenders in the nineteenth century to uphold their perception of justice and to terrorize blacks into acquiescence. While the white mob did not lynch Gray, they terrorized him and might have lynched him if he had succumbed to their demands to exit his house. Instead, he was killed by gunshot for allegedly stealing a few hogs. Ayers argues that the majority of lynched African Americans in the nineteenth century South were tortured and killed for charges of murder, rape, or violation of white womanhood; however, Calvin Gray was hunted down, terrorized, and killed for the alleged robbery of a few hogs. Such disproportionate punishment suggests that some whites in the late nineteenth century possessed an even more severe hatred for blacks than previous accounts indicate.

On the night of his execution, Pratt was provided with spiritual advice in preparation for his execution.  While get readying himself for death, Pratt confessed to the crime for the first time.  At 12:00 a.m., thirty guards escorted Pratt out of the jail to the gallows near downtown Marietta.  The guards allowed Pratt to smoke a cigar, and they talked pleasantly amongst each other.  When Pratt arrived at the gallows, 8,000 people were waiting to witness his execution.  After an African American minister recited a prayer, Pratt publicly confessed his crime and expressed a willingness to die.  At 12:45 a.m., the drop fell, his neck broke, and he completely stopped moving thirteen minutes later.  The guards cut down Pratt's body, giving it to his father, brothers, and sisters who witnessed the execution.","Pink Pratt's execution demonstrates an uncommon instance when a nineteenth-century southern judicial system legitimately accused, convicted, and punished a black man according to the law, even though he committed a violent crime against a white female.  While a white perpetrator may have received a lighter punishment, Pratt was treated in a reasonably fair manner, considering the usual treatment of black offenders in the late nineteenth-century American South.  Pratt was executed as a criminal who committed a heinous offense, but the legal system fairly granted him the traditional religious rituals that it granted white offenders upon their execution.  The nineteenth-century Cobb County judicial system deemed a black criminal worthy of humane treatment, despite the horror of his crime.  ","Pratt's story challenges the traditional account of white reactions to black violent crime against whites.  As historian Edward Ayers argues, southern whites in the post-Civil War era were convinced that blacks were more dangerous than whites and that black men were more inclined to commit crimes of passion.  Nevertheless, the <em>National Police Gazette </em>did not portray Pratt as an atrocious creature, but depicted him talking pleasantly to his guards and expressing a willingness to die for his crime.  He was not portrayed as the brutal, dangerous monster that many southern whites declared blacks to be.  In addition, the public allowed his execution to occur through the legal process.  Ayers argues that black criminals were frequently kidnapped from jails, tortured, burned, and hanged by white mobs because whites believed such blacks were unworthy of legal execution.  However, Pratt was allowed to die through legal execution even though he raped a twelve-year-old white girl.  According to Ayers, whites often justified a lynching simply because the black offender committed the usual crime of sexual assault upon white women.  Whites assumed that black men lusted after white women and they even justified lynching blacks when they committed a minor violation of white womanhood.  Nevertheless, despite Pratt's severe violation of the dignity of an innocent white child, he was permitted to die through formal execution.

Before his move to Alabama, Walton aided African Americans in Southern Missouri and hoped to soon retire from his missionary work.  However, Walton attended the Quaker Illinois Yearly Meeting, which inspired him to resume his responsibilities as a teacher of underprivileged African American children.  Walton stated that he heard both the African Americans and his Heavenly Father calling him to assist the destitute.  Walton organized two First-Day Schools in Stevenson without public school funds.  He repaired the schoolhouse, provided new books for the pupils, and personally paid for many of the students' tuition fees.  Walton temporarily refused a salary in order to lighten the financial burden of the African American families.  Walton personally financed the education of orphans and the children of indigent parents who were unable to work because of sickness.  On November 17, Walton wrote a letter to the Quaker journal, the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em>, requesting aid for his school, asking for donations of Bibles or Testaments, juvenile reading books, First-Day school books, tracts, and papers.  ","Walton emphasized the religious aspect of his work with African Americans, underscoring the belief that God called him to help the mentally, religiously, and financially impoverished children of Stevenson.  In his letter to the<em> Friends' Intelligencer,</em> Walton wrote that his work often caused him mental and physical hardship, arguing that hardship was necessary for fostering spiritual growth.  Walton also implored the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em> readership to sacrifice for the sake of others, saying that religious work should not be confined to those with great ministerial gifts, but should be employed by all Christians.","Walton's sacrifice for the African American community in Stevenson, Alabama supports historian Edward Ayers' argument that those who took Christianity seriously recognized equality among believers and often developed a feeling of fellowship and tolerance towards others.  As Ayers argues that some people within churches tried to reach across racial divides, Walton broke through those divides by teaching the needy children of Alabama. Walton felt great tolerance and even love for his schoolchildren, as he perceived his work as a call from God to help the children plagued by injustice.  In addition, Walton's experience fulfills what historian Robert Handy calls the most significant development in evangelical volunteerism in the post-Civil War era: the growth of Sunday school work lead by lay teachers.

When Austin moved into an African American neighborhood, the white community in Knoxville ostracized her for her work and the area in which she lived. While the community did not object to educating African Americans, they believed that only a very destitute and lowly woman would fraternize with blacks. Initially, Austin worked under the Freedman's Bureau, but when the Bureau was dissolved, she financed the school with personal funds and donations from northern friends. When the school became overcrowded, she erected a large schoolhouse, which she donated to the city, requiring that it always be used to educate African American students. In 1881, Austin grew to believe that she needed to reform her curriculum, as she believed that teaching the arts and sciences left the black students idle, thriftless, and contemptuous of work. Thus, Austin began to declare that industrial training was the only practical education for African Americans, because African Americans could only find employment in the industrial sector. She established industrial training for her students in the departments of sewing, gardening, domestics, and carpentry, but she faced much opposition from the students' parents. The African American parents opposed their children studying different subjects than white children. Austin continued to teach the industrial classes, but split the school day into sections of traditional teachings and industrial teachings.","Austin faced much difficulty in her profession, as both whites and blacks snubbed her for work. Austin said that her greatest difficulty was the African American opposition to her work, but she continued to educate her students because of her strong belief in the importance of industrial education for African Americans. Austin argued that African Americans held a great disadvantage in professional studies, making it impossible for them to compete with white students and gain professional positions. She also argued that education in the arts and sciences lead black students to despise manual labor. Thus, she argued that African Americans needed industrial training to convince them that good, honest work was the only way to make them good citizens. ","Historian Edward Ayers argues that the majority of educated African Americans in the South were limited to employment in manual labor because of their skin color. Ayers states that many educated African Americans despised manual labor, as they believed they were wasting their education if they accepted such work.

Calhoun on the rights of states and slavery, Susan Bradford Eppes spoke with her parents about enslavement. While her father supported slavery as a slave owner himself, Susan learned that her mother opposed the institution. Susan said that her mother believed that white slave owners were the real slaves in the relationship. Having slaves required added work and responsibility for slave holders that outweighed the benefits. It was her preference that all the slaves be freed and sent to Liberia. Susan responded to her mother by telling her that she would miss her slave, Lulu, if she were sent to Liberia. ","In 1816, the American Colonization Society was formed with the intentions of solving the race problems in the United States by relocating all blacks to Liberia. This organization and its cause became increasingly popular and reached its peak in the 1830s. While Mrs. Eppes spoke with her daughter almost two decades later, she recounted some of the beliefs that the Society put forward in support of colonization. They argued that being a slave holder was, in fact, an agonizing personal burden. The American Colonization Society said that not only was being a slave holder overly demanding, but simply freeing slaves was impossible. Whites and blacks could never live together in a peaceful society. The need to expatriate slaves demonstrated the obvious racism in the United States. Though Mrs. Eppes opposed slavery, she still believed that blacks could not live as free people in America."],"display_date":"June 27, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-27","locations":[{"id":1395,"lat":30.4456509268,"lng":-84.292206157,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2764,"title":"Durham Handbook Reveals Thoughts on Local African Americans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"1896-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Educator Company, comprised of a group of people dedicated to the advancement and prosperity of their towns, released a Handbook of Durham County in 1895. In the introduction, the authors stated that their intention was to give people seeking a new home a brief description of the area and the advantages it offers as one of the foremost cities of the South. Throughout the book, they gave detailed accounts of various aspects of the county, including its public and private facilities, advantages and needs, and its relation to the state as a larger whole in terms of its products, climate, government, and people. "," When the handbook begins discussing the people of Durham, it mentions the negro population, and states that it was largely descended from former slaves, but the importation of those forced laborers was very rare at the beginning of the 18th century onwards. The authors then attributed the large number of blacks in the area to natural causes such as a healthy climate, a humane public system, and the kindly tempers of the owner They stated that African Americans were happy to stay within the state because of the affection shown to them by their previous masters. Since slaves' emancipation, the book claimed African Americans have been shown absolute equal rights, with the exception of the slightly larger poll-tax and property tax, which the writers attributed to their population within the state, not their particular race. When discussing suffrage later in the hand-book, the authors explained why African Americans are withheld from administering to the law themselves as magistrates. It is because, explained the authors, blacks have just been released from slavery and are therefore ignorant of the duties of citizenship. This, the authors claimed, is for everyone's safety, including the colored man. "," This extract is a commentary on the county of Durham that reveals a great deal about their identity. The Educator Company explains current race relations and demographics with a history of the treatment of African Americans, and claims that Durham is a harmonious community now because it has always been so, even in the times of slavery. This belief, as well as the reasoning behind the disenfranchisement of African American's rights, is representative of many other counties' and states' racial ideologies in the South at the turn of the 19th century. "," At this point in time, several southern states were passing laws or constitutional amendments depriving black citizens of their right to vote, or at least making it very difficult to do so. Jim Crow laws were also very popular, and North Carolina was on the brink of adopting the separate but equal statute following the Plessy v. Ferguson trial. Finally, a ruthless white-supremacy campaign launched in 1898 completed a decade of setbacks for African Americans living in North Carolina. This second-class citizenship was adopted by local, state, and national legislatures, and indeed, the vast majority of Americans. However, despite these obstacles, the black community still focused on improving their condition and bettering their community. Contrasting to the Educator Company's opinion of the political ignorance of African Americans, many of them became involved with and supported the newly formed Fusion political party, a combination of Populists and Republicans."],"display_date":"1895 - 1896","search_date":"1896-01-01","locations":[{"id":9427,"lat":36.0420245844,"lng":-78.889350822,"zoom":10,"place":"DURHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2767,"title":"Klan Murders Senator Stephens\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-05-24","end_date":"1870-05-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Three days passed before the news of Senator Stephens? assassination reached Maria Massey Barringer.

On account of his political principles, Stephens was stabbed, choked, and left dying on a woodpile in a rear room of the courthouse. Prior to his murder Stephens had been advised by Victor Barringer that his life was threatened by the KKK, however Stephens ignored the warning. When the lynching of four blacks did not catch the attention of the citizens, the Klan was determined to take the life of a white man. Stephens supported the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League, and helped to politically organize the black population of Caswell County. The Freedmen's Bureau not only intervened in white Southerners economic relations with black laborers, but it also helped to mobilize these laborers into the Republican Party. As a result, Senator Stephens became an enemy to the white Democratic Party. Governor William W. Holden responded to the challenge of the KKK, by illegally declaring martial law and sending troops into Caswell County. Local law enforcement could not cope with the hit-and-run tactics of the Klan, and Holden knew that nothing short of martial law would suppress them.","The function of Klan violence was to socially and economically curb Republicans and control the black population. After the Democrats gained control of the legislature in 1870, they impeached and convicted Holden for illegally declaring martial law. As historians Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris emphasized, the Klan?s use of violence was temporarily effective in securing political power.

The masked men took the accused and slaughtered each and every one of them. While the law enforcement had not yet decided whether to take action or not, blacks in the community felt the incident was critical enough to call a town meeting. They intended to discuss plans of a mass emigration from the South Carolina county in order to avoid further racial intimidation and discrimination.","At the end of the nineteenth century, race relations worsened as racial violence replaced efforts to harmonize blacks and whites in the South. Crime increased during this period which in turn caused people's responses to crime to grow more severe. Lynching became a popular way for whites to threaten and maintain social dominance over black suspects and criminals. This was especially prevalent in areas that had weak law enforcement, such as rural places like Barnwell. White citizens had to protect themselves, especially against a group they considered so dangerous.","Yet law enforcement played a larger role in lynching than believed by historians. It was not the lack of authority that allowed lynchings to occur. Rather, it was their neglect to take preventative measures. Most private mob lynchings, such as this one, actually got their victims from the law enforcement itself. In fact, over 80 percent of those lynched had previously been in police custody. Therefore, it was not extraordinarily unusual for a group of men to enter the jail and remove its inhabitants without question.

H. Arnold of Walton County, Georgia placed an announcement in the Athens Southern Banner offering a 50 reward to anyone who found his runaway slave. In most ways this ad was like any other runaway slave reward announcements. It reflected the basic ideology of slavery that the slave was property that rightfully belonged to its owner and should be returned if found.  In this particular ad, though, Arnold also recognized less visible characteristics of race relations in the antebellum South. In his announcement, Arnold speculated that the runaway was decoyed away by a white person and that he may obtain a free pass and leave the country.  ","What type of white person in Georgia in 1842 would have encouraged a slave to run away? Was this white person that Arnold suspects trying to take the slave for his or her own good or trying to help the slave escape?  Though we cannot determine what is the most likely answer to these questions for Arnold's case specifically, the possible answers demonstrate the complexity of race relations in the South from the onset of the Slave Trade in the South up to the Civil War.  ","It is plausible that Arnold feared that a slave trader kidnapped his slave to sell him somewhere else.  The slave trading business was an extensive system and we know that traders and bandits kidnapped slaves and free-blacks in order to sell them.  It also would have been logical for Arnold to fear abolitionist involvement in his slave's escape.  Part of the work of abolitionist groups in the antebellum North was to help blacks fleeing slavery to get safely to the North.  Though very secret at the time, we are now aware of an extensive system referred to as the Underground Railroad that was in place to assist runaway slaves.  Blacks and whites worked together to make the Underground Railroad function.  Whatever Arnold specifically feared about possible involvement in the disappearance of his slave, his fear is evidence that the white people interfered with the institution of slavery as well as upheld it.

The Presbyterian Clergyman was wounded but was expected to recover.  In Athens, the Southern Banner reported this incident stating that though they did not know the details, they feel fully justified in saying that no provocation whatever, was given by [Mr. Davis], to cause this outrage.","Travelers through the antebellum South faced many dangers. Among the most frightening to white travelers was the possibility of coming into contact with Indians. In the 1830?s, the threat of Indian attacks was heightened as a result of President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act and the treaties that followed.  During this period, Jackson used treaties to try to force Indians of the five nations that resided in the southeastern United States - the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chicasaw and Seminole - to migrate west. While some Indians agreed to move, others resisted Jackson's efforts and chose to stay. Most of the population of both the Creeks and the Cherokees would have remained in Georgia and Alabama in 1835 when Davis was traveling. Without protection against land hungry white settlers, though, the Indians that stayed often lost their land and were left destitute. Frustrated with their situation and angry with Jackson and their white neighbors for trying to force them off of their land, Indians were known to steal from and attack white neighbors and passers-by. ","In its report of this incident, the Athens' <em>Southern Banner </em>implied that the Indian attacker was unprovoked in the outrage he or she committed. The article did not consider the probable outrage the Indian felt at the marginalization and poverty he or she faced. In hindsight, the title of the article, Indian Outrage, might be read as an outraged Indian taking out his frustration over the actions of President Jackson. As this article's perspective shows, white southerners at this time lacked such sympathy for the Indians. The same lack of sympathy was visible in the incident of the Trail of Tears, when Indian nations were forced to migrate and walk across the South to new homes. ","The aggression that existed between white southerners and the Indians was both a result of and a contributor to the theories of rationalizing the forced migration.  President Jackson argued that the Indians would be better off in the Western lands where they would not have to face attacks from white southerners.  This theory that it would be better for the Indians if they moved, created even less sympathy in white southerners towards those who chose to stay."],"display_date":"January 15, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-15","locations":[{"id":1654,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2814,"title":"Fatal Racial Confrontation Provokes Black Soldiers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-11-29","end_date":"1898-11-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late November 1898, Private Will Kempin, a black soldier in the Third North Carolina Regiment stationed in Macon, Georgia entered a saloon intending to buy a drink.

Kempin, upset over the discriminatory policy, had an altercation with Simmons' brother and then angrily left the establishment. Later he returned with a group of fellow soldiers and continued the heated argument, creating a violent scene. As the altercation grew more out of control, Simmons shot Kempin in defense of his brother. It was unclear whether the wound was fatal, but Simmons was still arrested by authorities. Word finally reached back to Kempin's camp, and on November 29, a rumor spread through the city that the regiment was planning to escape the encampment in order to riot in retaliation for their fellow soldier's assumed death.","At first glance, this was just another story about how the reaction to segregation became deadly and the divided system did not serve as a resolution to the racial violence and struggles facing the South. Only two years before, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson, legalizing separate facilities for the races. This justified Simmons' refusal to serve Kempin, and to defend that right, yet not to the extent of murder. These altercations over segregation occurred over restaurants, railroads, and restrooms, among other locations. ","What set this story apart was the response to Kempin's murder. Whites paid little attention to Kempin's actual fate, but concerned themselves greatly over the soldiers' response to his death. The thought that a large group of black men would wreak havoc upon the city worried many of the citizens as evidenced by the paper printing a story about the potential riot. This imagined situation mirrored the whites' fear of slave revolts of the earlier part of the century. Because segregation prolonged the racist views of slavery, the idea of a violent uprising was still a great fear-especially since these were trained military men.

","Thus, when W.W. Price of the northern cotton house Hubbard, Price & Co. arrived in Jackson, Mississippi in 1891 in order to begin establishing a branch house in the city, he was not labeled a carpetbagger. Jackson, according to the Jackson Clarion Ledger, welcomed him in November of 1891, and claimed his enterprise will be of incalculable benefit to the community at large. White southerners, in the words of Richard Nelson Current, were no longer suspicious of Northerners who went south...[to] get rich by plundering the Southern people. They no longer feared negro rule; although black politician Hiram Revels stated, as reprinted by James Wilford Garner, that black voters during reconstruction had been used as mere tools to elect imprudent [and corrupt] men who called themselves Republicans, after 1890, they were no longer used at all. The chivalrous (?) [sic] white Democrats, according to the Cleveland Gazette, were therefore quite content.","Blacks of Mississippi and of the nation as a whole, however, were not pleased. The Atlantic Monthly noted by 1892 that The Fifteenth Amendment is disregarded [in Mississippi] where it is not nullified on the face of the state law.

The suppression of the negro vote, wherever such a step is necessary to secure control of the government by the whites, is winked at, if not applauded.

Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize.

Macon authorities originally sought Gibson out for a suspected assault on a white female that occurred earlier in the week. The manhunt intensified after he reportedly shot and killed another man during an argument on the morning of the 12th. After a drawn-out chase and multiple shootouts, Gibson was finally apprehended by the police that evening. However, Gibson's life was then placed in the hands of the public instead of being sent to jail. In a momentary absence of the sheriff and deputies, the growing mob of concerned citizens seized Gibson and hanged him from a tree, protecting the city from any more of his wrongdoings.","At the turn of the twentieth century, race relations worsened as racial violence became the most common form of interracial relations. Crime increased during this period which in turn caused people's responses to crime to grow more severe. Lynching became a popular way for whites to threaten and maintain justice over black suspects and criminals. Rural areas with little law enforcement, and areas with transient populations, were subjected to the most lynchings in the South. Georgia housed both of these types of places, where there was an average of ten lynchings per year.","This lynching was just one of the many rape-inspired attacks that occurred in the South. Over 60 percent of the lynchings of black men corresponded to an alleged sexual assault against a white woman. A third of those also involved mutilation and castration of the offender. The pretense for this common occurrence was the need to preserve the honor of whites. The code of honor in the South was heavily adhered to by white men at the time. This involved carrying out the duty to protect and uphold the honor of the women of their race and defending against black men who would denigrate that dignity. Any relations between a black man and a white woman were seen as immoral and a threat to white male dominance in the area. White men viewed the relations as the blacks' infiltration into white's territory and property and took whatever means necessary to protect it. Lynching was the most drastic and public manner in which white men could reassert their power and status in the racial hierarchy of the South."],"display_date":"September 12, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-12","locations":[{"id":1553,"lat":32.8067094598,"lng":-83.6980226314,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2843,"title":"Paternalism and American Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-01-01","end_date":"1859-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While on her honeymoon, Mary Norcott Bryan traveled throughout the South with her new husband. On vacation she went to Mobile, Alabama where she met up with her friend Edith Whitfield. Whitfield lived on the plantation of her father, General Nathan Whitfield. In writing about her experience, Bryan described the nearly 900 slaves on the plantation. In her observations, Bryan decided that the slaves were all happy and polite on the elaborate plantation with everything one could possibly desire. ","The description Bryan provided is emblematic of the overall belief in the South that slavery was the best thing for black people. In fact, many went so far as to say that enslaved people enjoyed and depended on slavery. Slavery was a relationship between masters and slaves and both parties benefited. Slaves received guidance while masters received happy and loyal workers. While Bryan was not the owner of 900 slaves, she believed as the Whitfields did that the slaves were better off with masters providing for them than on their own. Masters were patriarchs who protected their slaves who were simply inferior from birth. Bryan chose not elaborate too heavily on the condition of the slaves, but rather dismissed their happiness as normal. The Sambo stereotype of enslaved people implied that slaves were happy and good-natured in addition to lazy and ignorant. Bryan's observations fell inline with traditional southern views of blacks and therefore did not require any further explanation. ","In the minds of many slave holders, slaves were simply a part of white families and a responsibility for masters. An observation on the happiness of the slaves reflected more on the strength and character of the masters than the slaves themselves. Slaves were a symbol of status throughout the Deep South; the more slaves someone had, the more respected they were. Masters were not just judged solely on the quantity of slaves; a good master ensured that the slaves were productive and happy. While Bryan's casual observation initially seems trivial, she portrayed the traditional stereotype of enslaved people throughout the South. She also commented on the strength and character of her friends the Whitfields. Based on her description of numerous, happy slaves, one can assume that the Whitfields were of high status in Mobile, Alabama.

Little did the surrounding area know that they would be celebrating throughout their entire journey-in a destructive and fatal way. On March 8, 1899, the black men of the Tenth Immunes boarded their train with hidden firearms in tow. As the train started along, and began coming along stations, the men fired multitudes of shots out of the windows at each platform. The shootings became more wild and unpredictable as the soldiers got more and more intoxicated. Evidently they concealed more than just guns as they boarded the railway car. By the time they had left the Macon area, one sixteen-year-old boy's life had been claimed by the soldiers. The commotion reached its heights after it passed into the outskirts of Macon, where the mayor and the Governor had to call upon the militia and armed citizens in order to maintain peace and retaliate as the train passed into Griffin, Georgia. ","It seemed unreasonable for a group of men to go on a shooting rampage from their railcar undisturbed when people knew that they were the source. But railroads were among the first places in which segregation was accepted and implemented. Therefore, the soldiers were in a car to themselves. They were also in a second-class car, where smoking and spitting and other related activities were permitted. Therefore it was not seen as a problem when the men pulled out alcohol and started drinking, or brought out their firearms. It was not seen as extremely out of the ordinary.","The situation was perpetuated further by the soldiers' consumption of alcohol. The temperance movement was in full swing by this time, with many of the prominent organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance League, making their way into Georgia in the 1880s. In an effort to gain new supporters for the cause, this occurrence would have served as a headline story about the evils prompted by liquor. It had been consumed in public, caused political disruption, and killed an innocent boy. The real selling point of the incident was that blacks were the ones under the influence. The movement used blacks as a way to gain support, claiming that alcohol would make blacks, especially men, a greater danger than they were already assumed to be.

In an article in the Montgomery Advertiser the following Tuesday, the woman was excused from her decision to sit in a seat exactly suited to her mind with the dismissal that she knew no better, and probably had been told that she was as good as the whites, and entitled to as many privileges.

In recounting her story, Louisa Picquet discussed the races of slaves on several occasions. As a slave, Louisa recognized differences between herself and other slaves. She described herself as relatively white, but that other slaves around her where more white than she. She also noticed a difference in the way masters treated their perfectly white slaves and their jet black slaves. Masters preferred their slaves to be more white than black, though no matter how white a slave was, it was not good enough. For example, Louisa described her mother as pretty white; not white enough for white people. ","After describing race in Mobile from her perspective, Louisa described a particular situation on a plantation where her friend worked. A white and black slave both served as waitmen for their master. The master preferred the white slave and the black slave was jealous and plotted against him. He told his master that the white waitman had sexual relations with the almost-white female slave the master kept for his own. The jet black slave knew this was the only thing for which his master would beat the white slave. His assumptions were correct, and the white slave was heavily beaten and sold. The black slave knew that the only way he could gain favor was to charge the white waitman with a crime the master could not ignore. ","As Africans were shipped to the United States in greater numbers, race could no longer be simply white or black. Relationships between white masters and female slaves, or even in rare cases black freemen and white women, produced racial complexity. In fact, in Virginia there were as many as 61 different ways to describe skin tones. No matter how white a person appeared, if they had any African ancestors, they could be enslaved. However, the whiter a slave was, the more desirable they were to their masters. In the case Louisa described, this was true for both male and female slaves. In the female case, masters preferred whiter slaves for their own desires. With men, masters simply preferred keeping whiter slaves closer to them. This is a theme throughout the South as law makers and community members continually had to define what it meant to be white or black in a land where very few people could be definitively defined as one or the other."],"display_date":1861,"search_date":"1861-07-02","locations":[{"id":285,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2856,"title":"Jim Crows to the Senate-a White Mississippians&#39; Defense of Supremacy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-12-31","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On December 31, 1890, Senator James Z. George (D. Miss), a man Dunbar Rowland calls a life-long resident of Carroll County, began his overwhelmingly convincing speech on the Senate Floor defending the newly written Mississippi Constitution. The new constitution, according to Rowland's 1902 reflections, was drafted in order to eliminate ignorance at the ballot box, and Senator George's defense was apparently very insightful; he displayed a more intimate knowledge of the constitutions of Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut than did the Senators who represented those states, and the speech itself has been called one of the great constitutional law speeches of the Senate. Indeed, the principles that the man from Carroll laid out in his speech were subsequently validated by the United States Supreme Court in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. ","Two of the 1890 Mississippi Constitution's 285 main sections which George defended, however, have now earned historical renown: Sec. 243 establishing a uniform poll tax of two dollars, to be used in aid of the common schools, and for no other purpose, and Sec. 244 establishing a literacy test consisting of being able to read, understand, and interpret any section of the new Constitution. Although these two sections do not explicitly disenfranchise blacks and the provisions of the constitution of the State of Mississippi and the laws enacted to enforce them [were found in Williams v. Mississippi not to be] repugnant to the Fourteenth [and Fifteenth] Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the result was undoubtedly lopsided. According to William Alexander Mabry, the educational test if administered honestly [disenfranchised] about 123,334 Negroes and only 11,889 whites, leaving a white voting majority of more than 40,000 in the state instead of the existing 70,000 potential Negro majority, not to mention the fact that the Negro majority was already being repressed by bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Unfortunately, contrary to some of the official defenses of the 1890 constitution, including Senator George's, the result of disenfranchising a great number of blacks was intentional. As Rowland stated, the 1875 White Revolution in Mississippi and the subsequent years of intimidation of blacks leading up to the 1890 convention were carried out under the belief that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Even future early twentieth century Mississippi Governor James Kimble Vardaman noted, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, that there is no use to equivocate or lie about the matter. Mississippi's constitutional convention was held for no other purpose than to eliminate the nigger from politics; not the ignorant -- but the nigger. James George had fought since 1875 for this very purpose, and, despite claims of eliminating ignorance, it was in fact racial discrimination he defended before the U.S. Senate. ","Although the man from Carroll County's humble beginnings had earned him the nickname the Great Commoner, and his work in the United States Senate was valuable in aiding education and civil service reform as well as being instrumental in shaping the Sherman Antitrust Law, his staunch defense of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 left a darker legacy to the South. While he was very likely only a product of his time and environment, as well as a much larger underlying racial problem in the South and indeed the entire country, Senator James Z. George's rousing speech left what would become a permanent stain not only on the man from Carroll, but also on the entire South and United Sates as a whole, as it justified before Congress the Jim Crow system of de jure racial segregation and subjugation.

According to the Clarion Ledger Jackson had been selected as the site of the Mary Holmes school for the colored people, despite protests of many newspapers and citizens. They did not, however, formally attempt to stop the project, as it was, according to Samuel Rogal's account of Holmes' educational ministry, a only seminary founded by a white woman working with a white staff and a white faculty to educate young Black girls in the domestic arts. Thus, a service to consecrate the twenty acres of ground acquired for the seminary occurred at Jackson, Mississippi, on 24 December 1891 with no protest from the locals. The school officially opened on September 28, 1892, and was dedicated to Mary Emilie Holmes's mother on October 12 of that same year.","At first glance, establishing such a school seems to be an incredible achievement. Mary Holmes, who was trained first at Rockford Female Seminary and later at the University of Michigan and was the first woman to receive a doctorate in the earth sciences, had succeeded in establishing a school for black young women in the heart of the Deep South. After benefiting Swift Memorial College in Rogersville, Tennessee and Monticello Academy in southeastern Arkansas, despite resistance from white communities in the areas (especially in Tennessee), Holmes's commitment and mission to the education of black children, principally females, which she saw fit to channel through the missionary arms and agencies of the Presbyterian Church, had paid off for a third time. Not only that, but within only twenty-six months, Holmes and her father had enlisted the direct assistance of the Board of Missions for Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.; of local Home Missionary societies; of the Woman's Board of Home Missions in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and New York; of the Balck communities of Jackson; and of individual families in Rockford. It is no small wonder that whites in Jackson were not outraged at such an institution.","The reason for this, however, is that perhaps Mary Holmes's school was not such an achievement after all, as the curriculum emphasized courses of instruction in sewing, mending, cooking, laundry, and general housekeeping, almost [guaranteeing] that her charges would never rise beyond the various states of domestic service. Furthermore, it seems that Mary Emily [sic] Holmes...simply avoids the issue of racial segregation in the Deep South. She accepts it (although perhaps not agreeing with it) as a fact of life and goes about her business. Therefore, because she was not directly challenging the status quo, the whites of Jackson (and later West Point after the original establishment burned down in 1895) tolerated the existence of a school educating young black women.","Yet, Mary Holmes was indeed a pioneer and did in a way challenge the status quo. Mary Emily [sic] Holmes... stood above (or at least beyond) her generation of American educators by promoting the notion that education would certainly prove beneficial to every American Youngster, no matter what his or her social, economic, or racial classification. With this motivation, she attempted to teach young women something, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, that would lift them from the moral, mental, physical, and spiritual degradation which had been the background of the race for 250 years; through her Presbyterian missions and schools, she gave black women a reason to hope for something beyond the racial boundaries set for them by society, which was especially important in Mississippi. In this way, she attempted to fulfill in them her motto and her educational-evangelical mission: Not to seem, but to be."],"display_date":"November - December 1891","search_date":"1891-11-30","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2865,"title":"Slaves in the War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout southern history, masters continually feared that their slaves would rise up against them. When the Civil War broke, this was exacerbated by the fear that slaves would join the Union army. Louis Hughes was a slave from Mississippi. As the war progressed, Union armies came closer and closer to his hometown until ultimately they came through and destroyed Panola. Masters feared for their lives and their property and decided to send some of their slaves further south and away from the Yankees. Hughes and his wife were part of a group initially sent to Georgia. Once in Atlanta, Hughes and his wife were transferred again, this time to Mobile, Alabama. In Mobile, Hughes was sent to the salt works. There he worked for the rebel government, while his wife worked as a cook in the same factory. Salt was essential for preserving meat, and thus Hughes and his wife were forced to play a critical role in aiding the southern military effort. ","In 1863, it became legal for the Union army to use black troops. While this included freed blacks, Northern troops also enlisted runaways who offered their service. For blacks, this was a way of guaranteeing freedom and showing patriotism. Clearly southerners feared this. They accused Lincoln of inciting slave rebellions and violating laws of war.

The lynchers, according to the newspaper, would never be prosecuted. On March 27 of the previous year, the same newspaper reported that levee cutters would be properly cared for by the citizens of Bolivar county, as ropes and trees are plentiful up there. Thus it seems that lynching, for American Southerners, was simply an every-day fact of life; according to the Cleveland Gazette, the man in lynched in Texas was just one of 235 that year. Judging by later statistics, a proportionally large amount of those most likely occurred in Mississippi. ","Many if not all of those 235 lynching victims in 1891 were blacks, as African Americans were often the targets of lynch mobs . As the first blurb points out, it was common for whites of the South (and indirectly, by their indifference, the North) to simply let mob justice take its course, in order to, according to Michael Pfeifer, supposedly serve the purposes of local elites and other whites in relieving both economic and sexual anxieties. As white men saw it, the most overt kinds of opposition to their supremacy were frequently represented in these two forms. (Later, according to the Cleveland Gazette, white women of the south would take the take the charge in putting a stop to this mentality and to lynching). Thus the tensions in the South leading to lynchings were deeper simply skin color, although, according to Philip Dray, it was because of skin color that the accusations against those being sought out for lynching were often amplified and exaggerated by individuals in order to incite mobs.","During the late 1800s, according to Johnathan Markovitz, lynchings were carefully designed to convey to black persons in this country that they had no power and nothing else whites were obligated to respect. They were, in other words, used as measures of intimidation in order to prolong a society of white supremacy. Often, mobs of whites would turn lynchings into violent public spectacles, punishing one or two blacks to supposedly, as put by a Mayor of New Orleans, cause the others [to] trouble you no more.","Not all whites supported lynch mobs, however. Governor Hogg certainly did not appreciate the Law of the Mob. As Pfeifer points out, many others, such as Andrew Augustus Gunby, spoke out against lynchings and in support of law and order. They did so, however, often at the risk of their jobs and reputations, as Gunby blamed his stance on the lynching matter for his loss in the Democratic nomination for Congress from Louisiana's Fifth District in 1886. Additionally, Gunby, as many anti-lynching whites most likely did, spoke out in support of white supremacy; it is not as if he was anti-lynching because he believed in the equality of black men and women, he simply wanted the law to be upheld.","This is not the entire story of lynching in the South, however, as it seems things had changed by 1899. The Clarion Ledger, on September 14 and 21 of that year, published articles supporting the decision of the Governor McLaurin to call out the militia for the purpose of detering a lynch mob (an the militia followed his order), and lamenting the lynching of an innocent black man in Lawrence County, thus pointing out the wrongs of lynching. Although the paper still (somewhat paradoxically) supported lynching for rape, the evil [must] stop here. This seems to be, and is in a small way, a complete moral reversal of earlier values espoused by the paper (and supposedly therefore the average Mississippian). Unfortunately, there were some alternate motives.","Interestingly (and horribly) enough, economics played a large part in leading white supremacists to turn away from using lynching as a tool; according to Pfeifer, in the first decades of the twentieth century, an emerging urban bourgeoisie [in the South] wary of public disorder and threats to the accumulation of capital pressed for systematic legal methods for the sustenance of white supremacy. It seemed that by the early 1900s (and according to the Ledger, as early as 1899), the efforts of anti-lynching thinkers such as W.E.B. du Bois and Ida B. Wells, an African American woman who encouraged blacks to boycott, vote, and agitate against white oppressors were causing people everywhere to pay attention to what was happening in the South. Later, as Markovitz points out, efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (founded 1909) were paying off in bringing unwanted publicity to lynchings in the South, thereby threatening business by scaring off investors; influential white businessmen began to push more and more for writing white supremacy into law in order to legitimize the systems of white supremacy as well as maintain the flow of investments into the South. ","This is not to say that lynching stopped, however. The Cleveland Gazette reported episodes of lynchings in Mississippi into the 1920s. Furthermore, it seems white supremacy itself did not bother the aforementioned investors. Many across the country simply wanted to turn a blind eye to ways in which the system was being enforced. It's even questionable as to whether or not whites across the country objected to lynching as a process, as legal lynchings became popular in the early 1900s as a somehow more just and orderly answer to pure mob violence. Thus, it seems the September Ledger issues were merely protesting the evil of mob justice."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - December 31, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-03","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2873,"title":"Governor Mahone&#39;s Views on the Riot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-11-03","end_date":"1883-11-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On November 3, 1883, a black man refused to move off the sidewalk for a white man, and the ensuing violence caused a riot throughout the city of Danville as whites and blacks were attacked each other. One white man and five black men were killed. Each side blamed the other for starting the riot. Its repercussions sent shockwaves through the state of Virginia, especially with the November elections so close at hand. In response to the Danville riot, Governor William Mahone sent out a public statement on his views of the Danville riot. Mahone blamed the bourbon managers (referring to the bourbon democrats) for provoking the collision. He claimed the violence was done to intimidate black people and hurt the cause of his Readjuster Party. He explained how United States troops had been requested since the state militia was so biased against blacks in dealing with the violence. The statement was clearly political, as he blamed his political enemies for the violence. "," The late nineteenth century was plagued with political upheaval, especially in the South, as Southerners searched for a postbellum identity. The Readjuster Party was a third party that had an important influence in Virginia politics. The party gave substantial power to blacks and was based on equality for all. The party wanted to lift the state debt and therefore cut many civil service programs. It rejected the radicalism of both the Republicans and the Bourbon Democrats, who were an extreme wing of the Democrat that resisted the compromises that the Democrats were trying to make. With the November elections approaching, the violence in Danville was the result of frustration on the part of whites because of the increase political mobilization and power of blacks. The failure of a black man to show respect to a white man was the catalyst, and the violence caused the situation to spin out of control. This reaction of violence to the perceived arrogance of negroes was typical throughout the South, as the practice of lynching indicates. It also reflected an intense sense of honor that was prevalent throughout the South. Through violence, whites kept blacks in their place and protected a sense of order. Blacks were given little opportunity to express their grievances, since the law was so often on the side of whites.

The man was a tramp and when Davis approached the black man to ask what he was doing, the black man cursed Davis and attacked him with a knife. The cuts were not deep and Davis was not seriously injured. The black man escaped by running down the railroad tracks and away from Davis and other townspeople. Mr. Davis had no idea who the man was or what had provoked him to such a violent act. "," However, the next day the young son of George Burton was with a black man named Frederick Claytor. They decided to go tramping together, but Burton was appalled by the black man's behavior and reprimanded him for his repulsive acts. Heated words were exchanged and the Claytor pulled out a pistol and shot Burton in the shoulder. Claytor was arrested in Chesterfield County and was taken for examination to Justice Perkins. It was suspected that Claytor was the same man who had assaulted Mr. Davis, but Mr. Davis failed to show up at the jail to identify him. "," The judge's verdict in this case is unknown, but this case was important because it showed the fear that white's had towards blacks and the violence that some blacks showed to whites in retaliation for their inferior status in Southern society. Violence was a tool that whites used to establish the status quo and order within Southern society. However, when violence was used by blacks against whites, that social order was disrupted. As can be seen in this episode, black violence was portrayed as irrational and unpredictable. White anger was excusable, but black anger was disturbing and unjust. In many ways, this episode reflected the inferiority of blacks that many whites believed was inherent. While Claytor was a tramp, Burton only engaged in tramp-like activities. Black stereotypes were also enforced in this story, as social outcasts who were damaging to society. This distinction between blacks and whites was reflected in the paper and in the way that whites treated blacks.

As the white administrators of the Paris Mountain Water Company drafted new rules of their newly acquired waterworks, they established regulations to prevent or oppress most African Americans in their struggle for survival in the post-Reconstruction era southern United States. For example, as a newly reunited extended family set up sharecropping efforts near each other; naturally, the familial unit was tempted to use the same water service to promote the health and overall welfare of the group. However, as the white power-holders discovered any shared service, the water would be cut off and the amount paid for the service would not be returned. Then, the freed African Americans were stranded with no running water, creating further obstacles against their future success as freed men. "," As Emancipation gave freedom to the African-American population across the South, the Paris Mountain Water Company in a district of Greenville of the same name instituted indirectly oppressing rules on the use of water on November 1, 1899. According to Edward Ayers, areas across the South took pride in their new water works and functioning sewers. As modernization and technological advances made indoor plumbing possible, the white southerners in control of the waterworks industry used their position of power to prevent these health-promoting developments from benefiting those who could not manage to acquire them; furthermore, as the forced division of slave families were sometimes repaired in the years of the 1880s and 1890s, families, whether of blood or not, were formed as support systems in response to oppressive rules and regulations of the post-Bellum South, according to Wilbert Jenkins. "," Beneath the tensions crossing race lines in different utility regulations lies the perseverant tatters of slavery as the whites struggled to keep the increasing African-American population in check; therefore, while the water regulations indirectly limited the African-American populations of Paris Mountain in Greenville and limited their access to health promoting indoor plumbing, it also indicates the pattern of oppression that persists up until the 20th century.

The men included prominent clergymen, lawyers, bankers, and merchants of the city. They proceeded to march into the Negro Quarters to seize A.L. Manly's, editor of the Daily Record, printing office. They invaded the building, destroyed fixtures, and overturned kerosene lamps, starting a fire that spread and consumed the top floors. The news of the white mob quickly reached a cotton compress where approximately 300-400 African Americans were at work. These men immediately halted their work and went to the streets, creating mass chaos. It is unclear how trouble started but the whites opened fire on some African Americans on a street corner, killing three of them. Following that, the white men followed several other black men to their houses, dragging them into the streets, killing some and arresting others. By late afternoon, the twenty-five man committee marched to the City Hall and overturned the incumbent government, placing power entirely in the hands of the white Democratic Party. At the end of the day, white guards patrolled every street corner.","The tragic events of the day evolved out of the determination of white voters and taxpayers to take control of the city and county governments. The white Democrats had explicitly stated that they planned to manipulate the ballot boxes and enforce the resignation of the Republican Party from office and the removal of the republican county ticket, whether peacefully or by revolution if necessary. The day following the election, white citizens met under the leadership of Alfred Waddell and decided to take control of the entire city government, adopting resolutions that forced the Mayor and Chief of Police to resign and expelling A.L. Manly from Wilmington within twenty four hours. Manly had published an article in August denouncing white women in response to a speech given the previous year by a prominent Georgian woman where she condemned black men as white women's greatest danger. Manly's editorial rapidly became both a rallying point for white supremacists and a source of shame for African Americans. The committee had sent the orders of the resolution to prominent black leaders within the community and the directions told them to respond to Mr. Waddell by seven-thirty in the morning as to whether they would acquiesce with the removal of the printing press. Unfortunately, it was later discovered that they had mailed the response to Mr. Waddell in a letter that did reach the committee until three hours later than the designated time. In that letter, they had agreed to remove the press and expel Manly from the community, in addition to condemning his article.","In his study, David Cecelski agreed with other historians that Manly played a vital role in the Democratic and white supremacist victories in the election of 1898. Although, Cecelski concluded that Manly's article provided an excuse for the inevitable. In the wake of the growing black power, particularly in Wilmington, the Democrat machine had been advocating white supremacy and scheming to restore their political dominance for years. As neither the state nor the federal government stopped the rioting, the Wilmington Race Riot is the only successful violent overthrow of a local government in United States history. The newly elected Democrats immediately passed the first Jim Crow laws in North Carolina's history, reversing many of the rights that blacks had acquired since the Civil War. Following their election, 454 men signed a White Declaration of Independence stating that the framers of the Constitution never envisioned a franchised black population and declared that they would never again be ruled by African Americans."],"display_date":"November 10, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-10","locations":[{"id":9661,"lat":34.2953764793,"lng":-77.7420682293,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW HANOVER, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2881,"title":"George Henry White is Nominated for Republican Party Congressman \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-05-13","end_date":"1896-05-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 13, 1896, the Republican Party of the Second Congressional District nominated George Henry White, a black native of New Bern, North Carolina, for their delegate to Congress. He showed a masterful display of personal strength as he denied his brother-in-law, Henry Cheatham's, bid for a fifth straight nomination. John Fields had appointed a credentials committee that favored Cheatham, just as he had done in 1894, although this time Fields would not actually serve on the committee but rather was the chairman. White came from behind to prevent the Field's second attempt to fix the credentials process in favor of Cheatham. The convention lasted until around one o'clock in the morning when delegates overwhelmingly nominated White as their choice. Although White would face an experienced incumbent Democrat in the fall, the spring of 1896 Republican convention was the first one since 1890 to exhibit Republican unity.","White had gained the respect that put him in the position to be elected because of his dedicated service as the Solicitor since 1886. He was elected to the United States Congress in the elections of 1896 over incumbent Frederick A. Woodard and was again elected by the Second District in 1898. Although the Republican Party increasingly garnered a label as the black party and Democrats charged white Republicans as traitors to their race, White quickly became almost as popular in his party outside the state as he was at home in North Carolina. After the disputed 1894 elections, the state enacted changes which guaranteed the protection of minority voters and produced a voter turnout of more than 85% of all eligible voters in North Carolina, including an estimated 87% of black voters. In total, there was an estimated 330,000 votes cast, a 20% increase from the 1892 elections and the Republicans and Populists carried the state in all but one congressional district. Unfortunately, this trend would not hold in North Carolina and throughout the South.","White's nomination and later election to Congress was significant as it occurred in the face of a growing movement toward the disfranchisement of blacks. He was the last black Congressman elected in the South but chose against seeking a third term in the elections of 1900 as the North Carolina Democrats changed the laws, intimidating blacks from voting. After White, there were no African Americans elected to Congress for the next 28 years. Beginning in 1890, southern states invoked literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and white primaries to prevent many blacks from voting. Lynching and race riots also began to occur more frequently. In addition, in March 1891, the General Assembly decided to drastically redesign the North Carolina Second District, removing three black-majority counties, Jones, Vance, and Craven, from the Second District and redistributing them to areas dominated by the white Democrats. This forced White, a native of Craven County, to move to Edgecombe where he could once again run as a delegate for the Second District, the only district where he would have a chance of defeating a Democrat. Benjamin Justesen argued that in the face of this growing movement, the North Carolina elections of 1896 were significant because many considered them to be the state's fairest election since Reconstruction."],"display_date":"May 13, 1896","search_date":"1896-05-13","locations":[{"id":9436,"lat":35.9129129092,"lng":-77.5970968689,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2893,"title":"1843 Milledgeville Tax Ordinance Burdens Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1843-01-01","end_date":"1843-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In August of 1843, the city of Milledgeville, GA published an ordinance announcing new tax rates that had been issued for the purpose of extinguishing the indebtedness incurred during past years. Taxable property included land, houses, stock, inventory, modes of transportation, entertainers, and luxury items, but the list also included various classes of people. White men, free black men and women, and enslaved men and women that [exercised] the privileges of free persons of color were taxed. Slaveholders paid taxes on their slaves as well. Higher taxes were levied on the more valuable slave demographics, especially men between the ages of sixteen and sixty. Free black men of the same working-age demographic had the highest tax of any of these groups. ","Notably, the two to four dollar tax on white men was listed as commutation for patrol and road and street duties, but no explanation was given for the levies on other populations. Taxes on slaveholdings resulted from their being legally considered property and taxed as such, analogous to the taxation of stock, inventory, horses and wagons also listed in the ordinance. The slave demographics were specified because age and gender affected a slave's economic value. ","Milledgeville taxation was a standard practice, and the 1843 levies increased because of an economic depression between 1841 and 1843. The taxation of free blacks, however, suggests that taxation was not solely for the purpose of funding municipal activities. Free blacks were not 'property,' and in Milledgeville they did not have to pay as many duties as white men, perhaps because they were not considered privy to the same civic securities. Instead, these taxes served a regulatory function; sometimes as high as sixteen dollars, the city's government hoped that even one or two taxes, if high enough, would force or persuade the free black population to leave the city. An additional fifty dollar tax was levied on free African Americans bold enough to move into the city. In spite of these efforts, Milledgeville remained a popular location for newly freed blacks who sought an alternative to the agricultural plantation work available in the country. ","This 'head tax' was commonly used in the South in order to discourage residency and, ideally, force free blacks to move from the area in question. In some areas of the South, the tax could also result in forced bondage; if taxes were not paid and there was no valuable property to be seized, the county could hire out the offender and force him or her to work off the debt, often for menial wages that resulted in months of involuntary labor. These taxes are only some of the ways in which free blacks were formally or informally discriminated against; between 1810 and 1822, free blacks were not allowed to live in Milledgeville at all, and even in 1843 they were required to present a certificate and bond for good behavior in addition to the tax. Such laws and regulations imply, as their creators intended, that living in the South as an African American involved very little freedom-even outside the legal bondage of slavery."],"display_date":1843,"search_date":"1843-07-02","locations":[{"id":1524,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2895,"title":"Human Property\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-01","end_date":"1833-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 1, 1833, when Charles Manigault moved slaves from another plantation he owned to Gowrie Plantation, several miles up stream from Savannah Georgia, he left neat columns of names to inventory his property, while at the same time, putting brackets around each slave family. Furthermore, next to each slave's name he wrote descriptions. Not physical descriptions but personality traits. Manigault deemed Jacob smart and intelligent and Plato he thought to be good and trusty; however, his praises stopped with Young John when he described him as lazy and Moses as slow and complaining. Manigault commented on his slaves' characters and personalities, not just their working abilities. He called Bob slow, honest, good. These traits have very little to do with work ethic and mostly with character."," It's not personal, it's business has become a mantra for much of the twentieth-century corporate world. Slave owners in the early nineteenth century, however, did not have the luxury of making that distinction because they were dealing with inherently personal things: humans. Charles Manigault displayed this fascinating balance between humanity and business in many of the records he kept of his plantation, as seen in these records. Slaveholders all had to navigate between the fact that their slaves were human and the fact that they were possessions. Many slaveholders did so by recognizing families and marriages within the plantation, by giving slaves measured freedom during their few days off, and by acknowledging such humanizing characteristics such as temperament and work ethic. Slaveholders did, however, repress this humanity in their slaves. They did so through whippings and constant verbal reminders to their slaves of their enslavement, and very few slaveholders to take familial ties into account when contemplating whether or not to sell a slave. "," This repression of enslaved people's humanity had two purposes. The first purpose was to keep slaves enslaved. By constantly suppressing their humanity and treating them as objects, many slaves learned to act as such, at least towards their masters. This deference and servility most likely made the day to day operations of the plantation far easier. The second purpose of the repression of humanity was for slaveholders' own consciences. Had slaveholders dwelled on the humanity of those people whom they were forcibly enslaving, slavery would not have continued. Instead slaveholders reduced their slaves to only partly human, seeing them as children they had to care for not humans they were enslaving. "," This paradox of understanding slaves' humanity as well as treating them as possessions applied to every slaveholder as well as to many non slaveholders who upheld this system of slavery and paternalism.

Because of rampant childhood diseases and absence of many other options of sustenance for infants, breastmilk played a vitally important role in the development of society and families. Many slaveholding women designated enslaved women to be wet nurses for the newly born white children. As Robert Mallard describes in his memoir, As a babe, I drew a part at least of my nourishment from the generous breasts of a colored foster mother. Growing up on a plantation in Georgia, Mallard was certainly one of many young children who were cared for primarily by slaves instead of his own parents. "," This use of enslaved women as wet nurses caused a great deal of debate among Southerners. Many slave holding women did not even see nursing their children as part of their normal responsibilities as mothers. Other women however did look upon this practice with a skeptical and critical eye. In one woman's judgment, 'that woman is but half a mother who does not suckle her own children'","Many southerners were disconcerted by this practice of allowing an enslaved woman to be the primary care taker, however, Mallard felt quite differently. He wrote that his colored foster mother...always held a peculiar place in my regards. A black nurse taught me, it is probable, my first steps and first words, and was as proud of both performances as the happy mother herself. Mallard clearly has an ambiguous relationship with his wet nurse, as he shows by choosing the word peculiar to describe it. Enslaved women acting as wet nurses also had tenuous feelings toward their job as nurse. Most slave women who had children of their own were only allowed one or two months away from their duties before their masters required them to return to work, leaving their children with another slave. Being deprived of time with their own children, enslaved women must have resented time with their slave master's children. In Stephen V. Ash's book A Year in the South: 1865, he describes how Matilda Hughes, an enslaved woman, had to work so much that her twins died because she was unable to breastfeed them often enough. If enslaved women's children died of neglect, how must they have felt when asked to care for other children? But other historians have asserted that often, slave women caring for white children did form strong attachments with these children. This contradiction between motherhood and slavery lies at the heart of Mallard's narrative, and, though Mallard might have seen his childhood through rose colored glasses, this ambiguity unsettled the very core of the domestic household in the South."],"display_date":"1830 - 1835","search_date":"1832-12-31","locations":[{"id":1991,"lat":31.6671183532,"lng":-81.1853351386,"zoom":9,"place":"LIBERTY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2902,"title":"The Rising Sun of White Supremacy in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-06-15","end_date":"1898-06-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In his Baccalaureate address give on June 15, 1898 at South Carolina College in Columbia, George Herbert Sass gave a speech to his fellow graduating classmates early in the morning as the sun rose over the ceremony, which began early to avoid the humid, southern heat. Sass addressed the changing times as he discussed how a person is unable to choose whether an act reflects character or was the result of one's circumstances. He stressed unity in the future as his class matured and entered the world; he stressed unity as he said, And so we forgive and forget, and get along as well as we can with our neighbors, without going too far into the problem of their hidden characters. It is the wisest policy of all. Through this ignorance of surroundings, according to Sass, the class had to realize its powerless nature in regards to circumstance. As his speech progressed, Sass concentrated on the class? future by saying, ?it is not through the cultivation of the spirit of revolt and iconoclasm that this great end is to be attained. Not the breakers down, but the builders up, are the real helpers of humanity.? ","   In the speech, Sass touches on the concept of revolt in regards to a restoration of the antebellum South; in the post-Reconstruction era of the Jim Crow laws, this address incorporates a unique concept toward the increasing lines of binary division between the black and white races. According to Janette Thomas Greenwood, the 1890s set the stage for a white supremacist uprising in the South as concepts like Social Darwinism supported the biological superiority of the whites over the blacks as a whole. Sass? address stresses the importance of aid to humanity as a whole rather than revolt and negativity. Though he does not directly address the concept of racial superiority, he stresses both the focus of being a positive influence on humanity and the negativity of revolt, which directly relates to the deconstruction caused by the violence of white supremacists. ","   White supremacist groups, like the Ku Klux Klan, had used terrorist tactics in influencing the politically active blacks since 1866 across the South; moreover, the speech reflects the Southern tendency toward violence. Edward Ayers discusses how the time, being filled with political and economic conflict, following the Civil War yielded a volatile situation between the black and white populations. Sass addresses this concept as he pushes for the need of only personal judgment and strength of humanitarian acts rather than revolt to recall the strength of the Old South."],"display_date":"June 15, 1898","search_date":"1898-06-15","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2906,"title":"Black Police Marshal Uses Club on White Man and Gets Shot \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-09-23","end_date":"1895-09-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 23, 1895, a very large crowd gathered in Marion to watch the circus and ended up getting much more of a performance than they had bargained for. The weather was sweltering and dry and the crowd left the tent hot and sweaty. As the crowd walked outside to leave, they were greeted by the police force in addition to several special marshal reinforcements who had been appointed to help out for the day. Among these marshals were two or more black men, one of whom was Willis Tillman. As the crowd pushed its way out of the tent, Tillman became entangled with some white men and exercised his authority by hitting one or more of the men over the head with a heavy club. One of the white men struck, Huggins, attempted to run off and, glancing back to see Tillman pursuing him, turned around, pulled out a gun, and shot Tillman in the chest. As Huggins turned to flee, he was grabbed by two other black marshals who had come to Tillman's aid. Tillman again rushed at Huggins and began striking him repeatedly with the club while the other two marshals held him. He was then rushed to the hospital where it is unlikely that he survived as the pistol bullet was still lodged in his body. The marshals placed Huggins in jail where he also received careful surgical attention, although it is also unknown whether or not he survived the encounter.","At the center of this narrative is the continuing problem of race relations following the Civil War and Reconstruction. Incidents such as the one that occurred following the circus were characteristic of the constant clashes, sometimes violent, that occurred between blacks and whites in North Carolina. By 1895, although the blacks had received the freedom and opportunity to achieve certain esteemed jobs within the community, these jobs did not come with the respect from whites that they seemed to infer. North Carolina during the 1890s was a very hostile environment because whites believed that the blacks were trying to take over control of their government. Blacks had gained significant positions in both local and state government in the election of 1894. Authority exercised by any black man over any white man not only reminded the white southerners that they had lost the War and their property, but also that they had to live in an integrated society with these same people.","Huggins and Tillman's encounter reflects the increasing racial violence that occurred beginning in the 1890s in the South. In his book, Christopher Waldrup discussed the significance of boundaries in the nineteenth century southern society. He explained the developments of these boundaries and how they were constructed, contested, and violated as the uneasy relationship between race and law developed in the post-War South. The turn of the century brought race riots, widespread lynching, and killing of blacks throughout North Carolina and the Deep South. These episodes of interracial violence continued to occur throughout the twentieth century."],"display_date":"September 23, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-23","locations":[{"id":11594,"lat":34.220913684,"lng":-79.3699309097,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2908,"title":"Our Father, Who Art in Heaven","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-01-01","end_date":"1826-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Little Robert Anderson stuttered as he sat on the dirt floor of his slave cabin at his grandmother's feet. Over and over again, he painfully tried to recite the Lord's Prayer, but each time he failed. First, he could not remember how it began. After a hint from his grandmother, he ran into trouble with the latter parts. After many long, frustrating hours, his grandmother, with a pained expression on her face, tied Robert up by his hands and whipped his small back, all the while praying that her grandson would be able to memorize his prayer. "," Years later, Anderson recalled this event when writing his memoir. His account demonstrates the high premium some slaves placed on religion, because of the hope it offered. Anderson's grandmother clearly valued her grandson's learning the Lord's Prayer, if she was willing to whip him over it. "," Christianity offered enslaved people hope. The promise of a better life after this helped slaves defend themselves against the psychological horrors of being property. Anderson's grandmother obviously saw the necessity of this hope and was therefore to do whatever it took to give her grandson access to this hope. When Anderson finally did learn his prayer, though the necessity for this sense of hope was lost on such a young boy, he was, as glad as you ever saw a little fellow. After buying his freedom from his master, Anderson became a renowned and respected pastor, so this incident clearly shaped his life. "," This memorization was, in fact, quite disconcerting for slaveholders. Though most slaves in the South could not read, they did know several significant passages from the Bible, including the Lord's Prayer as well as other, not so innocuous (at least in the slaveholders' eyes), verses about freedom, equality, and the poor. By memorizing these verses, enslaved people combined the oral tradition of their African culture with the Christian religion they had been exposed to in America. This combination gave enslaved people hope and a way to constantly remind themselves of this hope.

The diversity of these intellectual societies is astounding, often catering to a single ethnic group. In Charleston during the mid-1800s, one could find the St. Andrew's Society for Scotch-Irish, the Hibernian Society or the St. Patrick Society for Catholic Irish (not to be confused with the Catholic French, who had the French Benevolent Society), the Hebrew Harmonic Society for Jews, the South Carolina Society for Huguenots, and the German Friendly Society for Germans. And for a while, even free blacks could participate in their own Clionian Debating Society. ","Still, white, Protestant males dominated the intellectual life in nineteenth century Charleston, often forming their own exclusive societies. One example was the Charleston Conversation Club. Founded in 1800, the club met in private homes during the season (typically November through May) where one member would make a speech, followed by a two-hour discussion, and concluding with a dinner. All the popular political and social issues were discussed, as well as the occasional foray into literature or history. For example, the first six topics in the 1854-1855 season were Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, poetry (written by a Society member), Parish Representation, political representation, Grayson's The Hireling and the Slave, and the destiny of negroes in the South. ","Such was the framework in 1855 when an accidental meeting of several gentleman, at one of those old homesteads, in the vicinity of Charleston occurred. The result, on June 2, was the creation of the South Carolina Historical Society and the approval of a constitution drafted by Dr. James Moultrie and Professors W. J. Rivers and F. A. Porcher. In 1856, the state of South Carolina incorporated the Society, and by 1857, the Society had secured the means to publish the first volume of The Collections of the Historical Society of South Carolina. The first volume was innocuous enough, including rather harmless topics like an address to the Society by Professor Porcher, a College of Charleston history professor. Yet by 1859 the conversations had changed drastically. In a May 19 oration to the Society-a speech reprinted in the third volume of the Collections-Second Vice President William Trescot took the opportunity to make a few remarks on the institution of slavery. Trescot's message was in line with most Southern thinkers of the day. Slavery was the great leveler, making a society of equals, by elevating all citizens of the State to the condition of a privileged class. It was an institution that knit together its members in their various conditions into one harmonious whole and made South Carolinians a grave, earnest, resolute, just people. ","This episode is important in highlighting the origins of ideas in the nineteenth century South: ordinary citizens, typical Charleston residents discussing typical Charleston issues among peers. In the words of historian Michael O'Brien, they were an urbane intelligentsia, not a workshop of experts. Their ideas were their own, though those often trickled down through newspapers and day-to-day conversation to ultimately reflect-as Trescot's did-opinions held by society at large. Ideas like his on the justness of slavery ultimately dominated the debates in all the aforementioned societies in Charleston during this time, and succeeded in casting a shadow over subsequent literary discussion."],"display_date":"June 2, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-02","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2914,"title":"While They Were Sleeping\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-08-21","end_date":"1831-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a Sunday night in mid-August, Joseph Travis slept peacefully next to his wife in the home they shared with their three children. The couple had just borne an infant, who that night was sleeping soundly, giving the parents a chance to rest undisturbed. The husband awoke to a sharp blow to his head, shot up out of bed, and called out to his wife. Mrs. Travis awoke to see her husband cut down with an axe and quickly shared his fate. The Travis family was the first of many families to meet an untimely end on the night leading into the morning of August 22, 1831. Nat Turner and a horde of other slaves and free blacks led a crusade against whites, which Turner claimed to be divinely inspired and mandated. He led the way with a dulled cutlass that acted as little more than a blunt piece of steal. At one point in the night, Turner was repeatedly unsuccessful in killing a woman with blows from this weapon, and resorted instead to bludgeons from a loosed fencepost. ","Turner soon gained notoriety among whites as a fanatic preacher who had used his tremendous powers of persuasion to garner his following; His confessor noted him as possessing tremendous mental acuity. He described himself being considered prophetic from an early age, destined for great things. These great things resulted to mutilated corpses strewn about Southampton County, chopped to pieces with axes, the tree fences and house top covered with buzzards preying on the carcasses. In total, the cohort murdered 55 that night.","Turner related the events of the night to Thomas R. Gray from his prison cell, as he was wrapped in rags and chains, a defeated man. He recounted the events with no remorse, but rather with excitement and religious fervor. In The Commonwealth vs. Nat Turner, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the stated charges of making insurrection, and plotting to take away the lives of divers free white persons, &c. He explained his plea of 'not guilty' on the grounds that he did not feel so. The common belief at the time was that Nat Turner and the rest of the slaves in Southampton County were like spoiled children who, given too much in youth, grew up to think themselves worthy to rule all they saw. This sentiment, reified by the Southampton Insurrection, led to more stringent laws toward both slaves and free blacks across the South. Memories of the Insurrection served as a reminder to the Slave South of the ever-present threat of slave uprising."],"display_date":"August 21, 1831 - August 22, 1831","search_date":"1831-08-21","locations":[{"id":14281,"lat":36.7198931687,"lng":-77.1037749414,"zoom":9,"place":"SOUTHAMPTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2924,"title":"Imposition of Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-08-01","end_date":"1839-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At the passing of John R. Rix of Raleigh, NC, eighteen of his slaves were freed from bondage on the condition that they boarded a ship sailing from Norfolk, VA to the west coast of Africa. One of the eighteen took a stand against these terms, and was resold into slavery. The idea for the resettlement of blacks in Africa began as a way for whites to rid themselves of African American presence to counterbalance ever increasing numbers of free blacks living on American soil. The public image that organizations such as the American Colonization Society presented was one of compassion and of Christian values. Soon it became clear that although there were pockets of blacks who looked positively on the idea of colonization, there were a great many others who questioned the professed philanthropy of its [white] promoters. Blacks who did support the movement often did so only when they decided whites would never allow them to claim full and equal citizenship. Many states, including Virginia, had instituted laws forcing freed slaves to exit the state; Furthermore, Georgia had created a system set on deterring blacks from immigrating to their state by giving free blacks the option of a 500 entrance fee or sale into slavery. ","It quickly became clear that Christian benevolence toward a debased and oppressed race was not the driving force for the movement, but rather a deep-seeded White fear of the growing free black population. John Rix's terms of manumission were not unique. The Colored American, a New York City-based African American newspaper, reported seven other conditionally freed slaves that were to join these seventeen on the ship Saluda, bound for Africa. The Norfolk Harbor was a microcosm of a nationally growing trend at this time. From 1820-1830, 1430 blacks boarded ships such as the Saluda bound for Liberia. In 1832 alone, that number rose to 1037-247 of which were manumitted under the condition of emigration. In this Land of the Free, the free people of color across the country were being pressured to leave their native soil. The blacks of Middletown, Connecticut, found themselves asking, Why should we leave this land, so dearly bought by the blood, groans and tears of our fathers?

There also were those in Richmond who were not especially found of the sale of slaves, especially when it broke up families. A sale of this magnitude however, was different. This was not selling off a single slave for disciplinary purposes. Nobody seemed to mind the mass sale of slaves, as Richmond was the largest upper South market for slave trading going south in the antebellum years. Unknown in this case, though, is whether all slaves were sold separately at the time of the sale, or if they were freely broken up and given to the highest bidder. Also, it is unclear as to why Spain was selling the enslaved peoples, for if he raised them all himself it would seem that he was not a slave trader by trade.

On December 6, 1850, William H. Barnwell, rector of St. Peter's Church, took the pulpit to expand upon the great political question which is agitating our country. The occasion? A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, as designated by the South Carolina legislature. The great political question? Slavery, especially in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, a compromise most South Carolinians viewed as an absolute defeat for the South. ","Barnwell was very clear on his stance: The purpose of the North is to use the whole power of the Government for its own aggrandizement, and the destruction of an institution which we believe to be of vital importance to our welfare. The institution for Barnwell, though, was not just important for South Carolina's welfare-it was ordained by God and a gift to the African race. His ultimate conclusion, though (the morality of slavery aside) remained political: Whatever speculative notions any one may have as to the moral influence of slavery, that it is a fundamental institution of the Southern States, and that no Government on earth has the slightest right to meddle with it, either directly or indirectly.","Turn to November 21, 1860. This time, South Carolina Governor William Gist had proclaimed another Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer. This time, it was Reverend Thomas Smyth lecturing at Second Presbyterian Church on The Sin and the Curse. This time, it was the election of Abraham Lincoln and a growing secession movement that prompted the occasion. It was all a foregone conclusion in Smyth's mind: This is only the result,-the consummation of a tragedy which has been long progressing to its last act,-when the curtain fell upon the dismembered body of the Union. He goes on to blame Northern Christians for this situation; they pervert truth, justice, honor, and good faith by forgetting that the condition of slavery has been and is recognized and regulated by God, who first ordained that it should come to pass as a penal infliction upon a guilty race, for the mitigation of greater evils, and for the good of all... that under the fostering care of these Southern States, and of this legally bounded institution, these people have multiplied in a ratio greater than their masters; that they are healthier and happier than any other laboring class on the face of the earth. ","This episode is important in showing the fusion of religion and politics in 1850s South Carolina. The views of these two pastors also aligned with those in the rest of the South. As Charles Iron of Elon University notes, By the 1830s, Southern whites insisted in their formulation of a regional, evangelical orthodoxy that God had ordained slavery and that slaveholders could confidently hold their property in persons so long as they were attentive to the spiritual condition of their slaves. Though these two sermons were ten years apart, the themes they espouse and the justifications for slavery they promulgate remained the same."],"display_date":"December 5, 1850 - November 21, 1860","search_date":"1855-11-28","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2931,"title":"Colonization Movement\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-12-19","end_date":"1836-12-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 19, 1836, Philo, an anonymous member of the Norfolk community, tried to spur popular support for the resettlement of blacks in Africa.

This plan, he said, was consistent with individual rights and the peace, happiness, and prosperity, of the free coloured race ... [and] promises contentment with social, moral and intellectual elevation to the emancipated negro.","Although this apparently concerned citizen claimed to have the best interests of blacks in mind, the interpretation that would be consonant with the attitude of American whites in this time period was that blacks were a problem and it was best to remove that problem altogether. As more and more slaves became citizens, whites increasingly took note. Successful free blacks posed a threat to the social hierarchy, specifically the institution of slavery. Much of White America, Philo included, took a paternalistic approach, using rhetoric of compassion in their approach to resettlement. Others fall in line with George Custis, who spouted, What right have the children of Africa to an homestead in the white man's country? ... Let the Atlantic billow heave its high and everlasting barrier between their country and ours. Let this fair land, which the white man won by his chivalry, which he has adorned by the arts and elegancies of polished life be kept sacred for his descendants untarnished by the footprint of him who hath ever been a slave.... ","Philip Slaughter described black people as fortunate to have encountered the white man, who had borne him along with him in his upward career, protecting his weakness and providing for his wants... In the meantime, the black man has been trained in the habits, manners and arts of civilized life, been taught the Christian religion, and been gradually rising in the intellectual and moral order, until he is far above his race in their native seats. This sort of attitude affected the African Americans' views of themselves in relation to the native Africans with whom they were to cohabitate. The repercussions of this forced emigration and assimilation into Liberia have stretched across the last two hundred years and are still present today in the civil wars that plague that nation.

A slave in this position identified only as Wyatt landed himself in jail after attempting repeatedly to be sold back to the plantation where his family resided. The current owners who had been trying to sell him wrote a letter to George W. Hamner, owner of Wyatt's family, informing him that Wyatt was for going off with you at all events - we therefore put him in jail - where we will keep him until we hear from you...we think he is too much a man of his own head to hire out anymore. They then proceeded to offer to sell him to Hamner for two thousand dollars, insisting that the considerably lower price (than the market value of 2,500) was due to their consideration for his family. ","The transparency of their facade of decency is quite apparent, however, by the following line now if you think you can give that sum for him please let us know it without delay as we intend to take him to another market soon. It is clear that the owners are businessmen and do not actually care deeply about Wyatt or his family. They even state that they wish to do everything that is reasonable without sacrificing too much on the negro. ","Walter Johnson discusses in-depth the callousness of slave traders in his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>. He writes that at the slave markets, consumers are often able to maintain a moral high ground in comparison to the traders, however misguided. However, in this example we see that even slave owners who are not engaged in the African slave trade often exhibit the same disregard for the needs or wants of their slaves. Thinly-veiled attempts at humane treatment are not enough to conceal the truly vicious nature of slavery. However, Johnson's book focuses mainly on New Orleans in the antebellum period, and this episode took place in Virginia in the midst of the Civil War. This may explain Wyatt's assertiveness - the Emancipation Proclamation had actually gone into affect four days earlier and many slaves pressed for their rights even when resentful masters and slave traders refused to grant them. In fact, in many states in the deeper South, slaves often did not even find out they had been emancipated until after the war ended. However, Virginia's proximity to the North and Washington, D.C. made it difficult for owners to conceal the news of emancipation.

Mitthoff had to run in front of the raging mule in order to protect his children, which resulted in a terrible injury to his foot.  ","Coinciding with Union occupation, the proportion of runaway slaves increased dramatically in Louisiana.  As soon as slaves figured out where they could go to attain freedom, they left their plantations whenever the opportunity arose.  Confederates knew that when Federal troops arrived they were bound to lose large numbers of slaves.  Therefore, practices monitoring and controlling slaves were magnified in order to prevent the huge loss of capital resulting from runaway slaves.  Parishes hired permanent guards and created river patrols to stop slaves from escaping.  Prior to the war slaves could live unaccompanied in cities, but once the Federal troops arrived masters were fined for allowing slaves to be on their own.  The state paid to have extra white men monitor plantations that did not have enough supervision.  There was also an increase in the amount of Negro hunters who were compensated for retrieving runaway slaves.  Confederates sensed the danger that Union troops brought to the system of slavery and did everything within their power to control the system they were willing to die for.  Not only would runaway slaves hinder the southern economic system, they also were likely to join the Union army.  Throughout the war the Union army took on many African-American soldiers who were fighting for their chance to be free."],"display_date":"May 21, 1862","search_date":"1862-05-21","locations":[{"id":5546,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2943,"title":"Denial of Serive\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-08-03","end_date":"1895-08-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Nearly twenty years earlier, the United States government ratified the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to alleviate some of the racial tensions still proliferated throughout the inner workings of society. During the summer months, it was common for families of all races to travel throughout the country for vacation and receive such hospitalities as refreshments and other accommodations. The businesses of the area would often provide services to people regardless of color or previous condition of servitude. However, this norm was altered on July 13, 1895. Robert Holland ventured into a private establishment of James F. Angle in Baltimore and requested service, dinner in particular. He was denied twice on the grounds of his color. An attendant stated, We don't serve colored people in here. An important aspect of the article is that they place Mr. Holland in high regard. The article mentions that he was a good looking colored man...of fine intelligence. So the action to deny service was not because the man seemed dangerous, but due to the fact that this particular owner had negative feelings toward members of the opposite race. Helping his cause, Mr. Holland did not react harshly, but exited quietly and immediately confer with a lawyer. This helps to demonstrate that social-cultural developments are still hindered by a superiority attitude of a few. The aggressive nature is making life in the new south an extremely difficult transition","Mr. Holland's experience on that day is a microcosm of the stereotypical South. Traveling was an integral part for it was a way from people to meet and connect with people from different places. All types from married blacks to educated and successful whites would converge at a city and be forced to interact and try to put aside their social and economic differences and be civil. However, it is ideal to assume that this could happen free from an occasional disturbance. Human emotions are entangled in Southern race relations, consisting of friendship and hatred. This mixture adds constant pressure on society. For the restaurant to deny service to Mr. Holland demonstrates how stress can lead to blatant acts of discrimination. Something so simple that we now take for granite was only privilege for some. Wilson noticed that the average black man at the time would have taken matters in his own hand. Thus, I believe that Wilson would commend Holland's decision not to take drastic measures but to seek a more formal complaint method. Allowing society to dwell on the discriminatory action and see the error in their ways.

By mentioning Cyrus's intelligence and the possibility of his escape by way of water, Wickham stated one of the possible ways for a slave to escape to freedom in the nineteenth century. If a slave could get to a boat, passage to the north would likely be much quicker than traveling at night by foot. Stowing away on a boat would allow a slave to hide and wait until arrival in the north, which was much more desirable than being in a constant chase with their masters.

The welcome that the workers recruited from California received when they stepped foot on the rich white Gay family's land was far from hospitable.  Moon-Ho Jung's <em>Coolies and Cane</em> frankly describes the scene: Gay's son Andrew, a planter himself, found the Chinese 'the queerest looking creatures he ever saw,' while his daughter 'laughed till she cried when they came stalking off the boat.'  These foreigners were received with a welcome of mocking disdain.  Gay's wife tried to fit the Chinese into her perception of the local racial structure.  She identified the Chinese as a mixture of mulatoe and Indian.  Edward Gay quickly tried to assimilate his new laborers into his plantation culture.  He gave them work clothes and sent them directly to work in the sugarcane fields.  The Chinese were only allowed to wear their Chinese dress on Sundays.  Just like slaves had been treated, these Chinese workers were stripped of their cultural dress the moment they arrived in Louisiana.  Although these were hired laborers, unlike African American slaves, they still faced similar repression in terms of expressing their specific culture traditions.","    Chinese laborers were gathered from California since agricultural labor was so scarce during Reconstruction in the plantation districts of Louisiana.  Many slaves had left the country or the South altogether, trying to shed its memories of bondage; others still just refused to do the same work they had been forced to do only a few years ago.  White workers often refused to take jobs formerly worked by slaves, as they felt such toil to be below them.  Therefore, with a large and continuously growing Chinese population in California, many plantation owners like Edward Gay looked to this other race to supply their need of labor.  As J.R. Tucker states in his article Race Progress in the United States, 75,132 of the 105,465 Chinese living in America in 1880 were located in California.  In addition, over 70,000 of the Chinese living in California were adult males who were prime candidates for the strenuous labor of the Louisiana cane fields.  ","Since labor prospects for post-Civil War Louisiana plantations were insufficient, owners looked to the growing Chinese population of California to assuage their problem.  Once the Chinese arrived in Louisiana, however, they faced prejudiced treatment that lingered from the recent times of slavery.  Racism was still deeply entrenched in many mindsets of the Louisiana Delta, and was reflected onto the unfamiliar Chinese the planters sought to exploit.

Hay described Manuel as broad shouldered and well formed, along with giving his height and other physical characteristics, his clothing, and his likely whereabouts (Northamberland, where he had bought Manuel in 1814). He also mentioned a mark on Manuel's head, given according to Hay, by a blow recently given him by one of his fellow servants. "," Hay's last sentence is interesting in two regards. One is that Hay went out of his way to state that the blow was given by a fellow servant. Whether or not this is true (it is entirely possible that Hay himself was responsible for the blow, as the physical abuse of slaves was prevalent), this wording was likely used to avoid a situation where another would find Manuel and take pity on him for being an abused slave. Secondly, he used the word servant to describe Manuel. Richmond (in comparison to other parts of the south) in the early 1800s was not an especially harsh environment for a slave or any African-American. Also, in other texts in the <em>Enquirer </em>this term is used for slave. Thus it is likely that some of the people were not in favor of slavery. By using the word servant as opposed to slave, Hay attempts to avoid bringing up the moral issue of slavery to those people whom he hopes will assist in returning his lost property."," Also interesting is that Hay posted this reward in the <em>Enquirer </em>multiple times (it shows up again on August 9, 12, 23, and 30). Fifty dollars was a substantial sum in 1815, one of the higher rewards offered for a runaway slave, and the fact that Hay would offer that type of reward, as well as continue to buy space in the newspaper to advertise this fact, shows how valuable a slave was for a white person.

For example, when Billy Pugh, a slave owned by the Overseers of the Poor of Norfolk County, was recommended for such a dispensation in December 1832, he was denied; This man had spent thirty years of his life raising several thousand dollars for the poor, and his only reward was the option to leave his home continent for Africa. Only three former slaves were permitted to stay in Virginia during the mid-1930s, all of whom were elderly and had provided significant service to the white population. The economy of Norfolk at this time was inextricably tied with slavery. Most enslaved men were considered semi-skilled or skilled workers, and the women filled scores of domestic positions. The shear numbers of slaves speak to how dependent upon slave labor the county was: In 1830, in a population of 9,814, slaves numbered 3,756, about 38 percent of the population.

Gooch wrote a letter in the winter of 1825 on the issue of slaveholding in Virginia and the South. Gooch believed that the subject of slaveholding states rights' was not getting enough attention from southern politicians. Throughout the letter Gooch argued against the intrusive interference of our northern neighbors on that of slaves, saying that they knew nothing of the cultural state of things among us [the South]. He also argued that there is little difference in the state of African-Americans in the north and the south, except that of political rights, which were hardly rights in the north. Slaves had better lives than their poor northern brethren, he stated. Gooch did not defend slavery's virtues in this letter; instead he argued against the north forcing its ways upon the south. He even stated that the southern states themselves are affording a devise gradually to get rid of the evil [slavery], but that they were doing it their way, on their time. At the end of his letter, he focused on the independence of Virginia as a state, and that as such the state has its own rights to run things the way it sees fit, under its own timetable."," In this letter much is seen about the way Virginians thought of the institution of slavery in the first half of the nineteenth century.

Gooch's statement that the northerners know nothing of the state of things in the south (and that slaves were better off than their northern counterparts) showed that southerners in Virginia honestly have believed that their institution of slavery was not in fact the evil it was made out to be. At the end of his letter, Gooch's emphasis on Virginia as a state and the rights that it thus had foreshadowed the Civil War that was still over thirty years away. The attitude that the northern states could not tell the southern states what to do, specifically with regard to slavery, would eventually be a key factor in dividing the country and leading to war. This would be very important in Virginia, a border state in the North-South conflict.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

The extension of new railroads into surrounding areas created a sense of nationalization of economic forces.

Conway identified the Northern Peabody Education Fund as the root of many problems public Louisiana schools were facing; in particular, Conway cited the Fund as responsible for having created the growing trend of white parents taking their children out of public schools.  Because the Peabody Fund's money explicitly provided assistance for free schools open to both black and white children, Conway could easily trace his problems back to the Fund's policy.  White parents in Louisiana increasingly refused to send their children to public schools that now allowed black children to attend.  Many white parents would rather remove their children from education altogether, or send them to private schools than have them attend classes with former slaves.  Because so many white parents would not allow their children to learn with African Americans, it seemed that African Americans were receiving a greater proportion of educational funding.  Feeling cheated, whites, with Conway leading them, attacked the Peabody Fund.  "," Therefore in December 1870, Dr. Barnas Sears, the general agent and administrator of the Peabody Fund, wrote a letter in response to Conway's complaints.  <em>The Farmer's Cabinet </em>reported on December 29, 1870 that Sears wrote to Conway: 'We [the Peabody Fund] ourselves raise no question about mixed schools.  We simply take the fact that the white children do not attend them without passing on the propriety or impropriety of their course.  We wish to promote universal education - to the whole community if possible.'  Sears was carrying out the mandate that the Peabody Fund had been established upon, that education for <em>all </em>children was the most essential aspect of trying to rebuild the war-torn South.   "," During Reconstruction in the South, black children were finally allowed to attend public schools.  The new Louisiana constitution, written by both white and black elected delegates, not only outlawed segregation in public schools but also required that every parish establish at least one school within its jurisdiction.  As Tunnell includes in his <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>,  a free African American delegate from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, who helped to write the new constitution, believed that these new provisions for education would elevate and enrich a Louisiana which had previously been ridden with both black and white ignorance and illiteracy.  However, in Louisiana, with a large African American population, this created major problems within the school system.  Since racism still afflicted Louisiana and the greater South, white parents often refused to send their children to school with African American children. The years of Reconstruction saw the rise of a great number of private schools across the South, as whites searched for alternatives to sending their children to school with African American children."," The complex tensions found within Southern society during Reconstruction are clearly shown in education.  The Northern money flowing into the devastated South was both needed and resented.  The disruption of the Southern social order as evidenced in changes within its system of education was a source of great conflict and attention during the Reconstruction era."],"display_date":"December 29, 1870","search_date":"1870-12-29","locations":[{"id":5547,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2971,"title":"Finding Utopia in Baldwin County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-11-01","end_date":"1894-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the summer of 1894 there was hope for a new way of life in the reconstruction of the South. E.B. Gaston took a group of people down to Baldwin County, Alabama on the Mobile Bay. A colony free from all forms of private monopoly, a colony where working people could come together to form a single-tax community was founded. Members of the Fairhope Industrial Association were all followers of economist Henry George, who asserted that the concentration of unearned wealth, or more specifically, wealth accumulated by rent tax, was the root cause of poverty. George's ideas were based on socialist tendencies but gained strength with the Populist movement in the United States. The members of the Fairhope Industrial Association could agree upon the ideals of a single-tax. They were searching to create a colony somewhere in the South, as most of the members were from the mid-western states such as Iowa and Illinois. The problem was finding a location where the Fairhope Single-Tax Colony could thrive. ","The Fairhope Committee presented their final findings after doing extensive field research in the Fairhope Courier, published out of Des Moines, Iowa, on August fifteenth of 1984. The publication's first episode examined potential spots to start a single tax colony, asking members of the Fairhope Industrial Association (assumed to be future colonists themselves) to vote. They visited locations in Tennessee, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama's Baldwin County and reviewed each extensively for their members to vote on. They reviewed agricultural conditions as well as social demographics. The report concluded the presence throughout the south of the black man is a serious drawback to its development, and furthermore suggested that the organization's members should favor lands with the least amount of Black people. They also reported on conditions such as soil type, climate, and geographic location. Three months later the colony was founded in Baldwin County Alabama, chosen for its favorable conditions described in the report: close proximity to the ocean and the bay as well as its fertile soil as well as its social demographics. It was named Fairhope. ","At the time movements with similar visions of social reform were taking place in the South. The Farmer's Alliance, one of the most important agricultural movements to ever come through Alabama, was gaining strength throughout the South, including places like Alabama and The Negro Alliance of farmers claimed 120,000 in 1891 and in 1889 claimed to have 50,000 members in Alabama alone. Eventually these groups became more and more divided on the issue of black membership and participation in politics. There is indication within the initial report published by the founders of Fairhope that they were aware of these issues in the South and wanted to avoid them by altogether avoiding black people in their community."],"display_date":"November 1894","search_date":"1894-11-15","locations":[{"id":17,"lat":30.2786488602,"lng":-87.5482936023,"zoom":9,"place":"BALDWIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2973,"title":"Mistaken Identity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-14","end_date":"1893-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mrs. M.A. Moore, widowed mother of seven grown children, was alone in her home one morning. As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount's claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent. However, their conclusion did little to sway Andy Blount's ultimate fate."],"display_date":"February 14, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-14","locations":[{"id":12056,"lat":35.2006308637,"lng":-85.2180291091,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2976,"title":"Mr. Vermillion got between me and my freedom, so I killed him.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-10-07","end_date":"1845-10-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The inhumane murder of James T. Vermillion by a runaway slave sparked a manhunt in Fairfax County.  The slave, owned by Mr. William Brawner of Prince William County, had not gotten very far when Mr. Vermillion caught him near his house, Pleasant Valley, in Fairfax County. Upon apprehending the runaway, Mr. Vermillion was going to take him to the magistrate for a proper conviction and return to his master, as in due process. The slave, having had a small taste of freedom, could not bear the thought of returning to slavery, prompting him to murder Mr. Vermillion in an attempt to escape yet again.  As this attempt was successful, the slave became both a runaway and a murderer. Whether the runaway was ever caught is unknown.  If he were, he undoubtedly would have been executed for his crimes.  Slaves had very little voice in the judicial system.  Even if the runaway killed Mr. Vermillion unintentionally the likelihood of his conviction and subsequent execution was very high. ","At the center of this narrative is the psychological damage that slavery had on slaves.  They were stripped down mentally and dehumanized in such a way, that freedom was their only real option to a harrowing real life.  This slave was not the only one who cracked under the constrictions and hardships of slavery, which worked to bolster white supremacy. In his book Soul by Soul, historian Walter Johnson makes the point that slaves were no more than commodities.  The process of dehumanization that took place to turn them into objects rather than people was both mentally and physically destructive.  In addition to this, the disciplining of slaves was rarely punishable in court, regardless of how severe.  Courts were even reluctant to chastise abusive slave owners as long as their behavior did not affect the community. Thus, slaves themselves could not charge their master with abuse; someone else in the community would have to bring the case to court. While this directly shows the how little the law represented it also gives insight into how harmful owners could be to their slaves without punishment.  These things combined provided the slaves with a lifestyle that not all could handle.

This degrading act of vigilante violence was initiated to control; mainly African-Americans in a predominantly white society. A response article was written to the African-American Ledger, a black operated newspaper in Baltimore, rebuking these despicable acts towards a fellow human being. A spark was ignited when earlier; two black men from a nearby county were hung according to mob law. Though the reasons for their death are not stated in the article, the readers would want to infer that the blacks committed some irreconcilable act. On the other hand, Brundage would assert that it really did not take a reason for some whites to be vigilant. Simply walking by, they were able to create a false reality, and persecute an innocent black on their reasons. Readers would moreover hope that the real judicial process was carried out to the fullest extent, free from rash actions of the victim's community. In reaction, Gov. Clarke condemned these acts and offered a maximum reward of 200 for information regarding those who commit lynchings.","It seems that toward the end of the 19th century, when lynching peaked, perhaps the public was becoming apprehensive with the course of society. Lynching was considered a solution to an increasingly integrated society. Whites felt that the growing crime rate in cities and towns were due to the renegade nature of the African-American community. To reconcile weak local governments, and preserve their way of life, a method was developed to punish those who crossed societal boundaries. This example explicitly illustrates the use of newspaper as a medium for citizens to voice their concern or contentment with these particularly brutal measures. As years progressed, more articles and debates were focused on this situation in the South. If modernization was ever to occur, the populace needed to recognize their error in their judgment to break the law in such an inhumane manner by tying a rope to a tree. More and more, progress was being made in the country with regards to technology and medicine. However, many believed that it was time for change to occur within the mindset of its citizenry. ","A more interesting question to ask is why would lynching become a predominant response to society's troubles? Due to weak institutional forces, poverty, and poor education, these factors instilled a superior attitude among whites. These sentiments thus failed to create a respect for law and fellow humans. Disgust was brewing among citizens for having to experience others tantalizing another race. The symbol was contradictory to the ideals of modernization and humanitarianism. There was a downfall of civil respect within the community, and this article exemplifies the necessary change that the South was beginning to recognize. The article states, ...he is anxious and desirous of seeing them improve and make progress in all that go to make a people whose aim should be to become enlightened and thus by a friendly spirit of emulation, advanced in the line of competition and ascend, if possible, along with the other races to higher frame and renowned pinnacle where glory should await all of God's children.

In Fluvanna County, a black man named William Holly stole the bacon and other property belonging to a white woman named Beverly Haden. Haden pressed charges for the offense, and the accused stood trial for his crimes, and was found guilty. After emancipation, trials involving free blacks in the South were often conducted carefully to avoid the possibility of being accused of any impropriety due to racial bias. ","When writing the report of the trial proceedings, Captain Frank P. Cranton, Attorney General Manager of that district, made sure to emphasize the complete fairness of the proceedings: The evidence and the prisoner's confession were strongly against him. The examination was fairly constructed. Colored evidence properly taken into consideration and every point of law contested in the prisoner's favor but his legal adviser Thomas H. Tuttwiler, one of the most responsible and best lawyers of the county. The proceedings throughout were conducted with all fairness, and no white citizen could have had a more impartial hearing. ","Often in cases of theft or other relatively minor infractions with recently freed blacks as the defendants a certain amount of condescending leniency was granted. The officers of the court regularly assumed that because of the short time that had passed since the defendant had even become a citizen, they could not be expected to be cognizant of the laws of the land. In her book <em>Dixie After the War</em>, Myrta Lockett Avery writes that The new manners of the blacks were painful, revolting, absurd. The freedman's misbehavior was to be condoned only by pity that accepted his inferiority as excuse. However condescending this attitude was, it may have had some merit, although it could just as easily be argued that even former slaves were aware that stealing was against the law. Either way, it definitely worked in the favor of the free blacks who stood trial.","This obsession with propriety and fairness was belied by the still-racist nature of the courts. In the document, Holly is identified as col'd (or colored), while Haden, a white woman, needed no racial identification at all. In his dissertation, James Douglas Smith writes about the sense of responsibility that whites in Virginia often felt towards freed blacks when it came to helping them navigate through the systems to which they had not been exposed prior to their freedom. Although this is of course not overwhelmingly true, as violence and racial tension comprised a large part of post-Civil War society all over the South, examples of white southerners displaying degrees of kindness, understanding, and paternalistic attitudes towards the newly-freed blacks can be found.

The hanging was in retaliation for the brutal murder of several white individuals around Greensville County, including the 1898 murder of Charles Wyatt, a storeowner from Portsmouth, Virginia. After escaping from jail in Portsmouth, O'Grady and Cotton terrorized Greensville County, executing robberies and the violent murder of a farmer. The duo was eventually captured in Norfolk and was sent to the Emporia jail.Several days later the growing mob of whites and blacks stormed the jail with chants of Lynch [Cotton] Hang [Cotton] String up the man who killed our friends Upon storming the jail, the mob pulled Cotton from his shackles and hanged him from the Cherry tree in the corner of the courthouse yard. After Cotton's lifeless body hung from the tree like a scarecrow blacks who had witnessed the lynching turned on the whites and demanded the subsequent lynching of O'Grady. You have lynched the Negro, now lynch the white man. The biracial crowd then turned on the jail pulling Mr. O'Grady from his cell and hanging him on the Cherry tree next to the lifeless body of Walter Cotton.The violent lynching of a black man for the murder of a successful white businessman such as Charles Wyatt was not uncommon at the end of the nineteenth century. However the lynching of Walter Cotton is one of the rare instances in southern history were the participants of the lynching were of both black and white racial identity. The hanging of the two brutal murders shows a brief glimpse of racial equity among the public opinion of the citizens. While the lynchings were influenced by mob hysteria, and against the efforts of police, the participants nonetheless engaged in a public tribunal that blamed both the white and black men guilt of the crime they had committed. Had the racially mixed crowed not demanded the hanging of Mr. O'Grady, then the events of that day would most likely been perceived as yet another incident of an angry white mob engaging in a racially motivated lynching of a black man. Despite being nearly forty years removed from the fall of slavery, violence towards blacks remained prevalent.

All African Americans had to have a written pass issued by the individual's owner or trustee. The office and the conductor both required a copy of it, and if the office was not familiar with the signature, the owner or trustee had to physically present themselves and prove that they had 'lawful control' over the individual.","Although Macon and Western specifically announced that they would enforce this policy, the practice of requiring blacks to have a pass was commonplace even off of the railroad. African Americans traveling without one were often arrested under the presumption that they were runaway slaves, and then bore the burden of proving that they were free or otherwise behaving lawfully.","The apparent purpose of the law was to deter slaves from running away and to catch those that were foolish enough to do so. Very few runaway slaves, however, actually attempted to use the railroads as a mode of transportation. If they did, they had to disguise themselves or successfully forge a pass in order to avoid being caught. Apprehended runaway slaves were severely punished and sometimes killed or sold to planters in the Deep South, where plantation conditions were even worse and escaping was nearly impossible. Because of the difficulties and risks involved, runaway slaves more frequently utilized hiding spaces in wagons, boats, and ships. Much of the traveling was done on foot through unpopulated fields and mountains where the risk of apprehension was lower.","The railroad companies and slaveholders were aware of this, and so it is likely that the real purpose of this policy was to deter free blacks from staying in the South, where their rights were severely limited and their freedom often questioned. Slave catchers were heavily compensated for capturing runaway slaves, and would often apprehend free blacks and even sell them back into slavery for the monetary rewards.

There must have been some interest in this scene, though, or else it would not have even been printed, especially in a New York publication.  Even more interesting is that this event refutes the general view of Reconstruction characterized by brutal white law enforcement.  Whites were usually believed to exercise complete control over African Americans who broke the law.  But, this instance clearly refutes this notion.  That the sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards were all African American is quite significant.  At least in St. James Parish, African Americans were afforded some autonomy in punishing criminals of their own race.  With a hierarchy that consisted entirely of African American officials, it can be concluded that not all Southern communities had solely white-dominated structures within the realm of law enforcement."," One explanation for this remarkable set-up of law officials can be found in Ted Tunnell's <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>.  New Orleans, the largest and most important city in Louisiana at this time, was only separated from St. James by one other parish.  This close proximity allowed ideas and practices to quickly reach neighboring localities.  Furthermore, between 1870 and 1872, with the reorganization of parish boundaries immediately outside the city, New Orleans' top officials were all Republicans.  This political control was greatly beneficial to African Americans.  Republicans were more sympathetic to African American needs than Democrats, and often provided them with the necessary help to secure positions of public office.  Whether or not these law enforcement officials were in office solely because of Republican political dominance in the area at this time, it is nonetheless noteworthy that these African American men were able to govern themselves in the face of harsh white backlash so soon after the war."],"display_date":"September 21, 1871","search_date":"1871-09-21","locations":[{"id":5681,"lat":30.0360710159,"lng":-90.7802066297,"zoom":10,"place":"ST JAMES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2986,"title":"All men are created equal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-12-11","end_date":"1893-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Religious faith and rhetoric dominated nearly every aspect of life for both blacks and whites following Reconstruction in the South. For them, God was an integral factor that offered life guidance in religious terms. Thus, if one failed to adhere to the principles upheld by their religion, they were condemned in religious and social regards. In 1893, Reverend W. Walker Jubb gave a sermon describing the good intentions yet incompetent act to initiate social equality programs in society. Prior to conversing about the subject of Rev. Jubb's sermons, some background is needed. Rev. Jubb of Fall River, Massachusetts preached to a congregation in Baltimore on Dec, 12, 1893. He began preaching in England, before coming to the states and advocating the differences in men are God's works which should not be overturned. In his sermon, he stated, Every man has his own allotted place in society...each class has an intimate relation to some other class, and all, according to the divine plan, are intended to work out the wise and beneficent purpose of the almighty.","This quote exemplifies the attitudes of conservative white southerners throughout the South during this time. For them, they believed that true religion did not allow the restructuring of society which was of divine order and that through a literal, fundamental interpretation of the Bible, allowed social institutions like slavery to exist and persist for centuries. Rev. Jubb, and members of his congregation, recognized that the religious ideas that have shaped their lives should be applied to political issues. Religion provides a measure of law and reform.","Many have recognized the influence that religion has had on political and social attitudes maintained throughout their institutions. Little reform to alleviate poverty and illiteracy among African-American communities were initiated in the south because of the public's contentment with inequality between whites and blacks. Rev. Jubb iterates, Education can give habits of mind, information, memory, power of attention. But can education give the instinctive eagle glance of genius. For many in the South, the answer to this would be an instantaneous, and probably, emphatic no. ","Moreover, this example of a cross between politics and religion, illustrates the importance of the church and religious leaders. The Church was able to serve social and political purposes. Individuals were unable to tackle these dilemmas single-handedly, therefore, the Church would convene to determine an appropriate solution. Morality suddenly fell within the grasps of the Church, and the individual thus lost the ability to rationalize by oneself. The Church had true power in the South, for whatever they ordained was subsequently followed. Charles Wilson made the statement, that even if the preachers were speaking about something meaningless or trivial, the people listened. The yielded mass support, with very little burden. Wilson also stated that they had the ability to become demigods if they fully supported the idea. The religious leaders were also important aspects following Reconstruction. When racial tensions were elevated, the public turned to these specific individuals to fight for their cause. Just like with Rev. Jubb, he defended the institutions presently at work within the South as being consistent with God's plans. He was a regional spokesman, however I believe that the ideals possessed by Rev. Jubb shows how the word of God can be deliberately altered to fit a political purpose. Christianity places extreme emphasis on equality and the fair treatment of one's fellow man. To be antagonistic towards blacks, disobeys the Word, thus is not Christian. A great writer at the time, William Faulkner, explicitly observes the South's attempt to alter religion during this time; I think that the trouble with Christianity is that we've never tried it yet. For if they did, would effortlessly determine that the rhetoric of people like Rev. Jubb as overtly wrong."],"display_date":"December 11, 1893","search_date":"1893-12-11","locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2987,"title":"Convict Standoff\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-07-13","end_date":"1886-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was already hot. As the Superintendent lined the convicts up to march back to the Dade County coal mines for another day of exhausting labor, one group refused to move. At the head of a long line of men chained together, the leader of the rebellion spoke up to Colonel Tower. He said that he and all the rest of the men from his stockade refused to work another day in the heat at their awful work. He defied the Superintendent to shoot them down- they were prisoners for life anyway and nothing could be worse than what they were set to do. ","Faced with such a situation, Colonel Tower immediately informed Governor McDaniel. Alarmed at the prospect of a rebellion and a breakdown in the convict lease system, Governor McDaniel ordered out the military and held them ready to intervene if necessary. After some consideration, Colonel Tower decided that the best way to control this outburst of Senator Joe Brown?s leased convicts was to starve them out. Feeling comfortable with the measures taken to guard the compound of stockades and with the presence of military backup, Tower put his method into action. Forty-eight hours later, the convicts were still without food, and the residents of nearby Cole City were fearful of vengeful attack. Colonel Tower stood by the stockade with the inmates inside all night. He tried persuasion and threats, keeping a conversation going with the convicts. By daybreak, the rebels were hungry-and a few of them were hungrier than the rest. These few decided that they wanted to surrender, that they had had enough. Their fellow convicts immediately set upon them physically, upset with their actions. Despite this show of force on the part of the rebellion?s leaders, the sentiments of the few soon spread to the rest. By the end of that day, all save one of the rebels had surrendered the cause. ","This episode is indicative of the perils of the southern convict lease system in the post-war period. As historian Mark Carleton notes, this plentiful source of cheap labor was irresistible to southern state governments with prison management problems. Indeed all southern states used the system after the 1870s. This episode indicates the support politicians gave the system because the leases were a source of state revenue at the same time as they eliminated the drain on the state to house and feed criminals. As evidenced in the protests of these convicts in Dade County, the workers were poorly fed and cared-for and suffered physical abuse by those overseeing their work. Carleton makes the point that as convicted criminals, no one was concerned for their well-being. Thus, when conditions became unbearable, they had to speak up for themselves. Indeed, the terrible conditions described by the convicts here appear to historians today to been a very like those under slavery in the antebellum south.

While this petty incident of crime was relatively unnoticed, buried in the middle of the paper, the style in which the brief story was written illustrates the social opinions in this southern city. The story goes on to describe how the black man acted in a deceitful and dishonest way to hide the pocketbook and claim that he knew nothing of robbery. When question for his theft, the man stated that it was his belief that the women had misplaced the pocketbook and that he had not taken it. However, the end result for the black man was the dismissal of his services: he is now minus a home.What is important about this incident is that it demonstrated the fears of whites about what free blacks would do to the order of white communities. Since the days of slavery, the majority of blacks were viewed as dangerous and uneducated. The fears of whites were constantly perpetuated by stories of criminal activity by blacks against white communities. Furthermore, the expanding economic and social influences of the black community intimidated many whites.The Atlanta Riots of 1906 showed this tension in full force. While many Southern cities forced the close interactions of free blacks and whites, the growing economic competition for jobs led to the boiling over of much aggression. Additionally, poverty played a large motive for crime in the poor Southern economies after the Civil War. Furthermore white women being taken advantage of by their black male servants was perhaps the greatest fear in regards to racially motivated crime. Consequently the article proclaims through subtle word usage that the black man is undeniably guilty despite the unsubstantiated evidence. While the goal of the Virginian-Pilot was predominantly to sell papers, it is clear why a newspaper would not attempt to seem biased toward blacks in their articles.  Just as white business owners viewed the loss of customers as a disincentive to hire blacks, so too did newspapers see the disincentive to positively reporting blacks.

Wiltberger, while sitting at breakfast one morning, was interrupted by his overseer. The overseer angrily informed Wiltberger that Jane, one of Wiltberger's slaves, was missing. Other slaves were being questioned but so far, the overseer could find out nothing. Incensed, Wiltberger questioned his slaves further, but to no avail. He then picked up his pen and proceeded to write an advertisement to the Argus, the Savannah newspaper, calling on all whites to help him regain his property. He offered a 50 reward for the capture of his slave. He described her as a Mulatto Female Slave, named JANE, about eighteen years of age-5 feet two or three inches high-stout and well made-a pleasing and intelligent countenance-long jet black hair. The ad first appeared on July 14, and two months later, was still being printed in every issue of the newspaper. "," Wiltberger's description of Jane does a great deal to reveal why Jane had been successful in evading capture thus far. First, he described her as mulatto meaning that she had lighter skin than most enslaved people. Often, potential slave buyers were hesitant to buy lighter skinned slaves because they had a better chance of successfully escaping. Also, once away, a lighter skinned African American would have a better chance of blending into white society. Wiltberger's ad and the length of time it stayed in the newspaper, both demonstrate the basis on which these fears were founded. Wiltberger also described her as having a pleasing and intelligent countenance. Because many white southerners associated whiteness with intelligence and blackness with ignorance, lighter skinned slaves proved more of a liability and a threat to slaveholders because they were thought to be more intelligent and thus more able to run away."," One of a slaveholder's biggest concerns when debating whether or not to buy a slave was if that slave would run away or not. Many For Sale ads in newspapers made a point of stating that the slave being advertised would never run away. This emphasis shows what a huge issue it was in slave society and the lengths to which a slaveholder would go to in order to regain his property. Jane might not have been perceived as such a huge liability initially, however, because of her gender. Seventy-five percent of runaways were male, simply because female slaves gave birth and had the responsibilities of motherhood so early in life. Jane, at age 18, might already have had children that she was abandoning in her bid for freedom. Her gender also, no doubt, helped in her success because a black woman was perceived as far less of a threat than a black man in the South; therefore, she would likely have had an easier time blending into a crowd. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether Jane got away, or whether Wiltberger's ad succeeded.

His illustrious military career included leading the Creeks against the British in the War of 1812, defeating the Upper Creek Indians against their Lower Creek foes in the Creek Civil War, and heading a national police force to continue the fight against the Upper Creeks.  Yet, these military conquests also created many enemies, especially among the Upper Creeks.","The final straw for the Upper Creeks was on February 12, 1825, when McIntosh, along with eight like-minded Lower Creek chiefs, signed the Treaty of Indian Springs relinquishing all of the Upper and Lower Creeks' land in Georgia for a sum of 400,000.  In retaliation for losing their land unjustly and because of their hatred for General McIntosh in general, 200 Upper Creek Indians set fire to McIntosh's plantation on April 30 and brutally murdered him in the process.  Little did the Upper Creeks know that they had also upset an entire state of white Georgians.","A few months later, editorialists in the northeast responded to the Creek's loss of land with disdain for the actions of the United States government.  On June 21, 1825, the <em>Southern Recorder</em> responded both to the actions of the Upper Creeks and the reaction of the Yankee editorialists furiously.  ","<em>The Recorder</em> began by mourning the fate of McIntosh, who, the paper claims, sacrificed his life for the Creek Indians.  In their view, he had devoted his life to the progress of his red brethren towards civilized life.  Sadly, their turbulence and treachery had rendered his cause unsuccessful.  ","<em>The Recorder</em> went on to find utmost fault in other newspapers that claimed that McIntosh sought to steal land for the United States from the Creeks by pushing them beyond the Mississippi River and leaving Georgia for the white man.  <em>The Recorder</em> editorialized that by defending the property rights of the Creeks, the eastern editorialists were also condoning the murder of their beloved McIntosh.  ","In fact, the <em>Recorder</em> argued, if the business [of aggression towards the Creeks] had been conducted more energetically on the part of the United States, McIntosh's murder could have been prevented.  In this way, the United States was actually doing the Creeks a favor by forcing the untutored and uncivilized Creeks off of their lands in Georgia.  The Creeks would have likely been better off if they had simply moved west unprovoked because they had no chance in their battles against their American foe.  An earlier withdrawal from Georgia without bloodshed would have saved thousands of Creek and American lives.","The focus of this narrative is the ongoing tension between American and Georgian expansionism against the territorial concerns of the Creek Indians.  Treaties between the Creeks and Georgia helped define the land struggles between the two peoples since late in the 1700s, but violence reigned supreme in the majority of the interactions between the two cultures.  The United States government, especially under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, violently forced the Creeks out of the state, all while hiding under a similar veil of concern for the Indians that the Recorder showed in this article.  ","The Creeks consistently refused the repeated requests from the United States government that their peoples move out of Georgia without the force of the United States military.  Although in a less organized fashion than that of the United States, the Creeks persisted to fight the Americans over the contested Georgia lands.  While McIntosh's death defined the Indian people to the Recorder, his murder only served as a highlighted event in ongoing strife between the Creeks and the American government over land claims that eventually led to the Trail of Tears and the near extermination of the Creek Indians."],"display_date":"June 21, 1825","search_date":"1825-06-21","locations":[{"id":1522,"lat":33.0721732643,"lng":-83.2584220033,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3025,"title":"A Religious Master&#39;s Desperate Decision\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-05-20","end_date":"1847-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 20, 1847, <em>The National Era</em> in Washington, D.C. contained an article concerning a surprising act of a man fro Prince George County, Maryland.

The late Townsend caused uproar in the county with his proposal being that all of his slaves were liberated upon his death, about 50 in total, and each deserved sections of land and other forms of property. Townsend also mandated that if any lawful objection arose, the slaves belonged to his nephew, Jeremiah Townsend, who was supposed to accept them for hire for one cent per year.

Accused of the crime were two white men, Sam Beale and James Brittle, and a colored man named Edward White. The September 7, 1899 issue of the Virginian-Pilot describes how the men are accused of the brutal bludgeoning of McDonald and then placing his body on train tracks. However the paper goes on to say that expert witnesses described how Patrick McDonald was murdered prior to be struck by the train.The collaborative efforts of the racial mixed attackers against the white tramp appear to have been senselessly carried out. While the newspaper fails to provide a motive for the crime, one can presume that the criminals had petty motives for the murder of this vagrant. Furthermore race appears not to be the driving factor behind the violence. Just as white and black indentured servants had relied on one another to escape from their owners prior to the Civil War, it appears that the white and black individuals relied on one another in the 1890's. The trust that must be present for the men to have jointly executed a crime must have strengthened the men's bond. In this situation it appears that a common socio-economic scenario for all the criminals served as a source of personal identification rather than race. Additional examples of random violence can be found within the black community. A September 30, 1891 article from the Norfolk Virginian describes the robbery of a black couple on an evening walk through the park. Upon being questioned by police, the black women described being held up by two black men. In this case both the robber and the victims were blacks. What is notable about these events is that random violence does not occur across set boundaries and follows no set patterns. This indicates that murder was not merely confined to the stereotypical perception of whites lynching blacks or blacks murdering whites. Rather as blacks began to assimilate into a predominantly white society, people began to look toward commonalities of social and economic status rather than skin color. Furthermore as additional exposure to blacks emerged and racial lines became more blurred, race was not always seen as the defining factor.

These refugees faced terrible conditions. First and foremost, leaving their homes and knowing that Union soldiers would take advantage of their possessions caused great psychological distress for fleeing Confederates. As city populations began to swell with the incoming refugees, resources like food and medicine, became harder and harder to come by. ","As a result of this chaos, refugee masters often lost much control over their slaves. Like their masters, slaves' lives were also turned upside down. Slave families were separated at higher rates because refugee masters only took those that were absolutely necessary. Everyday plantation life allowed the master to take on a role of extreme power, which was undermined while fleeing.

Sheriff Rogers of Jasper had in his custody the three men believed to be responsible for the murder: Floyd Woodlee, John Turner, and Cal Collins. In fact, Woodlee was the only man who confessed to the act. Sheriff Rogers was keeping the men in the county jail until such time as their trial could take place. However, a mob surrounded the jailhouse, demanding that the men be released to them. They were determined to get the men and to take them away, but the mob refrained from actually breaking into the jail with force. ","Sheriff Rogers went outside and stood among the crowd. He spoke to them calmly, rationally persuading them that justice was sure to take its course in the case. He quieted the mob with his speech and they eventually began to go home. The mob dispersed of its own accord, satisfied as it was that the three men would be found guilty and hanged anyway, with very little trouble to them. But the heat was not off. J.T. Simpson, a citizen of Jasper prognosticated that the black men would very likely be lynched, even over the protests of the sheriff, next time the mob assembled, if they were not found guilty of George Dawson's murder. ","This 1892 narrative seems to be an anomaly in the history of lynching in the South. That the local law enforcement prevented lynching in this case is particularly significant given that in this same year, the number of lynchings of black men across the south reached its peak- 155 men killed over the course of this one year. The scenario of the mob surrounding the jail, demanding that the offenders be released to them was common- if the suspected offenders even made it into the jailhouse alive. Some who study the phenomenon of lynching postulate that the practice became common around the turn of the century in the South because of weak social institutions, weak civic institutions, and ineffective law enforcement. They say that all these factors failed to develop sufficiently and so failed to instill in their communities a respect for the rule of law. However, we see in this episode a law enforcement agent standing up to the mob effectively, something that probably occurred rarely.

Wilkes wrote a letter to Reverend Iveson Lewis Brookes proposing that funds be raised to secure a new Baptist missionary to preach in Jones County, Georgia. Brookes was asked to continue paying 100 to sustain the preaching activities at his Jasper County plantation and to give an additional 100 to secure the second missionary. Wilkes, also a reverend, assured Brookes that another 300 would be provided by the Marion Board and general fundraising. Brookes was very active in Baptist affairs, and also owned hundreds of slaves and at least three plantations, including one in Jones County. He wrote a pamphlet arguing that the Bible served as justification for slavery, and presumably had a previous interest in procuring a preacher for his plantations. The money raised would be enough to procure the services of John H. Clark, an ordained minister living in the field, zealous, persevering, and energetic, whom Wilkes enthusiastically endorsed as the best candidate for the plantation job.","Preaching Christianity to slaves was a problematic endeavor. Although planters wanted their slaves to be Christian and to have eternal salvation from their sins, slavery was not easily reconciled with Christian notions of equality, and many feared that their slaves would become rebellious if they heard these messages. Reverend Brookes was, however, not alone in believing that slavery and religion could be reconciled. According to many slaveholders, Christianity not only supported the institution, but also strengthened it by teaching slaves the ideals of obedience and honesty, reducing the threat of rebellion. Southern missionaries also found themselves torn between their religious beliefs and condoning this peculiar institution. Many believed that slavery was wrong and ungodly and educated slaves when they could. Methodist and Baptist ministers also comprised a significant part of the southern abolitionist movement. Others argued that emancipation was insignificant compared to the need to preach salvation, and they thought that the anti-slavery approach had to be abandoned. Their primary goal was compromised when plantation owners banned missionary activities as a result of their abolitionist efforts. ","Tensions during the Southern Baptist Convention of 1845-seven months before Wilkes' letter was written-resulted in a split between the Northern and abolitionist missionaries and those who supported slavery or were at least willing to meet slave-owners' pro-slavery demands in order to gain access to the plantations. Methodist and Presbyterian organizations experienced a similar division. One result of this schism in the Baptist Church was the creation of a board for Domestic Missions in Marion, Alabama, which is probably the 'Marion Board' mentioned by Wilkes in his letter. A prominent figure in national Baptist politics, Reverend Brookes might have been one of the pro-slavery voices during the Convention meetings, but if not, he certainly supported their view. He saw these efforts realized when Baptist organizations began bringing missionaries to his own plantations in Georgia."],"display_date":"December 26, 1845","search_date":"1845-12-26","locations":[{"id":1967,"lat":33.0230529305,"lng":-83.5603964858,"zoom":9,"place":"JONES, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3062,"title":"More than Just Dancing at the Ball\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-01","end_date":"1862-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Every year the Fearn plantation threw a ball in honor of the magnitude of work that had been done the year prior. The slaves put much effort into the night to make it the happiest of times. Slaves on the plantation looked forward to the ball each year. This year the ball fell on a beautiful night. The Fearns were the last to leave for the ball. As they followed the path to get there, a large slave armed with knives approached Mr. Fearn. This slave had run away three months before to avoid the harsh demands of the sugar-grinding season. The plantation owner ordered the slave to put down his weapons. Out of respect for Mr. Fearns authority the slave fell to the owner's feet and begged to go to the ball. The master agreed to allow him to attend the ball, but warned he would be subject to the punishment by the other slaves. Upon entering the ball he was severely beaten by his fellow slaves and dragged from the ball.","Oftentimes runaway slaves were not punished directly by their owners. Many owners thought that runaways were just an inevitable part of slaveholding. Although slave escapes were a common occurrence, they did not cause much excitement. In fact an owner did not advertise that he had a runaway until that slave had been missing for several weeks. This composure about runaways was due to the fact that most slaves returned to the plantation because they could not bear to leave their families. It was assumed that a successful runaway would never return to the plantation he or she left and would leave his family forever. ","Family was one of the most treasured aspects of life for slaves. The Christmas season was the best time of the year for slaves because it enabled slaves to spend time with their families. Slaves were permitted to take a break from their grueling work to enjoy the holidays. On sugar plantations throughout Louisiana this leisure period was often pushed back until the end of January - after the grinding season. It was common that a dinner and a ball were held in honor of the slaves. Dancing was the most popular activity for the slaves. They danced long into the night. Fellow slaves played music and were sometimes able to make money doing so. Masters often gave their slaves gifts during the Christmas season and may have even given them passes to go where they pleased, within a certain distance, during the rest of their break. There were obvious limitations to the festivities that the slaves were able to enjoy, but it is clear that the Christmas season at least gave enslaved people something to look forward to each year."],"display_date":"April 1862","search_date":"1862-04-15","locations":[{"id":5562,"lat":29.3204554147,"lng":-90.0865534097,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3077,"title":"Black Witness\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-07-31","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The passing of Mrs. Lucinda Todd was not a surprise to her family, after all her health had been suffering for sometime. Though Mrs. Todd's passing initially appeared peaceful, the true happenings behind her death were revealed in the subsequent battle for ownership of Mrs. Todd's will. On July 31, 1897 Judge Burroughs resided over the court that was set to declare the official executer of Lucinda Todd's estate. The plaintiff, Mrs. Todd's daughter Josephine Sykes, had accused her brother, Mr. Charles H. Todd, by fraud and deceit....compelled his mother to convey to him by deeds, her entire estate worth ten thousand dollars. These are among the statements provided by the official court transcript when the case appeared to the Supreme Court of Appeals at Richmond. The court was given the task to divide the ten thousand dollar estate of Mrs. Todd, which included properties on Chapel Lane, Henry Street, and Bottimore Roads in Norfolk. What makes this case so intriguing however is the witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, Mrs. Sykes. Ms. Rachiel Crowell was close to Mrs. Todd in her final days. She had traveled to Norfolk to care for Mrs. Todd in the three weeks before she passed away. Ms. Rachiel Crowell was a black woman. Sitting on the court bench, Ms. Crowell answered questions regarding arguments between Charles Todd and Lucinda Todd. However what was important within the historical context was not the questions asked but rather the fact that a black woman was giving testimony against a white man. Prior to the end of the Civil War, blacks were unable to testify against whites. This often prevented enslaved blacks from defending themselves from unwarranted allegations and defending their family members. However the introduction of blacks to the civil and criminal cases allowed for black witnesses with valuable information to provide key witness information.In the case of Sykes vs. Todd, the testimony of Rachiel Crowell proved vital to the eventual conviction of Charles H. Todd. The altercation between Charles Todd and his mother Lucinda Todd was a key component of the courts decision to rule in Mrs. Sykes favor. While Crowell noted no physical abuse, she did take note of the vulgar language and aggressive manner in which Charles Todd approached his mother. The lasting implications of court cases such as Sykes vs. Todd include an increasingly equal legal system. Despite being too late to rectify the legal system in the pre war South, the post bellum era of legal equality as recognized under the fourteenth amendment provided the ability to improve the legal process.

Lewis Boyd, a black man, hopped up into the car to help unload the flour. As he removed the sacks of flour from the car, he happened to throw some of them to the ground. Conductor Shell reprimanded Boyd for his carelessness and Boyd took great offense. Boyd began to mutter and to curse the conductor out loud. Shell immediately responded, telling Boyd to stop. At this, Boyd snapped and he jumped onto Shell from the train car, hitting him on the head with a large stone. As Shell fell to the ground, Boyd hit him again and began kicking him. Other men working on the train rushed to the scene and restrained him. Boyd, seeing how badly Shell was hurt, ran for a nearby swampy area. However, the trainmen gave chase and brought him back. ","Meanwhile, word spread of what had happened. As Boyd was apprehended and brought back to town, a mob assembled, ready to kill Boyd for what he had done. The trainmen averted a lynching by hurrying Boyd off to the judge in Rogersville, who promptly threw Boyd in jail. At his trial, Boyd claimed Shell was the cause of the incident, that his actions were provoked. ","As railroads spread across the country in the period after the Civil War, they did more than just move goods for commerce from one place to another. They allowed people to move in, out, and around the south to a much greater degree than ever before. Thus, there were more unfamiliar faces- white and black- in towns where the railroad came. We don?t know if Boyd knew Shell personally, but it seems unlikely given the immediate hostility that arose between them on the day of the incident and given Boyd?s extreme actions. Historians have pointed out that these new social situations called for a more complex level of interaction than both white people and black people had been used to in the antebellum period. Indeed, race relations in these urban areas with people coming in and out were more impersonal and confrontational; thus a situation in which a railroad worker insulted a conductor and then attacked and severely injured him would be more likely to occur.

Indeed, attendants of the People's Party mass meeting in Thomson Friday, December 5, were deeply stirred as Pearson described his wife who requested that she wanted to give something to help Mr. Watson get his rights. Of course, the Mr. Watson whom Pearson's wife referenced in her last moments was none other than Thomas Watson - the darling of the Populist Party in his campaign for reelection to the House of Representatives. Pearson circled the gathered crowd and, recalling his wife's indelible devotion and enthusiasm for Mr. Watson, sought to invigorate the gathered members and inspire them to act likewise. A People's Party Paper correspondent covering the meeting wrote, It stirs very deeply, very, very deeply, when I think of this good old woman, lying in pain and in the awful shadow of death, and yet having her heart so full of zeal in the cause as to make her last act on earth a proof of her devotion to it, and her last message one of cheer to me. Following such an emotional appeal by Pearson, it is difficult to believe someone would be averse to working for such a man as a Mr. Watson and his populist cause, and yet opponents abounded in his reelection campaign.","What became of Joseph Pearson and his quest to fulfill his wife's dying wish is unknown; however, it may be said that his efforts were part-in-parcel of Watson's eventual reelection to the House of Representatives as a Populist in 1892. Not only was Watson one of the founders of Georgia's Populist Party, but he was also a brilliant orator and incredibly charismatic speaker. Both of these traits helped him climb the ranks of the Populist Party as he strove to unite agrarians across class lines and overcome racial divides. Later, he even advocated for the right of African American men to vote - a radical appeal for a Populist to make given the party's traditional base among white farmers. Unfortunately, Watson's early support for and among African Americans like Joseph Pearson soured after the failure of the Populist Party to fuse tickets with the Democrats in the elections of 1896 and 1898. Watson blamed minorities in the South for the Party's failures on the electoral field of battle and thenceforth transformed into a bitter racist. Watson had always harbored intense anti-Semite and anti-Catholic sentiments, but given his early support for African American rights, few could guess that he would eventually call for the reorganization of the Ku Klux Klan. Watson proceeded on to the national political stage as both a vice presidential candidate in 1896 and a presidential candidate in 1904. He failed, however, to receive enough support to elect him on either front. ","When Watson initially formed the Populist Party in Georgia, it appealed primarily to white farmers, due to its emphasis on agricultural protectionism in the South following low cotton prices in previous decades. On a more national level, the Party advocated for issues like free and unlimited coinage of silver, the abolition of national banks, a system of graduated income tax, public ownership of the railroads, steamship lines and telephone and telegraph systems, and direct election of United States Senators. Fierce competition from Democrats - who were still a viable force in the South at the time - demanded that the Populists appeal not only to the white populace in Georgia but also to African American Republicans. This initiative to attract the black vote obviously proved successful in the case of Pearson's deceased wife. Emotional appeals like Pearson's prove the overwhelming success of Watson in reaching out to the African American populace - an incredibly symbolic attempt which struck a strong chord among many and enabled him to claim bi-racial support on agrarian issues."],"display_date":"December 5, 1892","search_date":"1892-12-05","locations":[{"id":1819,"lat":34.426000328,"lng":-83.2423737095,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3086,"title":"Maryland&#39;s Desire to Establish a Decision\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-21","end_date":"1847-01-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The abolitionist movement began as a peaceful movement in the eyes of Marylanders, however, as they approached the goal of emancipation, many citizens question what their respective states would be like without the admittance of slavery.

Walsh and Fox said that for the time period, the primary establishment of slavery in Maryland remained because of the reliance on the tobacco culture in the southern region and the Eastern Shore.

Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

He proposed all men, both white and black, should be allowed to vote, but that those who owned property should have their vote count for more. Specifically, a man would receive an additional vote for each 500 worth of property he owned up to 5000. Thus, a wealthy man could have his vote count for ten times as much as a poor man's ballot. The stated purpose of this plan was to counteract the African American majority in South Carolina. As an analysis of the proposal states, the plan would wipe out the colored majority of 40,000 voters and insure a white majority of 20,000.

Once they were no longer under military occupation, white Southerners began looking for ways to reassert control over their society. Proposals such as these would eventually build up to the Supreme Court validation of segregation in Plessey v. Ferguson and decades of African American segregation under Jim Crow laws.

He again cites niggers when condemning the Populist movement to failure saying, The argument against the independent political movement in the South may be boiled down into one word - NIGGER.

This is not extraordinarily uncommon in the post-Civil War South. As Fairman walked the streets of Atlanta in 1892, he was likely confronted with new changes in the public sphere which were difficult to swallow for those accustomed to seeing African Americans working in the fields. Not only were African Americans given the right to vote - a hallowed white power stronghold - but in the period of Reconstruction from 1865-1877, African Americans also integrated into the social, legal, economic, and political systems in a variety of ways. ","Of course, Fairman's incredibly hostile and racist poetry is one of many responses to the empowerment of African Americans in Southern society during post-Civil War reconciliation. When Reconstruction concluded in 1877, the regime of Jim Crow assumed slavery's place, reigning over the South with institutions intended to disenfranchise and segregate African Americans from whites. The associated wave of repression and terrorism via lynchings and other forms of vigilante violence ensured that many African Americans were kept under the thumb of white supremacists. Fortunately, not all African Americans fell prey to white supremacists' power. Many were able to achieve progress and success during the Progressive Era despite several obstacles. For example, members of the middle class attempted to improve the conditions of their race through both social and charitable work as well as through education in several of the burgeoning African American universities like Tuskegee University and Atlanta University."],"display_date":"August 26, 1892","search_date":"1892-08-26","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3118,"title":"Mrs Elizabeth Crockett&#39;s Poisoning\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-06-01","end_date":"1821-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Elizabeth Crockett, a member of one of the most famous families in Tennessee, died of blood poisoning in 1821. On June 1, 1821, a special court, held in Clarksville, Montgomery County, charged two slaves owned by Mr. William Sullivan with having killed Elizabeth Crockett. According to The Watchman, a Tennessean newspaper: the court and jury were occupied until about eleven o'clock, on Thursday night, with the examination of the case. Travis, one of the two slaves was acquitted, for the want of sufficient proof. The following day, there was the trial of his son, Kinchen, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged on 8 June 1821. According to the journalist from The Watchman: The number of persons assembled to witness the scene was very great, not withstanding a heavy shower of rain, which commenced as soon as he was taken from jail and continued until near the time of execution.","Elizabeth Crockett's case shows how women, white and black, were vulnerable to the violence in the antebellum South. Indeed, being a member of a quite well-to-do family was not enough to be protected and it was sometimes a cause of their misfortune. As everywhere in the South, violence was part of the life of people in Tennessee, especially violence between different races. But Tennessee had to deal with lots of interactions between races, perhaps more than other states, notably because Tennessee was a frontier state with many Indian lands. It also had to deal with class cohabitation because there was a gap between rich planters and other Tennesseans. This is why violence was present in different ways in Tennessee: murder, robbery, revolts... The answer to this violence was justice: courts were enormously solicited, even for slaves such as in Elizabeth Crockett's case."],"display_date":"June 1, 1821 - June 30, 1821","search_date":"1821-06-15","locations":[{"id":12258,"lat":36.4871319194,"lng":-87.369253396,"zoom":10,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3132,"title":"Poisoning in the Hyde Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-21","end_date":"1841-07-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The entire Hyde family lay sick in bed and hoped that it was not their last hour. They had drunk their coffee and eaten breakfast as usual that morning, but began to feel ill soon afterwards. The shared pain made them wonder if someone had poisoned them. As it turned out, someone had slipped poisonous Jameson weed into their coffee. But who would do such a thing? That evening as the family recovered, the police arrested a black woman name Frances for the crime and planned to try her the next morning. ","Adolphus Sterne described this event in his diary on July 21, 1841. The only information Sterne gave about Frances was that she was a negro woman. This presumably meant that Frances was one of the Hyde family's household slaves, possibly a cook since she had access to their coffee. Frances's method of murder is significant as Joshua D. Rothman explains: In most cases, women were physically weaker than their owners. When they wished to harm a master or his family, arson or poisoning were more typical weapons of choice. True to Rothman's statement, Frances used poison as a way to injure her master and his family. Her physical limitations as a woman and the ease of obtaining poison and administering it made poisoning her preferred weapon. ","That their own household slave tried to murder them no doubt came as a shock to the Hyde family, and indeed upset many other white families in the area. When slaves rose up against their masters, regardless of the context in which they did so, they implicitly threatened all masters and all whites, observes Rothman. Frances's attempt set a dangerous precedent. If a slave woman could almost murder a family, what could a slave man, or worse a band of slave men do? Episodes like this created feelings of fear and distrust in the minds of slave owners. It also opened the way for other such crimes on the part of slaves. Thus the people had to act quickly on this matter. They planned to try Frances the very next day because they needed to show that they would not tolerate such undermining of a master's authority.

"," Many times when it became too dark to work, the slaves would go inside and start on the domestic chores. Millie Ann Smith, a Texan slave, owned by Master George Washington Trammell, vividly recalled her experience working on the plantation.

Crowded in the town's Temperance Hall, because of rain outside, Friday night witnessed the much anticipated literary and musical entertainment. Despite the weather, spirits remained high and prominent male and female speakers generated great joy and thunderous applause. The night's favorite performance came in the form of nine year old Mamie, whose solos left the audience shackled by their laughter. The enthusiasm for the temperance celebration surprised even the event's organizers; as the anniversary resulted in complete success. Despite no boring pleas for money, donations covered all the expenses. Sunday, April 24, celebrated by all the local churches as Temperance Day, witnessed mass meetings at several churches, with gripping sermons that kept people in their pews long past when the doxology and benediction normally concluded services. "," Protestant churches in the South regarded the coming of a New, commercial South in the late nineteenth century as a threat to the Old South culture, so deeply rooted in Christianity. Thus, local organizations, often supported by churches, emerged to improve and perfect an increasingly chaotic society. Movements towards Prohibition grew out of these efforts, which more often than not had a strong female presence. Such a seemingly Puritanical movement generated resistance from those who felt the church had overstepped its bounds. Nonetheless, some isolated communities, like Chincoteague Island, were able to construct their own local temperance options, though areas with a larger lower class typically encountered more resistance. "," On a national level, a prohibition party could never succeed due to the differences between temperance supporters in the North and South. Most Northern prohibitionists were Republicans and former abolitionists, anathema to self-respecting Southern elites. Within Virginia, however, the Prohibition Party increased by 1887 to ten times its support in 1884. These followers tended to see bars and saloons as the basis for the wrongs of Southern culture, fostering lewdness and incessant swearing. Oftentimes, the prohibitionists would reach out to blacks for several reasons. First, they were seen as important swing voters who could counteract the usually dominant Democratic Party. Also, there existed religious and class based reasons that white professionals could associate and share the same values with their black counterparts. This sort of mutual respect appears in a statement made by a white, pro-temperance preacher, Let us make a great pile of all the unreasonable race prejudices, all political animosities, all sectional bitterness, all partisan hate.... The most successful nation-wide coalition in the nineteenth century; however, came with the creation of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the first group formed by solely women to act politically. Nevertheless, no state encompassing prohibition laws emerged until later on in the 1900's. Yet, by 1887, Chincoteague rejoiced in finding what they considered a more perfect society.

In this year, the First African Church of New Orleans, which had been officially founded in October of 1826, received two new Baptist pastors after the death of its founding pastor. These Brethren Sanders and Satterfield breathed new life into the church with their worship leadership, and membership flourished once more. In 1837, Elder Peter W. Robert returned the now-Baptist organization to its original form by renaming it the First African Church. Pastors Sanders and Satterfield were ordained in First African Church and carried on preaching the gospel. The church was held in a schoolhouse, but as the church grew, so did weekly collections and therefore finances. By the year 1842 First African had enough money and members to move out of their schoolhouse building and into their own newly constructed church on the corner of Howard and Cypress. "," New Orleans was a city more focused on making money and socializing than worrying about its collective soul. Religious services in white churches were not highly attended. These slave owners kept a lose reign on their slaves in that regard, allowing them to go to church at their own leisure. Because of this bit of freedom, blacks in the area could converge, creating their own churches and organizational hierarchies as illustrated by Elder Peter W. Robert's success. This freedom was most strikingly illustrated by the fact that the First African Church was able to construct itself a new building out of its own money. Those funds had to come from somewhere, and they were probably not being donated by white benefactors. William Craft narrated the story of him and his wife's escape from bondage and included information about earning wages even as a slave. When he asked for a few days off work, his employer granted them, but the cabinet-maker with whom [he] worked ... said that he needed [his] services very much, and wished [him] to return as soon as the time granted was up. Some slaves, then, were able to perform extra labor for their masters or other entrepreneurs and earn a bit of money to call their own. Whites tended to grant slaves days of rest on weekends. The fact that slaves were willing to donate what little they had to churches like the First African Church is a testament to the strong backing and community feel that these religious organizations provided to their members.

Washington at the Atlanta Cotton Exposition on Wednesday, September 18, 1895. The talented representative of the negroes and President of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School spoke brilliantly and passionately as he lobbied for African American employment in the burgeoning industrial age. He called upon whites throughout the nation to recognize the burgeoning African American population and their subsequent need of employment in the great leap from slavery to freedom. African Americans had worked under the white yoke for years on end. Could whites yet again place their trust in African Americans to till their fields, plant their crops, and strengthen their business? Washington implored whites to reject the massive influx of immigrants as a source of labor. Why test the mettle of the Irish, Italian, and Eastern European, when a solid and trustworthy base of employment lay right under their nose? The crowd assembled to listen to his speech seized upon several points in Washington's speech, but the passage which best encapsulates his message follows:","To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were I permitted, I would repeat what I say to own race: 'cast down your bucket were you are.' Cast it down among 8,000,000 negroes whose habits you know, whose loyalty and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides. Cast down your buckets among these people who have without strikes and labor wards, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, built your railroads and cities and brought forth treasure form the bowels of the earth and helped make possible this magnificent presentation of the progress of the South. ","Applauded by both blacks and whites alike, Washington's address was one of the most poignant of the entire Convention and arguably in American history. Though some criticized his speech as accomodationist and pandering to the white population, it was still critical in guiding African American resistance to white discrimination and establishing Washington as one of the leading African American spokesmen in America. Ardent in his devotion to African American advancement and education, Washington continued his cooperation with white people, enlisting the support of wealthy philanthropists, to raise funds to establish and operate hundreds of small African American community schools and institutions of higher education.","Reverberations from Washtington's Atlanta Compromise Speech, as it was later called, continue to influence racial politics to this very day. The supposed accomodationist ideas of Washington were frequently juxtaposed with those of other African American leaders of the time. In particular, Frederick Douglass called upon African Americans to Agitate, Agitate, Agitate for social change whereas Washington stressed compliance and hardy work ethic. Washington's ideals also conflicted with other individuals like W.E.B. DuBois who supported the idea of a classical education among African-Americans rather than the industrial model which Washington favored. Both sides sought to define the best means to improve the conditions of the post-Civil War African-American community. Washington's advice to African-Americans was to compromise and accept segregation; however, this perspective incensed other activists like DuBois who labeled him The Great Accommodator."],"display_date":"September 18, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-18","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3202,"title":"The National Game\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-07-26","end_date":"1884-07-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Play Ball the Norfolk crowd shouted on a mid-July afternoon, despite the rain that would eventually force the Norfolks and the Baltimore Monumentals from the baseball field.

After the war, localities throughout the South began to embrace the game, at first in the cities, then by the 1880's and 1890's nearly every town had a team. This development occurred amidst a Southern embrace, in the late nineteenth century, of all kinds of sports; southerners of every class, race, and gender eagerly embraced sports and its trappings. Though the North appeared to, at first, monopolize the best talent, Southern baseball heroes quickly emerged, none more famous than the Georgian, Ty Cobb. Some critics of baseball even worried that a fascination with with such a game, better left to children, would hurt Southern culture. "," A Richmond newspaper spoke of baseball as, thoroughly democratic; leveling all ranks, and all social differences are forgotten, and sure enough, blacks and whites flocked to the game as both players and fans. In the 1880's games and grandstands were very much interracial; however, this phenomenon would quickly disappear in the 1890's. Along with other forms of discrimination sweeping the South during this decade, white teams no longer found it honorable to play black teams, leading the game to the segregation that it would finally overcome in the mid-twentieth century.

He owned the Staunton <em>Spectator</em> from 1856-1860. The <em>Spectator </em>reached many residents of Augusta County. He kept an extensive diary during his life, of which the years 1855-1865 are still preserved. On October 15, 1856, after having contemplated the hopeless Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and having acknowledged the local impact of national politics, Waddell thought of the assessment of his father's property, earlier that day and gave an estimate of his own possessions. Among those, he noted his printing office, stocks, bonds, two of his slaves, furniture, silverware, and a slew of other commodities, totaling to an understated 8700. His slaves Selena and Moses were mentioned in the middle of Waddell's list of property, but later on in the diary entry, Waddell alluded to a moment earlier in the day when a Dr. McGill offered 1000 for Selena. Waddell wrote that he would not have sold Selena for 20,000, unless she desired to go, or had grossly misbehaved. He continued to espouse his philosophy that, Speculating on human flesh is utterly horrible to me and he explained that he wished slavery were extinct, yet claimed to be no abolitionist and advocated that he lived in a time when emancipation was not prudent."," There was a socially accepted hypocrisy for the slaveholding Southerners. Slaveholders, like Waddell, separated the morality of slavery and the slave market. The slave market was a disgusting profit-driven business, owned by those merchants of disease and disorder slave traders. Historian Walter Johnson illuminates the contradiction that slaveholders could sell slaves as well, but believed that it was not with the intent of making a profit; there was always a noncommercial reason for selling a slave. This invisible line provided enough self-justification for slaveholders to shift the guilt of human exploitation onto those slave traders. Slaveholders were able to control and decide the actions of their slaves because they were property. The hypocrisy lies in the question, if slave traders only sold sub-human property, then why the disgust with slave traders? And if slave traders were trading people, not just property, than how could slaveholders justify owning people?

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual."," The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South."," Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

Anderson's book consisted of his telling of his earlier years living in Georgia and working for several banks and how the officers of the banks placed their utmost confidence in him as an employee.  Anderson's travels led him to the coastal area of Georgia where he arrived in Pooler, Georgia, and entered a local village with a black companion.  Anderson's main reason for visiting the town was to sell his book, therefore Anderson's friend wanted to introduce the reverend to his friends in the town, which included some white citizens.  After the two black companions investigated the town together, Anderson's friend introduced Anderson to his white group of friends.  And to Anderson's surprise, many people from the white group purchased his book.    ","Because the only source of revenue at Anderson's old age came from the sale of his book, the profit that he received from the sale pleased Anderson greatly.  But the gratification Anderson experienced did not come solely from the profit of the sale.   The reverend was truly pleased that a group of white southerners showed interest in his book.  Anderson believed the men bought his book only out of curiosity, yet the reason for the purchase mattered not to the author.  It satisfied Anderson just knowing that a group of white southerners were willing and wanted to buy a book written by a colored man.  Anderson saw his book as a way for both blacks and whites to realize that a black person was educated enough to write a book.  This event was not a unique one in Anderson's life.  The reverend, as a newly published author, would go on to sell many books in his travels in the North and South.  ","Robert Anderson's experience exemplifies how a black man felt about himself among whites.  Anderson knew he was an intelligent man and he wanted his ideas to be heard.  Many white people believed that black people did not have the capacity for intelligence and were inherently inferior.  Yet Anderson knew this idea of racial inferiority was not the case, and it thrilled him to have whites buy his book.

However, in September 1824, two little boys from a well-known family in the area, the Joshua Haskell's family, were accosted by a runaway slave on their way to school. He first spoke to them then grabbed their dinner-basket. Fortunately, he let them leave and the two little boys managed to arrive at school safe and sound. Even if the Jackson Gazette wrote it was a harmless robbery, this piece of news was considered significant enough to be the first one on the page who deals with Jackson news.","Nevertheless, such events were common in the South and especially in Tennessee where there was a large number of Slaves. Indeed, West Tennessee had the greatest concentration of slaves in the state, and Middle Tennessee, especially thanks to tobacco and grain cultivation, held the largest number of slaves throughout the antebellum period. Therefore, Jackson was at the core of the slave South. In consequence, Jackson could not avoid a recurrent phenomenon in the antebellum South: lots of slaves, because of their unbearable living conditions tried to run away from their owner's plantation and dreamt about freedom. However, after their evasion, they soon realized that their standard of living would be difficult to improve. Without job, without money, and sometimes with a family to feed, they sometimes became thieves and attacked people, simply in order to survive. Moreover, the time was one of outlawry and both travel and walks on the road were extremely dangerous activities. This is partly why many historians describe the antebellum South as a very violent place and also why southerners in the nineteenth century considered African American as dangerous people and believed cohabitation with them would be impossible (and unthinkable) without slavery because if they were free, they rebel against white people. This episode which mattered little in comparison with more significant events is therefore a proof of the difficult and dangerous condition of African American in the antebellum South, were they slaves working on a plantation, runaway slaves, or even free blacks.

This was the status of the Augusta jail one day after the attempted raid upon its confines by an angry mob of white men. The mob of 500 armed men had been intent on having their justice with William Robinson, an African American man accused of robbing and attempting to assault a white woman, Mrs. Minnie Walker. Hot with anger, the party of men assembled and then proceeded to storm the local jail last night at about one in the morning. The twenty policemen assigned to guard the jail refused the request for Robinson and defended the jail to the best of their ability. While they were successful in barring entry of the mob and the capture of Robinson, two of the police's corps fell in battle with the mob. As a precaution for possible repeat raids, the jail requested additional backup forces for the next few days and nights as courts tried Robinson. Ironically, several of the soldiers posted to guard the prison were apart of the lynching mob the previous night. In an effort to protect Robinson until proven guilty, the court system agreed to speed up the trial's start date. The grand jury assured the city populace that they would indict Robinson; however, the specific fate of the man was not as concrete. Normally, the courts reserved the death penalty for those who actually committed the act, but there was the slim possibility that that they might sentence Robinson to the death penalty based solely on intent. ","The fate of William Robinson is unknown. Did he receive a fair trial? Was he sentenced to death? Were the efforts of an impassioned lynch mob more successful a few days later when the soldiers returned to their normal stations? The Atlanta Constitution failed to provide a follow-up story in the weeks to come. However, one can hazard a guess as to the likely gruesome outcome of Robinson. If mobs did not seize him while he was in jail awaiting trial, there were plenty of opportunities to arrest the man and enact vigilante justice later on. In Georgia, lynching reached horrific heights from 1891-1899. Though Governor Candler agreed to send troops to protect Robinson and the guards of the jail in 1898, he cannot boast a consistent record, for just a year later, he failed to prevent the torrent of brutal lynchings which spread throughout Georgia. ","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans. In the Reconstruction Era South, lynching of African Americans was used, especially by the Ku Klux Klan, as a tool for reversing the social changes and enfranchisement of African Americans under Federal occupation. This type of racially-motivated lynching continued in the Jim Crow Era as a means of enforcing subservience and preventing economic competition. Although lynchings did occur prior to 1880, radical racism and mob violence peaked during the 1890's in a surge of terrorism that did not dissipate until well into the twentieth-century. Racism and popular mythology of the time created the image of the hyper-sexualized African American male who would rape pure and noble white women like Minnie Walker; however, historians find that in 80% of the cases, there were no sexual charges alleged, let alone proven. Lynch mobs assembled for petty offenses too. Stealing a cow, arguing with a white man, or attempting to register to vote were reason enough for many African Americans to hang in the eyes of the white South. The absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by every single individual in the South, but its pervasiveness throughout the region is telling of the fierce supremacist mentality which reached its height in Georgia in the 1890's.","<em>~ Colleen Elizabeth Laurence</em>"],"display_date":"November 3, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-03","locations":[{"id":2194,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3239,"title":"The Foundation of Tennessee Colonization Society and the First Freed Slaves to Leave Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-12-01","end_date":"1829-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In December 1829, Josiah F. Polk and Philip Lindsey created the Tennessee Colonization Society in Nashville. Polk and Lindsey's society was a branch of the American Colonization Society whose goal was to repatriate free slaves to Liberia in Africa. They started to try to convince free slaves to leave the United States as soon as the Society was created in 1829. If the slaves were not free, members of the Society met their owners and persuaded them to free their slaves and let them go to Africa. However, it was a difficult job and they did not really succeed; the society was not really efficient at the beginning (only 55 freed slaves from Tennessee went to Liberia before 1841).","Even if it was not a success at first, the creation of such an organization was significant for Nashville and for Tennessee. What should they do? Nobody agreed. Some wanted to abolish slavery; other said it was not possible. Sending freed slaves back to America apparently was a good solution for the people who believed freed slaves would not manage to leave in peace with other white Americans. However, Tennesseans were as idealistic as other Americans and they really believed it could work which means that, in spite of the great number of slaves in Tennessee, people were not aware that these slaves were often born in the United States and would like independency but on the American continent, although some of them volunteered to leave. For example, the African American newspaper Freedom's Journal, wrote about a colored minister who wrote he was ready, with his whole family but also a bit anxious to proceed.

The structure of society was changing around them, and many had trouble with the rising stature of blacks in society, even when it came to matters of national security. Raleigh Green, in a June 10, 1898 editorial, expressed his particular aggravation that white southern men were expected to salute African American officers. While Green recognized that all blacks were free, he continued to accept a central principle of slavery: blacks are inferior to whites. Green explained that respect for black officers was causing a great deal of unnecessary discussion with Spain. Green argued that any black officer who expected a southern white solder to salute him would be consistently disappointed. To solve this foolishness, Green explained that any black soldier who did not want to fight in the Spanish American war should go home. Green bluntly stated that black soldiers were vestigial to the American military; the American military did not need their services. He concluded his editorial by saying of qualified black soldiers, however we are glad to be able to express it as an opinion that such colored men here in the south are few and far between.","Racial tension in America was so strong it played a role in the Spanish-American war. When the Maine was sunk in 1898, President William McKinley was forced to move the nation into war. Some blacks saw this as an opportunity to advance their social position. Booker T. Washington proclaimed himself willing to take responsibility for recruiting soldiers who would gladly fight on behalf of the United States. Not all blacks saw war as a positive force. Some argued that the war was only arming the very people that abused African Americans. Others considered it ironic that blacks were fighting for the freedom of Cubans when blacks endured obstacles to their own freedom at home. Furthermore, some worried that the Spanish American war would serve as a distraction from these injustices. ","Although, Green told those blacks who didn't want to fight to go home, this was not a viable option. As Edward Ayers explains, any soldier who had been enlisted in the military long before 1898 had no choice but to fight in Cuba. Although many of these troops were courageous soldiers, they received little recognition. One sergeant explained it mattered not if we were soldiers of the United States, we were 'niggers' as they call us and they treated us with contempt. Many white citizens and newspapers made it clear that any black soldier stationed in their area would be expected to stay in their place. Blacks, however, were also clear that they demanded equality. In the end, however, Ayers concludes that the experience of the Spanish-American war, far from helping race relations in America, accelerated their decline.

By segregating the population, whites in Charleston were able to have one more realm of safety and dominance. Boundary Street was the Northern border of the city in 1816. While it was convenient because it was next to the Church, the fact that both the church blacks were able to attend and the burial ground they were allowed to purchase was on the outskirts of the city is significant.

Thus wrote the Chattanooga Times in reference to the lynching of an African American male in Georgia's Schley County Tuesday, February 12, 1889. Thousands of individuals gathered to participate in the brutal death of Blackman. Apparently, the Georgia Press vehemently condemned the actions of the lynch mob prompting the Chattanooga author to pen that such morbid anxiety to see a fellow creature strangled ought not to be allowed to again manifest itself in Georgia. The legislature should pass a law making executions private; and if they were to adopt the plan of executing all capital criminal within the walls of the penitentiary, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., that would be a still further improvement. Public hangings are a disgrace to civilization.","With a story like the one above in which every citizen of Schley County seemed to participate in the lynching of Blackman, it is difficult to conceive of anti-lynching campaigns. And yet the absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by everyone in the South. As the uproar by the Georgia press and the vehement opposition by the Chattanooga Times author demonstrates, opposition to lynching was a salient force. Despite the dangers of vocalizing an anti-lynching message, the movement grew from 1890 onward. Among the opposition, African American women were among the first to speak out. After all, it was often their husbands, brothers, sons, and friends who were wrongfully accused and lynched. Over time this assembly of African American women began to call upon their white counterparts to control the violence and lawlessness of white men. Unfortunately, their pleas and demands for intervention did not achieve fruition for several decades to come.","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans.

In his sermon, Rev. E. K. Love of the First  African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia advocated equality for all people, black and white. Fifteen hundred people attended the evening church service to hear the sermon given by Love. Love noted that the outrageous acts of lynching would not stop any time soon. Love professed that the best way to decrease occurrences of rape was to depend on the laws set forth in this country. He promoted the idea that all blacks should follow the law in order to dispel any preconceived notions that whites had concerning black people. Love believed his position on blacks obeying the law was the stance that all black Americans should take. At the end of the meeting the church as a whole took a vote and concluded that they endorsed Love's position as the overall position of the church. ","The threat of being hung from a noose scared many southern African Americans after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. Black southerners were hanged for any reason that whites determined to be a necessary cause such as the supposed killing of a white person or the raping of a white woman. Yet the hanging of a black person was not the only form of mob violence African Americans experienced. In 1899 in Palmetto, Georgia two thousand white men, women and children gathered to watch the lynching of Sam Hose who allegedly raped a white woman. The innocent black man was burned alive and his body parts were divided and sold as souvenirs. This tragic episode and many others occurred frequently throughout the South. The horrors associated with lynching and mob violence were at the center of Love's sermon. ","As the population of the United States increased at a rapid rate, whites and blacks began to live in close vicinity to one another in urban and rural areas. One result of the living situation in the rapidly growing United States included a fairly high frequency of lynching. The horrors of lynching became a topic of concern for both whites and blacks. The sermon given by Love denoted the importance of the issue of lynching throughout the South. The large amount of people that attended the sermon showed that many people had a great deal of interest in the subject.

On the second day of session, Mississippi Governor Charles Clark gave a speech on the Condition of the Country, in which he encouraged the state to stand with the Confederacy until the very end.

To create greater distance between the two, the Virginia state government decided to segregate railroad cars based on race. In 1900, the state of Virginia passed a law that mandated all railroad companies to furnish separate coaches for the transportation of white and blacks passengers. The law required that there be no difference in the quality, conveniences, and accommodations in the cars. The law further stated that passengers who refused to occupy their assigned car could be removed from the train. The law was met with great approval in many places including Alexandria, Virginia, and, in general, faced very little opposition. In Alexandria, whether the law would pass was not an issue. According to The Washington Post, Senator Mushbach and Delegate Bendheim, of this city (Alexandria), have not expressed themselves upon the subject but there is little doubt that both will vote for the measure when it comes up. Race segregation was a welcome institution in a region still nursing its wounds after the Civil War. ","The segregation of railroads was part of the development of the Jim Crow South. The railroad car law in 1900 was the first official law mandating segregation on trains. For thirty years after the Civil War, blacks and whites rode in the same railroad cars. Segregation, however, was not unprecedented. Charles Wynes explained that whites would force blacks to sit in the smoking car or a special car, although he conceded this behavior was erratic. The cause for such laws is unclear. It is clear that the laws were not a result of demanded segregation by whites. Instead, the laws were a result of the underlying racial bigotry that existed.

However, each year many divorce petitions were filed in the South. In 1857, Mrs. Charlotte Smith of Lowndes County, Mississippi stated that she caught her husband committing adultery with a negro girl named Nancy in April of that year. Mrs. Smith, devastated by her husband's crime, filed for divorce, alimony, and the custody of their daughter. "," It is difficult to tell how much of Mrs. Smith's initiative to file the petition was due to the concept of interracial adultery or just due to the simple unfaithfulness of her husband. No doubt race played some sort of role, since southern plantation society was built on a social hierarchy of fuel by racial relations. However, it seems that indicating the race of the third party would not have much affected Mrs. Smith's case. The accusation was more about the act itself rather than the individuals involved. "," According to Rothman, women's chances for successfully procuring divorces were not greatly enhanced by an emphasis on the interracial sexual activities of their spouses.

Making his way through a swampy pine barren, Ruffin found little trace of any cultivation or civilized inhabitation. The few people in the area raised cattle and, since their animals grazed on the open land, the concept of property ownership was completely foreign to these miserable people. Ruffin scorned the crude capitalists, for some of them owned 500 to 1,000 head of cattle and not a single acre of land. In his private diary, Ruffin noted that these men belonged to a peculiar class: In about a space of 10 miles square of Williamsburg and Georgetown districts, the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, have no slaves, scarcely any other property, and almost no agricultural labor or regular industry of any kind. The men live by hunting, often helped out by petty pillage or trespass on the neighboring properties. These people, and even the more industrious and honest of the poor in lower S. Ca. are a most wretched and worthless population - compared to those whose condition that of the slaves is one not only of greatly superior comfort and happiness, but also of respectability and dignity.","Edmund Ruffin had been commissioned by James Hammond, then governor of South Carolina, to perform an agricultural and geological survey of the state. Ruffin had developed new methods of using calcerous manures to improve the fertility of soil, and some South Carolinians hoped that agricultural reform would help develop the economy and preserve the institution of slavery. Ruffin was always a renowned advocate for secession and an ardent believer in the inferiority of the black race.","Ruffin's disdain for the poor whites of South Carolina's coastal plain demonstrates the power of class in antebellum society. Notions of class were always intertwined with the institution of slavery. In his account, Ruffin immediately emphasized that these people owned no slaves, consigning themselves to a pitiful class. But as Stephanie McCurry demonstrates in <em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>, the intricate relationships of power within the yeoman household were just as significant as those more conspicuous class tensions between plantation owners and yeoman farmers. Poor white men set boundaries of power within their household that defined the roles of their wives and their laborers. The yeomen and the powerful planters of the low country were not socioeconomic equals, but they shared a position of power over their respective households, a power rooted in gendered symbols of inequality, command over dependents, and a fundamental assertion of manly independence."],"display_date":"March 31, 1843","search_date":"1843-03-31","locations":[{"id":11523,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3298,"title":"The Peculiarity of William Knoth&#39;s Insanity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-09-14","end_date":"1853-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Knoth, an inmate of the Insane Asylum located in Augusta County, Virginia, escaped the facility and fled to Canada.

This is assumed to be the reason why he left for Canada. In addition, the inmate took with him 300, which he wasted away. ","After receiving the unfortunate news, Knoth's family became very disturbed at the peculiar direction their loved one's insanity led him. They spread word of his escape and their desire to have him brought back to them. Is Knoth's behavior really that peculiar? Historian Edward L. Ayers would probably disagree with this characterization of Knoth's behavior. In his work, <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</em>, Ayers places slavery at the heart of Augusta County's economy. He notes that in the 1850's over sixteen hundred white households owned fifty-five hundred slaves within the county. With this newly gained knowledge Knoth's actions; that previously seemed rash and contingent with his insanity; now appear rational. Ayers further ascertains that slavery stood as a fundamental fact in Augusta County. In fact, its roots dug even deeper into the heart of the county when slave prices inflated dramatically in the 1850s. This inflation reassured Southerners that slaves were a good investment, and further intensified their desire to protect the institution that accounted for their prosperity from the growing threats that were prevalent in the years leading up to the Civil War.

Mary Kendall, a Northerner living with her new husband in the South, wrote to her sister to describe the feelings of loneliness. While slave-owning men were businessmen and often traveled for trade, their wives were left to run the plantations. Kendall wrote that she had recently gone three weeks without seeing another white woman. This was not the case for all Southern women. According to a census from 1810-1860 in Virginia and the Carolinas, 35% of families were made up of two parents and children, whereas 41% of families consisted of extended family as well. After marriage, Mary Jane Holladay Thompson lived with her husband, her daughter, and her uncle-in-law, whom she found insufferable. Even so, she tolerated him for her husband's sake.","White women lived in close proximity to slave women, but lives of the two were very different.

They replaced the traditions of their ancestors with many economic, social and political practices of this invasive, foreign culture. "," In 1830, the Choctaws ceded the claims to their native Mississippi land in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Most of the Choctaws were forced to leave their home soil, but approximately two thousand, many of whom were mixed-bloods, were allowed to stay and adopt white culture as a life-style. The Choctaw occupied an anomalous position in the social structure of the antebellum South. They were not slaves, not landowners, not white, and not black. They did not fit into any of the accepted social and cultural classes of the time. Most became tenant farmers or sharecroppers.

They are cultivators of the soil....The chase is abandoned and they are gradually advancing in civilization, and in those pursuits which, under the wise management of our Government, is elevating them in a social point of view, reads the article. The author of this editorial, and many other Americans of the period, saw the dramatic societal changes among the Choctaw to be an astonishing improvement from their former indigenous state. The more white culture the tribes adopted the better. Yet, at the same time, Anglo culture was robbing the Choctaw and other Indian nations of their unique heritage and way of life.

According to Raymond and Alice Bauer, masters saw their slaves' smiling, bowing, and scraping as evidence of their happiness, docility, and acceptance as part of an inferior race. On the other hand, slaves frustrated their masters with feigned illness and pregnancy, broken tools, and running away for short stints to avoid work. This laziness was punished through whippings and other humiliating practices. Slaves resisted day to day in these subtle ways, confusing and provoking their masters. ","Physical slave violence and insurrection were much rarer than these more passive forms of resistance. Attacks like the one against Mrs. Smith did not occur frequently.

Slaves, being the property of their masters, couldn't just freely marry at their heart's desire. There was a standard protocol. In his biographical narrative, Allen Parker recounted how the process would likely unfold on a plantation in Chowan County, North Carolina. If a male slave wanted to marry a woman from another plantation, he first had to obtain the permission of the girl herself. Then, he would ask for consent from his own masters. If they approved, he would then travel to the girl's plantation and approach her owner. The conversation would go something like: Hello Sam Is that you? <em>Yes Massa, its me... </em>Sam, what message did your Master send by you? <em>Did'nt send no message, sar, I comed myself.</em> What You don't mean to say that you have run away Sam? <em>No sar, Massa told me as how I might come and see Massa Jones. </em>Well Sam, what is it, does your Master intend to hire you out next year and you want me to hire you? <em>No sar, Massa John don't let his niggers, he wants me hisself.

Then, he would prolong the matter: Well Sam, I like your looks, and I will think it over. You come and see me next week and I will tell you. <em>Can I see Sue, Massa? </em>Yes Sam, you can see her when she comes from the field. After spending some time with his sweetheart and waiting a week, the slave would then return to the owner: Hello Sam, you here again, what do you want this time? <em>Well Massa Jones, I comed to see as to what you thought about me and Sue getting married. </em>Get out you nigger. <em>But Massa told Sam to come. </em>How's that Sam? <em>Massa Jones told Sam to come in one week, and den Massa Jones tell Sam as how he can marry Sue or not. </em>O yes, I remember now, well Sam I have talked it over with Sue's Mistress and we have concluded to let you marry Sue, and I will have a cabin built down by the quarters and Sue can live there. <em>Thankie Massa.","</em>","African Americans strove to establish meaningful family relations under slavery. There was a strong desire for social space between slave and master, as Emily West notes in <em>Chains of Love</em>. Though slave marriages were not legally recognized under traditional white law, developing meaningful relationships that existed independent of white authority represented a means of resistance against oppression. These relationships also pointed out the gender differences among slaves, the male being expected to initiate romantic contact. Allen Parker recalled how his father would regularly walk ten miles in the middle of the night to see his wife and his family. Slave families often had to struggle to remain together as evidenced in Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Enslaved persons would often manipulate the paternalist sympathies of their owners, reminding them that filial bonds of slaves were just as powerful as those for whites."],"display_date":1852,"search_date":"1852-07-01","locations":[{"id":9345,"lat":36.285880348,"lng":-76.6866587179,"zoom":10,"place":"CHOWAN, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3331,"title":"African American Religious Services\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-09-18","end_date":"1868-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In one edition of the <em>Page Valley Courier Newspaper</em> a reader asserts that The African Baptist Church is larger than any other Baptist church other than on in England.

Mary Wightman Helm had good reason to rejoice after a most difficult journey to Texas. Helm related that the trip usually took a bearable seven days, but left without a breeze in the unpredictable Gulf of Mexico, her voyage took an astonishing 31 days. The ship only carried provisions for the expected seven days and was insufficiently stocked with water. It is no surprise that under these conditions Helm fell ill. She related, after our cooked provisions had given out, crackers and hard sea bread sustained life; but when the water gave out, then real suffering commenced. ","Helm had already survived extensive travels before she boarded the Little Zoe, the schooner that took her and her husband Elias R. Wightman to Texas. The couple departed Herkimer County, New York in 1828 and set out upon a popular route to the West. They traveled by boat down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the boarded a steamboat bound for New Orleans by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. At New Orleans, the Helms embarked upon their troubled cruise on the Little Zoe. At the time, such schooners were the primary means of travel between New Orleans and Texas because their shallow bottoms were less likely to hit the sandbars that existed along the coast of Texas. The small ships, however, were subject to the fickle weather of the Gulf of Mexico. ","Though the Helms found their voyage particularly unpleasant, it pales in comparison to the horrific passage of slaves brought from Africa to the American South. The South's economy created a great demand for slaves that fueled the trans-Atlantic slave trade even after it became illegal in America in 1808. Like Mary Helm, enslaved Africans faced hunger and sickness but also bore the added burden of generally inhumane conditions on the journey to America. Sources describe the system of transportation as gruesome and ruthlessly efficient. Such factors as malnutrition... and deprivation of sunlight from prolonged stays below deck made illness and high death rates unavoidable. And though the trade was outlawed by the United States in 1808, the illegal trade that continued through portals such as Texas brought about unprecedented horrors for captured Africans. Though most of the slaves in Texas were brought from the United States an illegal [trans-Atlantic] slave trade developed as early as 1835. The injustices that took place on slave ships occurred on the seas rather than American soil, but the blood shed on such vessels belonged on the plantations of the South. The demand for slaves created by Texas and the other Southern states led directly to the brutalities against Africans.

Carter Williams, a Norfolk resident, visible at the front of the Confederate line at Chancellorsville, led a most daring charge, the battle's first day, into the teeth of federal infantry and their cannons. The 6 Virginia captured the Union color bearer and seized the guns, resulting in Robert E. Lee, himself, personally thanking the brave Capt Williams the next morning. Soon after receiving such a high honor, Carter fell in battle, becoming one of many left strewn across the field that bloody day. "," On June 18, 1884, Capt. James Barron Hope asked those assembled from Pickett-Buchanan Camp of ex-Confederates and from the city of Norfolk to remember the sacrifices of fellow soldiers. He spoke of warriors like Capt. Williams, who never returned and whose resting spots constituted Virginia's most precious jewels. All those assembled witnessed the dedication of a Confederate memorial to honor the memory of fallen veterans and the Cause, though lost a cause which our brothers believed was right and which we believe is right today. After a solemn procession and readings of poems heavily laced with heroic imagery, the audience gathered as Confederates and declared each 18 of June a memorial day to those they would never forget. "," Southern romanticism with the Lost Cause and the Confederacy grew along with the increasing manifestation of a New South towards the end of the nineteenth century. The South suffered from a prevailing sense of inferiority and a constant need for justifying such a position, and the years of Southern reconciliation witnessed the peak in this cult of the Confederacy. The older generation recoiled as the younger generation embraced Yankee values and forgot or misunderstood what the veterans had fought for. Thus, the former Confederates felt compelled to make their offspring remember a society they saw evaporating before their eyes. By 1896, 75 percent of former Confederate counties had United Confederate Veterans groups, representing a third of the ex-southern soldiers still living. For similar reasons, women formed the Daughters of the Confederacy, which sought to raise money for building monuments, like the one in Norfolk, to make this past permanent. One of the biggest celebrations occurred in Richmond, where in 1890 100,000 people gathered to raise the Robert E. Lee monument. "," Ironically, some advocates pushing towards a New South, sought out Confederate imagery to help legitimize their projects. Railroads, oftentimes, would locate an impoverished, old Confederate general, and put his name on their letter-head as effective advertising. Even a new style of American literature played a key role in reassembling the values and virtues of the fabled Southern aristocracy. Fiction became distinctively Confederate in sympathy in a way that had not even existed in the ante-bellum South's defense of its peculiar practices. Northern authors even carried this theme. Likewise, one saw an increase in genealogy, as people tried to connect themselves to these lost heroes of the past. Eventually, those groups using Lost Cause imagery to profit no longer needed it, while those who truly embodied it gradually died off. Though perhaps diminishing in numbers, this undercurrent of Confederate nostalgia (especially seen in race relations) would remain into the twentieth century.

The men divided themselves into committees on issues ranging from education to temperance. On the final evening each committee presented their resolutions on the individual concerns addressed at the convention. The most extensive and detailed solutions addressed the criminal justice and education systems. They advocated a change in the jury system that would allow the participation of black men. They also sought regulations for chain gangs and prison life and the adoption of an anti-lynching law. In education, the men desired a six-month school year, and more private and public funding for schools, especially from the state. The men researched other important issues and reported, although following the convention, no significant public changes were made. Following the Civil War and the ending of slavery, whites needed a new way to cope with free blacks in the society. They solved this problem by adopting Jim Crow laws and segregation policies. While almost all aspects of public life became segregated in the South, education and the criminal justice system were two of the most intensely separated between the races. Schools differed among blacks and whites on the school year, funding, and facilities. White children attended school for six months, three months longer than black children. The white schools also received the majority of the state's education budget for new schools, textbooks, and materials. The remaining money in the budget was given to black schools, which was barely sufficient to keep schools running. The criminal justice system was just as poorly run. Georgia employed a chain gang and the prisons housed predominantly black convicts. The criminals were held at the mercy of white guards and officials who had no hesitation in allowing the prevalence of assault, hunger, sex, inadequate clothing, and even disease. It was not uncommon for guards to hire out black prisoners for labor-an arrangement that resembled slavery. While the Georgia men at the convention tried to make these blatant discriminations disappear, very little came of it. When the Supreme Court declared separate but equal legal in the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, segregation would remain implemented into the next century."],"display_date":"January 25, 1888 - January 26, 1888","search_date":"1888-01-25","locations":[{"id":1552,"lat":32.8067094598,"lng":-83.6980226314,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3355,"title":"Civil Rights Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-01-06","end_date":"1874-01-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In January of 1874, the United States Congress introduced a bill concerning civil rights in the South.

Cotton was seen as an agricultural gold mine and resulted in a great hunt to search for and obtain this valuable land. ","This widespread desire for cotton created an economical boom in Mississippi which led to an increased number of settlers. After the War of 1812, a substantial number of Native Americans were removed from the area which offered fresh land at a cheep price to anyone who was interested in farming agricultural products. The geographical location of this state consequently turned Mississippi into one of the leading cotton producing areas in the nation due to the fertile soils and excellent climate needed for farming this crop. Because the soil was so deep and rich, farmers could plant cotton season after season without having to rotate fields or worry about exhausting the supply of nutrients in the dirt. This newly liberated land not only became the home for rich plantation owners who cultivated cotton on large plots of land. Poorer farmers were able to purchase property and raise row crops and tend to livestock as well as middle class folk who had dreams of someday entering the plantation society by working their way up to larger plots of land as they became more successful. ","Raising and picking cotton demand a great deal of hand labor, and the crop, typically, was worked by slave gang labor on large plantations. This overbearing stipulation resulted in a search by plantation owners to find more help on farms. Slaves were heavily sought after and cotton became one of the most influential contributors to the slave trade because of the number of people it took to harvest. By 1820 in cotton producing areas of Tennessee the number of African Americans populating this region had increased exponentially consisting of 80,107 blacks which formed 18.9 percent of the total residents.

Looking at Virginia's entire 2 district (heavily African American), which included these Tidewater counties, Democrats appeared to have netted about 4,000 votes, greatly slimming the opposition's lead. Sensing the reaction of Mahone's Readjuster Party, which commanded the Virginian Republican vote, the Democrats planned appropriately. Contacting a renowned gunsmith in Portsmouth, they ordered fifty new Winchester rifles, to be strategically dispersed near important voting precincts. Along with the men unafraid to use these guns, this stern measure of intimidation hoped to discourage white Mahonite leaders from inciting the newly disenfranchised black voters to attack the polling places. Celebrating such an important political gain, Southampton Democrats held a large rally at Newsome's farm attended by great numbers of local farmers. "," Virginia's Reconstruction Constitution in 1869 gave blacks and previously disenfranchised poor whites the right to vote, thus largely expanding the electorate in what had been the South's largest slave holding state. Virginia politics during Reconstruction differed from that of most other former-Confederate states, as no real Republican party emerged. Rather, the Readjuster party took up many Republican platforms, and quickly became the party of the African American vote. The Readjusters combined the black vote with that of the poor whites, and it appeared as if a coalition, capable of challenging the white ruling elite, had finally arisen. Sensing disaster, the Democrats began to couch their political appeals in the late 1880's in strictly racial terms, hoping to appeal to a sense of white solidarity. As they defended themselves from the Readjuster onslaught, Democrats also sought to disenfranchise blacks, thereby stifling a future biracial coalition. "," Unfortunately for the Democrats, the Fifteenth Amendment made it very difficult to restrict the right to vote for race-based reasons at face value. Thus, in this period of Redemption, election officials (most often Democrats themselves) would employ registration and election restrictions that they knew targeted blacks and, subsequently, some poor whites. Oftentimes, they would also commit outright voter fraud by stealing ballots, stuffing ballot boxes, or erasing names from the registration. Virginia also adopted the Australian ballot, aimed at confusing those who could not read, by not listing party names next to candidates, and giving voters less than two minutes in the voting booth. Nonetheless, black leaders, especially in the Tidewater area, continued to resist such coercive measures by flooding the polls with blacks, even if their votes were not being counted. "," Motivated, predominately, by the desire to more effectively hinder the black vote, Virginia, and other Southern states, underwent constitutional conventions in the 1890's. Resulting in residency requirements, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, the South crippled the non-Democratic vote, evidenced by the drastic decline in voter turnout. Whereas 75 percent of eligible voters voted in 1890, this figure dived to 33 percent by 1900. Outright intimidation, though rare, also would emerge in the form of the Klu Klux Klan and the Red Shirts, vigilante groups who ensured few blacks would slip through the cracks. In Virginia's eastern counties, resistance to such Democratic injustice could also spell doom at the hands of newly purchased Winchester rifles.

This was reported in the <em>City Gazette</em> and <em>Commercial Daily Advertiser </em>for months. He had been a paper boy (carrier of the <em>City Gazette</em>) and was able to read and write. He was formerly enslaved in Virginia (his mother was still there) and worked for the Petersburg Intelligencer. He was known for his skill at the printing press. ","The owner believed that Tom had left Charleston by ship and perhaps had forged his own free papers. The owner thought he may have been pretending to need passage to a Camp Meeting. Camp Meetings were the religious craze of the era and were connected most with the Methodist Church. There was a camp meeting being held at a local creek, and it would have considered un-Christian to refuse passage of a black man to a religious service. Many whites justified slavery as a way to spread Christianity to people who would otherwise live without it. ","There were rewards for the return of Tom to the owner (B.S. Thomas) that increased depending on the effort involved in Tom's return. His description is given as 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a bright yellow complexion. Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free.

","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822.

In it, a gentleman from Natchitoches, Louisiana reported that the Chief of the Caddo Indian Confederacy was plotting a conspiracy with the Spanish officials in Texas. Despite having traveled into the province on mercantile business, the Chief returned spouting adoration for King Ferdinand VII and boasting of his new title: Generalisimo of all the Indian tribes resident beyond the celebrated Arrayo Honde, between [Natchitoches] and the Sabine. All travelers in this area were subject to arrest by this new minister of the Spanish monarch. The citizens of Natchitoches feared the consequences. Their town was located only a short six miles from Arrayo Honde. The author of the letter feared increased violence and Indian attacks against townspeople and adventurous Americans, as well as the encumbrance of Spanish authority in what he believed to be American lands.","Until 1819, the Spanish still laid claims to the lands of Louisiana just east of the Sabine River up to the Arrayo Honde, a tributary of the Red River, while Americans held that the Sabine maintained the border between Spanish Texas and American Louisiana. During Thomas Jefferson's presidency, the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon, who approved the sale to promote war against Britain. The territory of Louisiana had only just changed from Spanish to French hands through the treaty of San Ildefonso three years earlier. Neither the French nor the Americans attempted to define the borders of the territory until the treaty was signed in 1803, at which point, the French foreign minister replied, I can give you no direction. You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it. ","For the next two decades, the Spanish in Texas and the Americans migrating into Louisiana wrestled over land. The treaty did not define the western border of the Louisiana Territory, so the Spanish sought means to push their claim and authority further east, through individuals like the Caddo Chief, while American settlers pushed back with equal force. The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 solved these struggles. It gave up American claims to Texas and Spanish claims east of the Sabine. Despite opposition from westerners who steamed over the loss of Texas, support for the treaty was unanimous in Congress.","This episode demonstrated a significant disjunction between the federal government's concerns and the desires of the American people actually living on the frontier in Louisiana. The author stated somewhat sardonically, How far this affair may require the interpolation of government, government will best determine; but be assured we consider it a matter of considerable importance. The author's tone and comments dripped with disdain for a government that seemed unconnected with his needs. The sense that the people actually living in these borderlands might need to defend their own rights because their government was unable or unwilling to do so permeated throughout the letter. This suggests that the people living in the West were unimpressed with a government that could not keep up with their demands for more land or negotiate effectively to solidify ownership of territory which people living on the frontier believed should belong to them."],"display_date":"February 10, 1817","search_date":"1817-02-10","locations":[{"id":5585,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NATCHITOCHES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3388,"title":"Fatal Shooting in Jackson \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-09-07","end_date":"1895-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of September 7, 1895 in the Saloon of Cain and Davis, an altercation occurred between two African American men, in which Mr. William Miller shot Mr. Dick Wilcox in the bowels. Miller had allegedly threatened Wilcox, just a day before, that if he refused to repay a debt of fifty cents he would be killed. On the morning of the shooting, Wilcox entered the saloon in which Miller was seated. When he received no compensation upon demand of the money, he fatally shot Miller. Wilcox immediately escaped to the Fork Deer bottom, where he was pursued by the Sheriff and his men.","In the South, this kind of violence was an ordinary occurrence as many people opted to take justice into their own hands rather than leave it to the authorities. Historian C. Vann Woodward says The South seems to have been one of the most violent communities of comparable size in all Christendom. This kind of violence in the post- Civil War American South was extremely prevalent, as homicides alone sometimes doubled and tripled the number of such deaths prior to the War. Old census reports exist, however prove unreliable because the reports usually fell far short of the number of actual homicides. ","Freedmen such as Miller appeared in newspapers often for violent offenses as did others, but usually situations involving them were labeled colored. This significance allowed the majority of the newspapers' intended readers, white society, to understand what African Americans were capable of. ","However distinct the reports of incidents such as the shooting between Miller and Wilcox became towards black men, violence of the South in general could not have been attributed to only African Americans because in several southern states white men were killed much more often in proportion to their own population. Southern newspapers of the day were often crowded with homicides between professionals such as lawyers, planters, railroad presidents, doctors, preachers, and editors. The cause for many of these homicides were usually trivial, but were influenced by the phenomena of how carrying a pistol became normal for many Southerners.

However, she was scheduled to leave for Europe to meet with her husband, and the plantation would have to continue its day-to-day activities without her supervision. Leigh wrote in her diary that she worried about leaving the place entirely in charge of the negro captains, even though her slaves were recognized within her community as well behaved. However, to her surprise, the workers approached her and begged that [she] would leave some one over them in [her] place when [she] left. They pleaded, Missus, we must have a white men to back us when you are gone; de people not mind what we say. To her great relief, Leigh was able to employ a white overseer to manage the black laborers in her absence. He was a man recommended to her by trusted neighbors. Later in her diary she wrote that neighbors spoke of how well kept her plantation was and how orderly the black workers were compared to others. ","Not only was Leigh nervous about leaving the plantation without a white overseer, but the black workers themselves were as well. They insisted on having a white manager to increase the legitimacy of their place above the other black laborers. Perhaps having a white overseer acknowledge the black captains' positions within the hierarchy on the plantation increased the respect they were shown by their fellow hired-hands. Later in her diary, Leigh wrote that there existed two vital characteristics that a successful overseer must possess: he must be southern, and a gentleman. She surmised that only Southerners were capable of understanding blacks and their peculiarities. Northerners, no matter how hard they tried, would never be able to understand their characters. Northerners had not lived their entire lives alongside the blacks; they had not experienced the trials and tribulations of every day life that influence people's development. Southerners had grown up with blacks who they considered a part of the family. Additionally, class was extremely important. Leigh observed that it was useless to put a person holding an inferior social position over them, because the laborers were highly conscientious of class dynamics. Having been at the bottom of the social hierarchy for so long, African Americans recognized that emancipation had opened up the opportunity for social advancement. Through hard work they could gradually move up in society. In the fields, though, they were less likely to work hard if their overseer was not of a higher class. They did not consider him worthy of their deference or respect. It was not enough that the overseer be white; he must be of a distinguished character. The dynamics of the relationship between the hired black laborers and their white employer represent a post-war South that seemed to replicate antebellum social practices. And yet, the importance of class hints at a growing indication that blacks were aware of their status as freedmen. They understood that their place in the social hierarchy was no longer permanently stagnant.

The newspapers prior to the Civil War are full of reminders that not all people were in fact equal. Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD. My man GILES, who calls himself GILES BURLEY, left my plantation in Louisa County, Virginia, on the 3rd day of January. He has gone over the mountains, in company with some of the many hirelings. He described Burley's appearance in great detail, down to the amount of money that he was probably carrying.","At the time, slave trade was a legitimate profession. The traders were not considered to be the nicest of men, but it was a business, and they were in it to make money. Local traders would start small, and gradually build their enterprises. Sales were commonly made from farm to farm within a region. An ad directly above the aforementioned runaway notice declared a sale of slaves because of the owner's death. The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9. It is presumed that this family would be split among different farms in the region; a reality that was a constant incentive for slaves to behave. ","With the Compromise of 1850 came a tightening of the Fugitive Slave Act. Anyone who helped a slave escape would be punished. Northern abolitionists found this to be preposterous; in fact, both the North and the South hated the compromise.

Plantation owners endured an unfamiliar transition period during the time. Because they were so dependent upon a disciplined, trained labor force, most whites tried to hire their ex-slaves.

Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

One early morning, a terrorist mob group named the White Caps, kidnapped Cal Fowler, a black man, and severely buggy whipped his back. The White Caps called Fowler a 'worthless shiftless negro,' and accused him of 'doing a great deal of talking in regard to the lynching of Dock King.' Fowler reportedly had planned to notify U.S. detectives to work the lynching case, hence his beating. ","The White Caps were a vigilante group who operated in Eastern Tennessee in the late nineteenth century. Masked in white, members of this secret organization attempted to drive away or reform obnoxious persons by lynch- law methods. Mob attacks were performed frequently by white people toward blacks as a means to demoralize them and restore the social order among blacks and whites from the Antebellum Period. ","Fowler's experience was not rare. Mob violence first became popular in the South during the Antebellum Period as a form of systematic terrorism against whites as opposed to blacks, who were valuable as chattel. However according to historian W. Fitzhugh Brundage, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction fueled violence against blacks as whites refused to accept emancipated slaves' quest for economic and political power. Lynching became a favored practice of these mobs, as it mirrored the 'Tyburn gallows,' which were notorious in ancient London as the site of public executions by hanging. These executions became public spectacles and the executed bodies would remain hung as a symbol of justice and warning to those willing to disobey social norm. The number of lynchings in the South began to rise in the 1880s, climaxing in 1892 where mobs executed an estimated seventy one whites, as well as one hundred and fifty five blacks, the largest number of lynchings in history of both the South and the United States of America.

The Maddens long tenure in the area allowed them to become involved in various aspects of the community. The family relied heavily on their farm, known as Madden Farm, for sustenance. However, during the 1890s, both Thomas Madden and his wife Landonia Stokes supplemented their meager income by teaching in schools in Culpeper. Despite the extra work, the family's combined income was only 280 dollars a year, barely enough to feed their family. The social structure of the times made it difficult for African Americans to feel secure in any public job, and 1901 demonstrated that the concerns of families like the Maddens was justified because the Maddenville school fired Landonia. Even though it was clear that the family had been scraping by and that the loss of Landonia's income would be a hardship, the school's trustees decided that two teacher's salaries were too much for one black family. Despite the Madden's long-standing ties to the community, no one stood up for them, not even their own neighbors. ","Extreme poverty was a large part of the black world following the Civil War. In the book American South, William Cooper Jr. and Thomas Terril explain that the occupational structure of the South did not leave much opportunity for blacks to improve their training or employment circumstances. The majority of blacks continued to earn their living by farming, but they were much less likely than whites to own the land that they farmed, and they worked as sharecroppers or tenants. In addition, the number of professional blacks was incredibly small. Finally, black women, like Landonia Madden, worked outside of the home with much greater frequency than did white women. ","Even though blacks continued to face severe racial and economic obstacles, their lives were much better after the Civil War. For them, the period between 1865 and 1900 saw increased birth rates, decreased mortality rates, an increase in literacy, and also an increase in income. Because they were no longer slaves, blacks had greater control over their labor and a greater ability to negotiate wages. Their successes, however, only increased the resolve of whites to limit blacks' advancement.

The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution.

Regardless, stories of the North and specifically, a place referred to as Philadelphia, were incentive enough to prompt some to brave the terrifying unknown and escape the even more terrifying world in which they were already bound. At some point during the day - or perhaps it was the night - of April 9, 1847 a certain enslaved girl called Harriet disappeared from her owner's home in New Orleans. Details are not disclosed: was Harriet a slave on a large plantation or smaller home within the city? Had she just arrived? Did she have any children - or was she even old enough to bear a child? For all the mystery surrounding her departure from New Orleans, the fact remains that at least her owner was convinced that she had run away. "," A few days later, a small ad appeared in the <em>Times-Picayune</em> offering a 20 reward for this runaway. The description was still minimal, the ad offering only a few characteristics: She has a mark on her forehead, and a pleasing smile when spoken to. Information about her age or coloring was noticeably lacking, but the few brief sentences that were there did offer some insight into this woman's life. According to the owner, Harriet spoke not only English, but also French and Spanish. Her Spanish skills are rather mysterious, as there was virtually no Spanish influence in Louisiana at that point in Antebellum New Orleans. This may have been unintentional, but the fact also remains that Harriet's first listed language was French. The ad also included a stern admonition towards ship captains: they were overtly warned against harboring her."," These details hint at a life that may have been a bit out of the ordinary. The description about Harriet's disappearance, and the information that her owner chose to disclose, suggests that she may not have taken the typical escape route northward, but instead had access to escape via some waterway. The illegal nature of that was easily dismissed in light of Harriet's own defiance of the law. The slave trade was very much alive and well in the world of 1847 Louisiana, but the importation of slaves from Africa to the United States had been put to an end in 1807, after Thomas Jefferson signed a bill with that explicit purpose. Of course, this government action merely meant to some that their business operations would from then on be considered illegal. At that point, slavery had already become an integral part of the American economy, and taking legal action against the institution did not mean that it would quickly or easily fade away into oblivion. Furthermore, in that same year of 1807, plantation owners approved of legislation in their new territory of Louisiana that effectively prevented any slave from potentially becoming emancipated. Although Jefferson no longer allowed Africans to be forcefully immigrated into the United States, the current slaves already living in America at the time received no breaks."],"display_date":"April 14, 1847","search_date":"1847-04-14","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3464,"title":"The Development of a Judicial System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Keep little or no money about you or in your trunk, John Bisland advised his son in a letter between the two, since you left this place our negro peer got a key and opened my trunk, he had robbed me of about 900 dollars. Issues between slaves and their masters especially problems with theft became a growing dilemma in the nineteenth century and a consisted of about half of the trials in the Adams County Circuit Court. Not only was the court house a place of law it was also the center of southern communities and a common place where citizens gambled, drank, brawled, listened to oratorical fights of rhetoric, and debated politics.","As the development of courts became a greater priority in American society so did issues concerning the decisions and decision makers in court. There were many debates regarding the process of convicting felons and whether the jury should make the final decision in cases or if judge should have the ultimate say. An article in a local Tennessee paper stated that because the trial by jury is guaranteed by the constitution, the judgments of the jurors must remain untrammeled to their minds but also to the actual law. ","The fact that the law was such a dominant part of nineteenth century life, creating sufficient jails was necessary in order to house convicted felons. In Adams county escapes from poorly constructed jails were so frequent, the sheriff was forced to adopt methods seen as inhuman in order to maintain security. New jails were needed and the architects who designed these structures put great time and thought into creating the safest, most secure facilities possible. Jail plans in Wilkinson County proposed the building to be 40 feet by 24 feet... with the external wall to be built of well burnt brick, two feet thick. Problems with the rapidly growing population played a large role in the design of these facilities especially after multiple embarrassing incidents regarding overcrowded jails had been reported. Because of these issues, in 1822, circuit judges were required to conduct or oversee examinations of jails at least once a year to make sure there were not any outstanding concerns that needed to be fixed.","Along with the costs necessary to construct and maintain court houses and jail facilities it was very expensive to imprison people who had broken the law. One governor of Mississippi demanded immediate trials and banned undetermined times of imprisonment due to the amount of money it cost to hold these prisoners in jail. Other measures were taken towards a similar direction and in 1822 a Mississippi governor allowed all prisoners except the ones who were being held for felonies to walk out of the jail as long the jury believed that they would abide by the decisions made in county court. Breaking the law was a sizeable problem in the nineteenth century and the state of Mississippi worked hard to provide the most appropriate punishment to convicted felons."],"display_date":"1817 - 1822","search_date":"1820-01-01","locations":[{"id":6935,"lat":31.1786199617,"lng":-90.7973265096,"zoom":9,"place":"AMITE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3471,"title":"Mr. Brown and the Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-13","end_date":"1831-01-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mr. Brown's absence was a strain on the family that he left behind. Taking care of day-to-day business without a husband and father in the rough settlement of San Felipe de Austin was not an easy feat. The pressures upon the family increased as time went by, and the news of him they received after his absence spanned one month was not heartening. Brown was taking part in an exploration of the upper colonies of Texas, and his party's horses were stolen in an Indian raid. However, the settlers vowed to pursue the marauders and not to return until their stolen property was recovered. Additionally disturbing was the fact that Indians had recently committed several such attacks in the upper colonies. ","The fact that even in the sparsely populated lands of Mexico's northern colonies Brown and other Anglo-Americans were involved in conflicts with Indians was indicative of the Indians' struggles within the United States. Interestingly, the Indians of the upper colonies were not all native to the area. In fact, as a result of persecution within the United States, many of the Indians with whom the Anglo-American settlers interacted were displaced members of the Cherokee tribe. After the American Revolution, a large number of Cherokee left their traditional homes in the southeastern part of the United States, and moved west to Louisiana, then owned by the far more welcoming Spanish. As time passed, more and more Cherokee who found their eastern homes encroached upon by white settlers joined their tribal brethren to the west. Following the U.S. purchase of Louisiana, many Cherokee again moved, now seeking to live under the friendlier Spanish government in Texas. As time passed, Anglo-American settlers as well as the Spanish government again threatened the Cherokee Indians. Cherokee leaders actually applied for a formal land grant in order to legally secure their lands from other settlers, but they correctly interpreted repeated delays in their application's approval as a portent of eventual rejection. By 1826, the Cherokee were desperate enough to take part in an armed insurrection against the Mexican government, along with some Anglo-American settlers and other indigenous groups. The revolt was crushed by Mexican troops with the aid of volunteers from the more established American colonies. ","The plight of the Cherokee in Texas was merely a later chapter in their great struggle resulting from the colonization of their native lands. Throughout the history of the South, Indians occupied large portions of the region's soil and directly influenced politics, agriculture, and other aspects of Southern life. It was not until approximately 30 years before the Civil War that the Indian populations of the South were forcibly removed from the area. However, with the continual westward movement of settlers, political and physical conflict between Anglo-Americans and Indians would continue to be a factor in shaping the country for years to come."],"display_date":"January 13, 1831","search_date":"1831-01-13","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3476,"title":"From Freedom to Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-01-01","end_date":"1841-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Born and raised a freeman, Solomon Northup met a group of men in his hometown of Saratoga Springs one March day in 1841. They claimed to have heard of his propensity at the violin and requested to hire him to accompany their traveling circus performances. The pay was quite reasonable and Northup eagerly took on the job. He accompanied them the entire way down to Washington, D.C. without realizing that this was a cruel trick. Those circus performers were, in fact, slave traders looking to make a quick profit off of selling free men. "," Northup did not realize the true motives of his companions until he awoke one morning bound in chains in a damp and dark cell-like room. He never saw the traders again, but the nightmare to which they introduced him continued. From Washington, Northup was put on a ship with other enslaved people and relocated to New Orleans."," After arriving in New Orleans, Northup's outraged cries of his free status went largely ignored or resulted in angry lashings. He was placed in a slave pen along with many others. First thing next morning everyone received a bath, if necessary, a shave, and a set of cheap but clean new clothes. Northup experienced firsthand the degradation that occurred inside those slave pens; when the customers arrived, the traders paraded the slaves around and allowed them to be patted down, walked about, questioned and otherwise examined. Some of these prospective buyers demanded that the slaves open their mouths and display their teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. The dehumanization continued with mandatory exercise activities taking place. At one point Northup was even called on to provide violin music to the slaves' tortured dancing."," These New Orleans slave pens mocked any notion of innate or universal humanism. The slave traders and future owners translated their own discomfort with the practice of trading people into viewing the so-called 'items' for sale with repulsion. In their eyes, blacks existed purely for the purpose of making them, the whites, a profit. Because of this rationale, traders generally had no desire to attempt to keep many family ties together. Northup witnessed an instance of this: a buyer was prepared to purchase Emily, the daughter of his new slave Eliza, at Eliza's insistence. Before he could make the transaction, however, the trader firmly stated that she was simply not for sale. He wanted to keep her for a few more years until she matured into a more valuable slave. Up until then, Northup had lived his entire life as a free man, but in the slave pens of New Orleans he was audience to the atrocities committed against his people on a daily basis."],"display_date":1841,"search_date":"1841-07-02","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3478,"title":"Settlers and Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-02","end_date":"1830-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The steamboat made it safely over the sand bar and arrived at the mouth of the Brazos River in Texas. Upon landing, William Hunter quickly composed a letter to his business associate James Perry to give tidings of his safe arrival. Hunter noted to Perry the presence of 30 Negroes on board and wrote of his plan to inquire of the owner, a settler from Alabama, about the means of their transport into the Mexican territory that was Texas. Hunter clearly expressed interest in importing slaves to Texas, and he was not an inconsequential businessman. Perry, the recipient of his letter, was the brother-in-law of Stephen Austin, the most important player in Anglo-American settlement of Texas, and Hunter conducted business with both of these men. ","Though Hunter's life is poorly documented, much is known about his traveling companion, Stephen Austin. Austin's father, Moses Austin, originally negotiated with the Spanish government to secure a land grant and to bring 300 Anglo-American settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated northern reaches of Spain's North American possessions. Upon Moses Austin's death in 1821 (the same year that Mexico gained independence), the grant passed to Stephen Austin. The specific attention given by Hunter (and presumably shared by Austin) to the importation of slaves into Texas is of great interest due to its place in a primarily business-related letter and the early date at which it occurs. It appears that like other parts of the American South, slavery in Texas was associated with business and profit, regardless of slaveholders' professions of paternalistic sentiment toward enslaved people. Also, the fact that slaves were brought into Texas at such an early stage in Anglo-American settlement is important as it affected later national politics. ","The Mexican government, in fact, frowned upon the form of slavery found in the United States. All slaves in Mexico were legally emancipated in 1829, however Austin's powerful friends managed to secure an exemption from this law for Texas. In composing the Civil and Criminal Regulations that governed his colony, the laws regarding slavery were the only ones imported directly from codes in the American South. Such Anglo-American support of slavery at the highest levels demonstrates both the pervasive nature of the institution and the reason that it eventually became such an issue of contention. In the years before Texas joined the United States, the annexation debate was influenced by Texas's possible status as a slaveholding state. Reminiscent of the conditions that necessitated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Northern residents and anti-slavery forces were concerned with the balance of power shared by slaveholding and non-slaveholding states. In 1844 Democrat James K. Polk ran on a platform of annexing Texas and re-occupying Oregon, a bid to please both North and South. Thus, Hunter's seemingly innocuous comment regarding slaves being brought into Texas was actually a portent of turbulence to come."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3483,"title":"Staunton Convention of 1816: The Tyranny of Eastern Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-08-19","end_date":"1816-08-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["RESOLVED that this meeting will now proceed to elect two fit persons to meet delegates from other counties in this commonwealth at Staunton on the 19th of August next, for the purpose of concerting... judicious means of reforming the representation of the state legislatures,  stated the resolution of an Augusta County, Virginia citizens meeting. For the county seat, Staunton, state politics became local in the August of 1816, when a statewide convention was held in the town to, according to the Columbian of New York, amend or propose amendments to the [state] constitution. The delegates came specifically to debate questions of representation in the state legislation. As more settlers crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle in the Shenandoah Valley, they agitated for more representation in the House of Delegates-still dominated by lowlanders from the Eastern tidewater region."," Representatives from twenty-four of the western counties and 12 of the eastern counties came to Staunton on August 19. By the end of the convention five days later, the convention had drafted a memorial to be presented to the General Assembly. Noting that despite having less than half of the total population, the 49 counties in the southern and eastern parts of the state had a majority in the legislature, the memorial exclaimed that in a republican government the will of the government should be the law of the land and yet in a state boasting of the pure republican institutions, this first and fundamental principle of republicanism does not exist. The memorial received support from a commission formed by the state government to hear the results of the convention, and a resolution was drafted to hold another convention to rewrite the Constitution. The resolution passed the House of Delegates but was defeated by a vote of twelve to nine in the Senate."," While it did not pass, historian A.E. Dick Howard in his article for the Virginia Law Review, 'For the Common Benefit': Constitutional History in Virginia as a Casebook for the Modern Constitution-maker sees the Augusta Convention of 1816 as a part of a larger sectional conflict between the eastern and western parts of the state. Waves of migration during the eighteenth century, into Shenandoah Valley counties like Augusta, and subsequent prosperity and population boom resulted in political tension between the two parts of the state. These stresses were further exacerbated by economic slumps in the east and a general unwillingness among Tidewater residents to relinquish the power they had held in state politics since the state's creation, as reflected in the appearance of only 12 eastern counties at the Convention. The matter would not be settled until a convention was held in 1828 to reform the constitution."],"display_date":"August 19, 1816 - August 24, 1816","search_date":"1816-08-21","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3494,"title":"Wanted: Experienced Cook, World Traveler, Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-06-15","end_date":"1815-08-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A black enslaved man named Henry ran away from the Staunton, Virginia plantation of John G.

To the Lewis family, Caroline was an 'investment', and her disability meant that they would receive a poor return. "," Lewis's estate guardians knew they had to pay the bills and they chose to pay off expenses with people. In 1834 and 1835, his family was able to cover their debts by hiring out or selling enslaved people to others. Black families had to suffer for the white family to maintain its comfortable way of life. To soothe their patriarchal consciences, Lewis's family made a point in his accounts to note how they kept mothers and children together when they sold them. Lewis's story was not atypical. Upon his death, guardians had probably taken control of his estate and hired out or sold enslaved people to keep his dependents in comfort. The rising popularity of hiring out enslaved people signaled an economic shift in the South. As some basic industry entered into southern communities, it became more profitable to rent out a portion of the enslaved population to work in the primitive factories that sprouted up in the mixed agricultural economy rather than keeping them on the farms. Slave labor was cheaper than free labor, so it appealed to factory owners as well. "," Some of Lewis's enslaved people might also have been eventually sold further South from Virginia. With land better suited to produce for the booming cotton market than the tobacco-oriented Upper South, the Deep South's demand for forced labor increased even as its northern neighbors' supply of unnecessary labor rose. Deep South demand meeting Upper South supply ensured a forced southern migration of enslaved people. Sophisticated slave trading firms in big southern cities like Norfolk or Richmond used urban slave markets to oblige the economy by sending down enslaved black people from further North to New Orleans and elsewhere. Slave dealers sold the vast majority of enslaved people in direct bargaining processes with potential buyers in the slave pens. Rapid sales in massive public auctions did not occur as frequently.

According to the Wellsburg Herald, the black population of Wellsburg had been meeting nightly at societies or parties at the residences of other free blacks. But on this particular night something went wrong, or as the local white-owned newspaper mused, [the party] appears...to have been diverted from its legitimate object - affording an opportunity for the younger classes to meet, court, and sport together. The -'green-eyed monster' jealousy was of course not idle. A young free black man by the name of Thomas Groves was in town briefly as an employee on the steamer Miami and attended the party. When he left the house in the company of a local black woman, he got into an altercation with a group of local black men over his relationship with the woman. In the ensuing quarrel a member of the group pulled out a pistol and killed Groves. Though the identity of the actual killer was not known at press time, six of the men had been arrested on charge of being concerned in the riot. A hearing was scheduled for that afternoon.","Western Virginia, soon to become the new state of West Virginia, did not secede from the Union, and thus became a haven for free black men and escaped slaves during and after the Civil War. The border between West Virginia and Virginia was an important escape route from the Confederate states to the Upper South. Many former slaves were drawn to the area by the promise of a large number of high-paying jobs created by the burgeoning mining and timber industries. But in some cases, the influx of newly-free blacks was scarcely tolerated by the whites of the northern Border States. In an area that had traditionally had few blacks because of the lack of demand for slaves, the immigration of African Americans heightened tensions between the two races. The high tensions sometimes led to violence. In this case, however, the violence was limited to the black race, and so was looked on more as a diversion rather than cause for alarm.","Many of these escaped slaves became useful members of the Union Army, and some even became soldiers after conscription of African-Americans was approved in 1863. However, white attitudes toward free blacks in the South would remain a problem well into the 20th century, and soon black-on-black crime would be relatively ignored by many local southern authorities. Though the men in this case were arrested and perhaps even given a trial, this attitude of disdain among the whites would only increase during Reconstruction, and eventually transform into the codified racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the displacement of large groups of slaves during the Civil War and the sudden complete emancipation of the 14th Amendment, blacks and whites would be forced to deal with each other on grounds unfamiliar to both races.

A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation. This rivalry was still a factor in many parts of the South, even in the 1850s, especially in the less settled regions. Many parts of western Virginia were still wilderness at this time, and so this story would hold particular relevance for those in the less settled parts of the state."],"display_date":"June 26, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-26","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3507,"title":"Augusta County, Nat Turner, and Abolition","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1831, the news of Nat Turner's rebellion provoked a seemingly unexpected response from women in Augusta County, Virginia: a call for abolition. While the women called their actions unexampled, and they felt all the timidity incident to our sex in entering the sphere of politics, they worried that the revolt was but a partial execution of a widely projected scheme of carnage. They could not hide the fears which agitate our bosoms, and the dangers which await us, as revealed by recent tragical deeds. Apparently the women believed that the slaves, once emancipated, would have little incentive to revolt. Further, the women were ready to take on the lost labor themselves.  Tell us not of the labors & hardships we shall endure when our bondservants shall be removed from us. They have no terrors for us, the petition continued."," The <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the county, would later publish additional information on what is perhaps the same push for local women for emancipation. The <em>Annals</em> relate how, in 1831 John McCue, one of the State Delegates from Augusta, presented a memorial to the State Legislature signed by 215 Augusta women praying for emancipation. While emancipation was not granted, the Women were not alone. The Annals report that there were numerous other petitions from Augusta County as well."," Although contrary to the conventional view that slavery in the South was immutable, the women's' petition probably did not fall on deaf ears in the Virginia Legislature. Historian Scot French notes that the State Legislative session of 1831 and 1832 following Nat Turner's Rebellion, became a debate over the future of slavery, the specter of black insurgency, and the possibility of solving this problem through abolition and removal of African Americans from the state. French quotes James McDowell, from Augusta's neighboring county, Rockbridge, as commenting on the large number of black victims killed in a frenzied white response to the revolt: Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his deluded and drunken handful of followers which produced or could produce such effects? Was it this that induced distant counties where the very name of Southampton was strange to arm and equip for struggle? No, sir, it was the suspicion eternally attached to the slave himself, the suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family. It was as if Nat Turner had in one vicious stroke exposed the violence at the very heart of the slave system, to the point that more than a few in Augusta County and Virginia wanted to abstain."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":13636,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3508,"title":"A Contraband Works for the Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-14","end_date":"1862-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The contraband only spent a short time working for James D. Templeton's brigade before his death, but in that time the ex-slave managed to leave a lasting impression. Templeton was a young Union soldier from Savannah, Ohio who took part in several major battles of the Civil War, including Antietam. He spent much of his first two years in the mountains of West Virginia, as the horn player in a military band attached to Rutherford B. Hayes' 23rd Ohio Infantry. On April 14, 1862, he wrote home to his parents to describe a former slave, or contraband, who came in about a week ago and began to work for the brigade. Templeton described the man as a very pleasant fellow and works well. Says he will stay with us and go with us home. Two weeks later, his parents received another letter mentioning the escapee, this time to relay the facts of his death. You remember I told you we had a contraband at work for us? He took sick and died very suddenly on Tuesday last. We did all we could for him. He was only sick two days. The doctor pronounced his disease inflammation of the stomach. He was a fine fellow and we miss him very much. ","As slaves fled from their former owners during the chaos of war, they often attached themselves to the advancing Union army. Though some slaves attempted to make the dangerous journey to the states of the Union, the advancing northern army was often the closest and safest option. Everywhere the northerners went, escaped slaves followed, usually to be held by the advancing army as contraband from the enemy. The Virginia-West Virginia border provided a perfect opportunity for many other slaves to escape, as West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863 on the condition it would be a free state with a plan of gradual emancipation for those currently enslaved. Since the state shared a long border with the largest slaveholding state in the Confederacy, Virginia, it was a popular escape route for many slaves. ","As Templeton's letter indicates, the new contraband went to work for the soldiers of the Union brigade. All over the South, contrabands worked for the northern army in many different roles, as laborers, hospital workers, cooks, and often body servants for federal officers. They became a vital part of the workings of the Union army. Slaves were even put to work for the Confederate cause, usually pressed into building trenches or fortifications, and thousands went into the field with their masters as personal servants. By the end of the war, Jefferson Davis was even pressing for the conscription of slaves into the Confederate army, with promises of freedom for those who volunteered. Though this Southern plan was never put into action, the North did indeed recruit and arm runaway slaves, as well as free blacks from the northern states. In this capacity, many African Americans served with honor and distinction.

While this would be of note in itself, of special interest is that in his will, according to the <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, General Blackburn liberated his forty slaves on the condition that they would immigrate to Liberia. Their trip was paid by his estate. No mention is made if the slaves reached Liberia, or if his wife, who survived him by five years, liberated the enslaved peoples immediately following his death. The <em>Annals </em>do stress his evangelical Christianity, including an excerpt of his will in which General Blackburn writes,  I die, as I trust, a Christian, believing as I must in the doctrine for the atonement by the death, the suffering and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ..."," General Blackburn was not alone in Augusta County in his desire to send enslaved peoples to Africa. In December of 1831, a petition with the signatures of 28 Augusta men was sent to the Virginia Legislature asking for their support of United States Constitutional amendment which would give the United States Congress the ability to raise and appropriate money to transport free persons of color to the coast of Africa, and also, the power to purchase slaves then transport them likewise."," A belief in slavery was anything but static in the white South. Rather, opinions on thepeculiar institution varied widely. Melvin Ely's <em>Israel on the Appamattox</em>, recounts how slaves from Prince Edward County, Virginia, are set free, given land, and co-exist relatively peacefully with their white neighbors for over forty years. Yet Ely also notes that Blackburn's response, Colonization, was not uncommon among whites with qualms about slavery, although informal surveys taken just after Nat Turner's revolt seemed to show that much of Virginia's enslaved black population had little desire to move from their birthplace to Africa.

According to the<em> Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the County, it all had started when Maria, one of Dr. McChesney's enslaved children, came to dinner one night very much frightened, apparently having been chased by an old woman with her head tied up. Soon after, stones began to fall on the McChesney's roof in intervals-both at night and day. The <em>Annals</em> record that the stones averaged about the size of a man's fist, and some of them were too large to be thrown by a person of ordinary strength. Occasionally, some of the stones were hot, and scorched the dry grass on which they fell."," The McChesney's tried sending Maria to their in-laws, the Steeles. The situation was no better there. As Maria approached, the white family found themselves with all the furniture in their large room piled up promiscuously. Sods of dirt began to rain down on their house. Soon, Maria began to complain of being beaten with slaps that the Steele's could hear but could do nothing about. Maria would eventually fall down exhausted and the beatings would stop. As the Annals recount, worn out with these troubles, Dr. McChesney, as a last resort, sold Maria, and she was taken South. As soon as she left the disturbances ceased and they never followed her in her new home. ","   Questions of the supernatural aside, a certain paternalism towards his slave permeates Dr. McChesney's behavior-paternalism that Walter Johnson describes at length in his history of the Slave Market, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Much of this ideology implied that the owner knows what is best for his slaves, a fantasy readily seen in the way the slave owner's decision to send the child down South is also her cure.

On a Saturday night in late October 1832, Joseph Wienand, the manager of the Neptune Hotel in Charleston, was murdered. Apparently, he was in possession of between 200 and 300 in cash. His murder was discovered by his African-American female servant at close to 6 a.m. the next day. After repeatedly rapping on his door to awaken him to start the day, the servant became nervous and forced her way into his room. He was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Upon investigation by a coroner, it was declared that he was murdered by strangulation with a handkerchief and by blows to his head with a stone. It was a sad fate for Mr. Wienand, a good member of Charleston society. ","Like any other city, murder and crime were facets of life in Charleston; however, it was not a huge problem for the antebellum city. In fact, the problems of regulating crime were more centered on slaves and free blacks rather than whites. Whether a white person or a black person killed Mr. Wienand is not known. However, it was quite apparent that as time wore on, white members of Charleston society who committed crimes were subjected to more lenient punishments than their black counterparts. In fact, city leaders became so worried about slaves and free African Americans committing crimes that the Charleston Work House was established in 1839. That year, the Work House became a house of correction for slaves. In addition to becoming a place for the punishment of slaves who committed various offenses or crimes, the Work House was also established so that the city would have a central place for a slave market. The work house was run under Spartan conditions and in a correctional manner. Many considered it a deterrent to committing crimes. No one wanted to go to the Work House. In addition, it was designed in a Gothic Revival style, similar to that of many churches built after the Great Fire of 1838, serving as a reminder that the righteous did not commit crimes like that one that was so cruelly bestowed on Mr. Wienand. ","Judging from the murder of Charleston hotel manager Joseph Wienand, one would assume Charleston was unsafe. However, as Maurie McInnis points out in a chapter of her book, <em>The Politics of Taste in Antebellum Charleston</em>, crime was greatly controlled in Charleston during the 1830s and 1840s, thanks in large part to fear of being incarcerated in the Work House.

Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3529,"title":"Slave Sale Comes in Many Forms\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-05-20","end_date":"1836-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["ohn Stapleton, an English attorney, handled the affairs of several Charleston properties included in the estate of Mrs. Hannah Bull. He managed the sale of her slaves, cattle, hogs, sheep and other effects of Mrs. Bull's properties after her death. In a letter to Higham, Fife & Co. dated May 20, 1836, Stapleton detailed the sale of several slaves and included the titles. As the attorney, the money realized from the purchases was received through Bills of Exchange.","In 1836, the sale of slaves was increasing as the need for their labor moved farther and farther south. South Carolina was at an economic standstill; at the time of this letter, Charleston was about as anti-entrepreneurial as it could become. South Carolina's rice culture was in decline, and cotton farms were appearing all over the Deep South. Therefore, many slaves found themselves sold to outlying plantations and other states at a very fast rate. According to Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em> it was necessary for South Carolinians to obtain legal assistance when attempting to sell their slaves, just as Mrs. Bull did. In addition, Mr. Stapleton sold her slaves by private bargaining rather than in a huge slave market. Although popular image dictates slaves were sold in large venues, often there was a lot of behind-the-scenes private bargaining that took place, as it did with this sale. Johnson notes that even though much of the slave trade remained rural and personal like this sale, there were increasing opportunities during this time for trade in large, urban centers, such as New Orleans, Louisiana. ","Selling her slaves through her lawyer may have been one of the least cruel ways Mrs. Bull knew to convey them. Allowing her estate to be liquidated rather than sold through an attorney would have almost guaranteed cruel treatment in slave market, as seen in Johnson's book.

Judge Samuel Hoar of Concord, Massachusetts, and his daughter, Elizabeth, traveled to Charleston in November of 1844. Their intentions were not known when the trip was announced; however, soon after they arrived, it became clear that the Massachusetts judge had come to Charleston to assist the state of Massachusetts' citizens in dealing with South Carolina law. Free black sailors from the Northern state were attempting to load cotton onto Massachusetts' ships. However, those were soon impounded, and the captains were forced to pay a ransom or the African Americans on board would be sold into slavery. South Carolinians did not feel that Massachusetts had any business meddling in their affairs. In a resolution passed by the South Carolina state legislature, they called Judge Hoar an emissary of foreign government, even though South Carolina was still part of the Union at this time. In addition, the resolution declared that even free blacks are not citizens of the United States under the Constitution. It also called for Judge Hoar's immediate expulsion from the city. ","It was rumored that Hoar and his daughter left the city on account of actual mob violence. However, the apparent truth was that they left the city after being asked to leave to avoid violence. Although Hoar was not backing down on the issue, he was also not attempting to have physical harm done to him by what seemed to him as some unsavory Charlestonians. ","At the heart of this issue are South Carolina's unwavering commitment to slavery and its loyalty to secessionism. Additionally, Hoar's experience was perhaps all a misconception and misunderstanding, as many Northern visits to the South were. However, by the time of the 1840s, even free blacks who resided in Charleston were in a precarious situation. Many were not legally emancipated, but had found ways to circumvent the law. Although they were often respected as contributing members of the economic totem pole, they had to tread carefully in order not to make the white elite of the city angry. For the Charleston free blacks, their freedom was only determined by how kind the white members of society felt, since they were not actually free. This is supported by Bernard Powers in his book <em>Black Charlestonians</em>. While he acknowledges the great accomplishments of free blacks in antebellum Charleston, evidence greatly supports that their successes were always at the hands of the elite lawmaking white. No wonder outsider free blacks who had no personal ties to the city were taken hostage. In addition to the fact that they were not legally emancipated, by 1850, free blacks were competing with an immigrant population for jobs. Their whole life situation was always at the hands of others.

While in Cincinnati, he decided that he did not want his former slaves to be subjected to bondage any longer. Brisbane returned to Charleston in 1844. Searching for and finding the twenty-seven enslaved African Americans, he bought them back at a cost of 6000 more than what he had received for their sale. He and newly reacquired slaves departed for Baltimore, Maryland; subsequently, they traveled to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. From there they set out for Cincinnati. Intending to give them their freedom and a head start in their new lives, Brisbane then purchased a tract of land in Hamilton County, Ohio where the formerly enslaved could settle comfortably. ","Did Dr. Brisbane free his former slaves because some of them were his children? Did he free them because he was affected by those around him after he moved to Cincinnati, a locale less in favor of slavery? Neither answer is known. We can, however, speculate that either of these was perhaps the case.

From the idea that African Americans were a lesser race who needed taking care of by white patriarchs to the economic justification, slave owners were always trying to find new ways to dispute those who disagreed with their choice to hold others in captivity. Charleston slave holders were no exception in attempting to find justifications to mask their guilt. Often, religion came into play, on both the slavery and anti-slavery sides of the debate. In 1835, at the end of two long articles about religion and slavery in the Charleston Mercury, it was said that both the Old and New Testament give permission to hold others as slaves. In the Old Testament, God and the Patriarchs approve. As for the New Testament, Jesus and the Apostles show that slavery is permissible. Therefore, slavery, to those who wrote the article, was not an anti-Christian institution. It was just the opposite. Furthermore, they added, it is impious to say slavery is anti-Christian because such a conclusion contradicted God. ","Such extremist beliefs were common in the slavery/antislavery debate. Slaveholders believed that slavery would liberate Africans from their savage-like ways, especially if they were infused with Christianity. As religion ran deep through slavery, white Christian slaveholders argued that slavery was a necessary evil because it would control the sinful, less humane, black race. ","Slave owners, beginning in the 1830s, began to permit black religious gatherings in some forms. In addition, Charleston slaves and free blacks were allowed to attend church with their owners. However, previous slave revolts like Virginia's Nat Turner caused worry that religion would make slaves think they had the right to be free. Turner experienced religious visions that caused him to believe that revolt was divinely ordained. Slaves allowed by their masters to worship were closely monitored thereafter.","Even though the article in <em>The</em> <em>Charleston Mercury</em> claimed that Jesus supported slavery, the Biblical truth is, according to J. Albert Harrill, that Jesus was remarkably silent on the slavery issue. He never outright named it explicitly as a sin. Both sides of the slavery/anti-slavery debate used this ambiguity to their advantage, embellishing the details that supported their case. The slaveholding South stretched the truth and claimed that Jesus permitted slavery. The anti-slavery North claimed that Jesus never said sodomy, blasphemy, and idolatry were sins, even though to Christians, they clearly are. The word of the Lord, to them, did not have to spell out what was right and wrong. Overall, both sides of the debate used religion to their advantage, stretching the truth wherever necessary to help their cause, just as in this article from <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>."],"display_date":"September 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3546,"title":"A Pennsylvania Court Convicts Under the Fugitive Slave Law\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-08-08","end_date":"1851-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the news of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 reached Holly Springs, Mississippi, the citizens were very anxious to see how the North would uphold the laws.

The people of Mississippi knew that slaves would attempt to escape, and hoped that these new laws would help them keep the property in which they had invested so much.

The Homestead Act eventually gave approximately 160 acres of undeveloped land in the west to any man of twenty one years, on the condition that he must build a house of 12 x 14 feet and live on the property for five years.  This would not be a problem for people to fulfill who are coming looking for a life on the frontier.  Albert G. Brown, when he gave this speech on April 28, 1852, was a Senator from the state of Mississippi.  He was a democrat, and believed that the frontier should be settled.  As the Homestead Bill came to the forefront of the Congressional debate, he felt it was his duty as a Mississippian and a Senator to stand up for what he thought would benefit his constituents, the South, and the country as a whole.  People were afraid that this would bring in an influx of foreign immigrants, but he put that opinion down, and turned it around to seem as a beneficial piece of legislation for the North, which immigrants already overpopulate.  Brown though that the Homestead Bill would eventually spread out the immigration from foreign countries, and alleviate the immigration problems in the North.  "," Brown was representing his constituency through supporting the Homestead Bill, because his people of Mississippi would be some of the first to take advantage of free, fertile land in the west.  Fred Shannon studied this bill, which was not ratified until 1862, and marked a contrast between what Brown claimed, and what the rest of the South believed would happen if the legislation passed.  Shannon states that southerners are those persons who are supposed to have been the most bitter against the homestead legislation.  The rest of the South took the opposite view on the merits of increased immigration into the South, and needless to say, theywere not very cordial. The South, in the 1850s, was a place of white social dominance and plantation slavery. The white dominance spanned across race lines and continued to affect the relations with different nationalities.

Langston himself was the founding Dean of the law school and thus, a major contributor to the school's establishment.

As a result of the establishment of black colleges and graduate schools, there emerged a class of black professionals who further strengthened the black communities that were excluded from mainstream white society. Furthermore, it is especially significant that blacks were able to earn law degrees at a time when the rights of blacks had only recently been recognized, and thus, were especially in need of defense and protection.

Many of the men within the Colored Troops had originally escaped into Washington where they labored in the contraband camps, before joining the Union army.

This of course was all made possible by the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which officially sanctioned the integration of African Americans into both the federal army and navy. Although blacks were being given their freedom and were participating in the war alongside whites, they nevertheless continued to receive inferior treatment.

Magnus L. Robinson, editor of the Weekly Leader noted with chivalry that in Lannon's Opera House every orchestra chair was filled with the fair sex--never have there been before such an array of Afro-American ladies at a public meeting, giving grace and beauty to an occasion which is sacred to every true Afro-American. The evening began with a prayer and the singing of the Star Spangled Banner. Letters of regret from those who could not come were read. That of Hugh McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln, reviewed the history of race relations and the attempts to end slavery in the United States. One of his interesting statements was that voting rights for immigrants should be limited, but voting rights for blacks should not. ","The principal speaker of the evening was James M. Townsend of Indiana. He provided a very direct assessment of the state of race relations in his time: But is it not strange, that now, 28 years after Emancipation --after the Amendments to the Constitution--after settling as we thought forever the question of our citizenship, in this country we helped to make and save, that insult is added to injury by the traitorous men who sought to destroy this government, banding themselves together for the avowed purpose of disfranchising, ostracizing, and by some means or other, getting rid of 8,000,000 of the most loyal, patriotic, and inoffensive people on this continent, simply because of their color. He declared his interest in political and civil equality and in a freedom that comes with an equal chance before the law and in business. He recognized that what he sought would be obtained only if African Americans did most of the work of gaining their civil rights themselves, and he argued that blacks should insist on being treated with appropriate dignity. It was all right with him if young African American women spit in the eye of white men who insulted them. ","As Townsend recognized, his fight for freedom and equality was not in harmony with the intentions of the white society of the time. The rights of black men and women, to vote and travel freely, for example, were being increasingly curtailed. Whites began to rely on segregation laws to restrict blacks. Competing with blacks for farm laborers and other resources aggravated many whites. Despite the overwhelming odds, blacks continued to assert their rights. Nonetheless, African Americans would have to endure decades of abuse before they saw any change in treatment.

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual.","The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South.","Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions.

Both were fighting for the same woman even though Joe Dickerson was a free black man. This single duel between Joe Dickerson and George Graham is a reflection of race relations in Florida as of 1892. Florida was no stranger to slavery or free blacks and subsequently created an atmosphere of awkward racial tensions that existed throughout the South following the Civil War and Reconstruction. The love triangle created between a white woman and a man of color and a white man was more than just a dilemma. Inter-racial relations were still frowned upon in southern culture in the late nineteenth century; however, inter-racial relationships were still rampant. In addition, the two men had to meet and converse similar to closing a business deal before the duel could take place. Dueling was considered a civilized practiced in the nineteenth century; a way to defend your honor, and certainly only a man and not a piece of property would be able to defend his honor. ","It was the black man, Joe Dickerson who won the upper hand in the duel and fired before the white man, George Graham, could draw. Consequently, Dickerson fled the scene and his whereabouts were still unknown when the article was published. This interaction between races illustrates the fragile balance between whites and blacks as the South recovered from the Civil War for the next hundred years.

Although the evening had started with a small group of African Americans watching a trial of engines between the Richmond and the visiting Wilmington, Delaware Fire Companies, police soon arrested an African American man who allegedly attacked the firemen.  A riot followed, with the mob hurling paving stones at the officers all the way to the station-house.  Captain Junkins, two sergeants, and one private were all seriously injured.  The incident caused enough of a disturbance to compel General Schofield to arrive at the scene along with a company of the 11 Virginia Regiment.  Although the throng initially ignored the General's demands for disbandment, the soldiers ultimately proved to be a more effective catalyst for breaking up the mob.  ","      Following the incident, <em>The Richmond Whig</em> featured an editorial extolling the white policemen for their marvelous moderation:  When it is remembered that they were all armed, and that they were assaulted and in peril of their lives, and that they...forbore to fire...we cannot sufficiently commend their prudence and self-control.  ","      In this case, the non-violent response of whites was, in fact, noteworthy, as were the violent actions of African Americans.  In the postwar South, blacks widely suffered from brutal beatings and murders as white resentment of the freedom of African Americans grew.  Southern whites who believed in and were accustomed to the racial etiquette between a master and slave frequently attacked blacks for actions deemed impertinent and insolent.  Blacks bidding a white man good morning, for example, could provoke horror in the individual who expected blacks to remain silent unless a white person spoke to them first.  Despite this volatile nature of race relations, however, accounts of blacks assaulting whites were uncommon.  Whites often feared insurrections of their former slaves, but such rebellions rarely materialized.

In the evening, the colored people of the city met and formed a group called the Afro-American League. They wrote a preamble and resolutions against the laws requiring separate railroad cars and waiting rooms for blacks and whites. While demanding change in the law, they also wished to educate the population. Their league's object shall be the creation of a healthy public opinion and they will use the church, the press, meetings, and the court system to appeal the laws. "," Whether this League is a branch of the Afro-American League, founded in 1890, is hard to determine from this one article in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> and Vindicator, the weekly paper for Augusta County. The paper did not say it is, and only listed the fourth resolution. The members said they were organizing a league to be known as the Afro-American League and not anything about being a branch league. The paper made no comment for this event and ran no other articles that day which had racism, black people, or blacks' rights as the subject. There were not any follow-up articles the next week either."," By 1891, Reconstruction had ended, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments had been passed, and Jim Crow laws regulating railroads were already in effect. Jim Crow had not fully seized the South though, and Booker T. Washington and Tuskegee Institute were working for blacks' rights. C. Vann Woodward has noted that by 1890, the hope that Reconstruction and the Civil War had brought was nearly gone. Edward Ayers, however, has noted the uncertainty and lack of concrete rules and regulations governing the South in the 1880's. He also intimated that newspapers bear some of the blame for inciting tension because of their stories and skewed coverage of blacks. This type of story of a meeting was not uncommon because black people continuously worked to retain their rights and gain new ones. They saw themselves losing the enfranchisement and losing the possibility of gaining political positions in society. Meetings like the one in Staunton were not everyday occurrences but groups such as the Afro-American League were beginning to form and trying to exert some influence in towns and cities. A South Carolina woman wrote in her diary that, The negroes are evidently in an excited state. It is important to note that the black people of Staunton had a plan of action. They did not meet to complain about their situation but to improve it. They had a document that explained their goals and beliefs. They knew they had to act and knew that using the court system and press were the best routes. This minority group in a city with 7,289 inhabitants in 1900 made their presence and wishes known to everyone and to those many other readers in the surrounding counties.

He never forgot that he was 'a hero of the Revolution,' and therefore never laughed and rarely smiled. Wadell goes on to point out that Tom liked to use big words.

He promenaded the streets to the public amusement and his own profit in the way of small coin levied by him on patriotic citizens. In Wadell's words, it is possible to hear a hint of ugliness that is reminiscent of the way free blacks were upbraided in Franklin, Pennsylvania in Edward Ayers',<em> In the Presence of mine Enemies</em>. The free blacks were denigrated as saucy and were chided for being too confident in the presence of whites. The same sense of perceived threat can be seen in Wadell's words as well. Tom seemed to hold himself with the respect of a white man for having taken part in the Revolutionary war and so he is called Very pompous and is made fun of for using long words.

That much was certain as they traveled to Washington D.C. from their rural home with Margaret's sister on Christmas Eve, 1877. What wasn't quite so certain was where in the city they could go to hold the ceremony. When they came upon a group of reporters waiting outside City Hall they anxiously asked how, where, and how fast they could be wed. Luckily, the reporters were just the people to ask.  ","Some of the reporters got them through the door of City Hall and to the Marshal's apartment, while others joined forces with some bailiffs to locate a marriage license and someone to officiate the ceremony. It took hardly any time at all before the two were wed in the Criminal Courtroom by none other then Reverend Byron Sunderland himself, who had come running to perform the marriage. This was the very first marriage in the Criminal Courtroom, which was usually the site of proceedings of a very different nature. That a marriage between two black youths could occur in an unconventional location with the help of all kinds of residents of the city of Washington was symbolic of the progress that the nation was trying to make toward equality for all men. ","However, this example of a spur-of-the-moment public wedding between two young, black individuals is more of an anomaly concerning how the idea of citizenship for freed black Americans actually materialized in real life. As David Herbert Donald points out, despite the fact that racial equality had largely been legislated by the 1870s, not everyone was as accommodating as the folks in Washington were that day.  In many parts of the South, there was no one to enforce the kind of treatment the law demanded. Washington D.C. stands out, at least in this example, as a more progressive part of the South, more in touch with the ideals for which the nation's legislators were striving. The Republicans who were in office had passed many laws requiring equal treatment in public spaces for black and white alike; in the case of this marriage in the courtroom, this idea was taken a step further, and the reporters were thrilled to be catching the first marriage in a criminal court room, a marriage of two black people no less. The significance and symbolism of this event is supported by the appearance of Rev. Byron Sunderland, a prominent black clergyman who had advised President Lincoln in the struggle for the emancipation of American slaves."],"display_date":"December 24, 1877","search_date":"1877-12-24","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3598,"title":"The Debate Over Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-28","end_date":"1890-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bishop H. M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3601,"title":"Frederick Douglass Addresses the New American Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-02-20","end_date":"1884-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Prohibition Convention of 1884 was held in Lincoln Hall and kicked off on the evening of February 20th.  Several prominent politicians, bureaucrats, religious leaders and thought leaders of the time were present to help usher the American Party into the upcoming election season. Mr. E.D. Bailey, who had just been appointed to the committee responsible for nominating a President and Vice President of the United States, spoke first and set the tone for the evening by highlighting a few key themes of critical importance to the American Party:  the party's firm foundation in Jesus Christ's vision of Democracy, the growing need for temperance and prohibition, the threat of Freemasonry on the nation, and the highly objectionable way in which Republicans seemed to appeal to the black community simply to win votes before elections.  ","With the mood perfectly set for his address, Mr. Frederick Douglass took the stage to present his speech on civil rights. We have got rid of slavery. It is gone, gone, gone, never to return. But its long black shadow stretches across our entire continent...You ask sometimes when this negro question will cease...It will cease when we have one country, one citizenship, one liberty, one equality for all people...  He then spoke to the issue of colonization, heatedly denouncing it as a unthinkable solution to the problem of racial inequality. He asserted that black people wanted to take part in the freedom and progress that was so unique to the United States, a nation that they were as much a part of as white men. In fact, he elaborated humorously, many whites and blacks may be closer in relation than they might think given the history of interracial relationships in America He even indicated to his largely male audience that, in general, men could learn something from the more compassionate and respectful attitudes of women, who he had known to show the kind of sensitivity and care necessary to bridging the gaps between the white and black races. Every last one of his words was met with applause, laughter, admission, understanding, and approbation by all those in the hall, white and black alike. ","Retrospectively, this speech which occurred in 1884 came at a hugely significant time in the history of race relations in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional less than six months before it was presented at the convention of the American Party. By 1885, as historian Valeria W. Weaver explains, the 'Jim Crow' South was really taking shape, severely impeding if not stopping in its tracks, the push toward the equality between whites and blacks that was the foundation of Douglass' mission."],"display_date":"February 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3604,"title":"The Love and Marriage of Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L.

Hubard wrote approximately twenty letters to each other on topics ranging from the health of their respective families to the passion they shared for each other. Randolph lived in Buckingham County, Virginia and made occasional visits to White Sulphur Springs (now a city in West Virginia) while Hubard, who was originally from the same area, wrote his letters from several different locations around Virginia, including Richmond. Presumably, Hubard's recent commission as a colonel of the Virginia militia in 1858 required him to travel frequently for prolonged periods. During this period, militias sprung up all across central Virginia in response to the call for war. In addition to Hubard and Randolph's correspondence, James' little brother Robert T. Hubard also weighed in on the young couple's nuptials, adding his perspective, insight, and advice on starting life together in central Virginia as well as his dealings with African American slaves.","In his first letters to Randolph, Hubard expressed his concern for the health of his future mother-in-law; apparently, she suffered from some sort of ailment that required treatment in the city of White Sulphur Springs. Eventually, Randolph wrote that her mother had gotten better but complained of lovesickness within her own breast, imploring Hubard to break away from his work and visit as soon as possible. The two clearly cared extraordinarily deeply for one another; with each sighing request from Isaetta, James responded with his own assuaging remarks intended to reassure her of his unyielding love, expressed his regret that he could not come visit, and enumerated the many times throughout his daily activities that his mind wandered to her. The couple's excitement builds noticeably throughout the last few weeks of their correspondence, both writing repeatedly about how much they miss the other and, somewhat peculiarly, how their families long to be united through their impending marriage. In a separate letter, Robert T. Hubard wrote about the sickness of his wife Phyllis and that of several of his black slaves; because the slaves were exposed to a mysterious contagion, Robert decided to have Charity [and] her family moved to the house 200 yds west of Sam's house, as [he] did not like to have sick negroes so near [his] dwelling home. ","The relationship between Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L. Hubard was fraught with the difficulties often faced by southern couples during the antebellum period of the nineteenth century. Hubard, a recently commissioned colonel, was separated from Randolph but managed to save their relationship through his persistent writing. Moreover, the desire of the two affluent families to unite with one another represents a common desire of wealthy southerners to prolong their legacy through intermarriage. Their family's wealth, and to some degree benign nature, is exemplified in Robert's letter regarding his sick slaves. A nuanced reading of Robert's distancing of the slaves from his house reveals a form of racial suspicion regarding sick negroes; it seems as if he was more fearful of what was ailing them due their race than the because of the actual sickness itself. At the same time however, the slaves lived in family units, a condition that must tragically be considered a luxury considering the frequency with which children were separated fromtheir parents and husbands were stripped of their wives in the business of slavery."],"display_date":"August 8, 1860 - November 15, 1860","search_date":"1860-09-26","locations":[{"id":13691,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3605,"title":"Commencement at Howard Draws an Illustrious Crowd\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-05-01","end_date":"1879-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It wasn't every day after the Civil War that former slaves and former slave-owners would admit to having something in common, much less celebrate it openly. But in the early summer of 1879 at the commencement exercises for Howard University, they did just that. The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites. Historian Michael Dennis explains that white Southerners realized the necessity of educating the newly emancipated African-American population in order for them to be able to sustain themselves; however, most were only in support of their education if it was separate from that of the white population."],"display_date":"May 1, 1879 - May 30, 1879","search_date":"1879-05-15","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3608,"title":"Bettie V.

The movement was a period of intense religious activism that trickled down from northern, urban cities and affected Protestant denominations with a heightened sense of social activism. Bettie V. Jones, a resident of Fluvanna County, Virginia, received numerous letters from family and friends, including her husband, William J. Payne, and various other people from and around Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the letters, the Payne family was prominent in the political sphere of central Virginia; included in the letters is a mention of the 1852 Whig convention and the upcoming election, along with a seating chart for the House of Delegates for the 1853-54 session. Jones, a Methodist herself, corresponded with a few Albemarle County residents about the Charlottesville Methodist Church revival, an event that was probably similar to the countless other religious awakenings sweeping the nation that sought to, among other things, counter the assertion that the Bible was fallible. ","Of particular interest to the historian in the collection is a letter addressed to Jones from a family member in Arkansas, a slave state admitted in 1836 on the condition that Michigan was admitted in 1837 as a free state. The issue of runaway slaves is addressed in the letter, a contentious subject that caused a great deal of strife among slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike. The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850, was established in response to the demands from the South for more stringent and detailed Federal legislation concerning the rights of slaveholders and the punishment of runaway slaves. This controversial law further divided those for and against slavery, prompting the increase in the number of abolitionists and the inception and increased efficiency of the Underground Railroad. ","The central tension that is elucidated in the letters to Bettie V. Jones is that of the revivalist spirit and increased moral awareness of southern Americans coupled with the institution of slavery. The collective conscience of the American South was at a crossroads in the 1850s; on one hand, the comfortably profitable lifestyle many southerners had grown accustomed to depended on slave labor as the backbone of their economic system while, conversely, the Third Great Awakening signified a renewal of vigor and strength in relation to the importance of personal religion. In 1845, some slaveholding states left the official Methodist Church to form their own branch, one that condoned slavery on the basis of moral justification by invoking God's will and the examples of slavery in the Bible.

Buck of Fluvanna County, Virginia, constructed a coffin, dug a grave, and buried an African American child for the total fee of two dollars and seventy-five cents. This receipt of service is included in a collection of other receipts and letters; a doctor's bill from one John Thomson, dated December 29, 1840 and a letter from Buck's wife are among the most notable documents that exist from around the same time period of the slave's burial. In the letter from Elizabeth P. Buck, she tells the unknown addressee that her husband is quite and that she wants him to go over the ridge, or into the valley. Nineteenth-medicine had very few remedies for the many ailments of central Virginian farmers, and these sicknesses were often transferred from among members of a family living in close quarters as well to and slaves that may have worked on the plantation.","Jacob Enders' notation of the services he rendered for Buck is nondescript and exceedingly simple. The transaction is divided into two parts, enumerated in column form with the description of his action on the left and the price associated with each deed. First, Enders lists Making coffin for Negro child and the figure of one dollar and twenty-five cents; next, Digging grave and interring same is listed as costing one dollar and fifty cents. The coffin was probably made of simple wooden planks and the burial sight was most likely unadorned, perhaps marked by an inauspicious headstone or cross. The life of this particular slave child exists in the mere three lines of Jacob Enders' receipt.","No matter how historians may characterize certain slave owners as benevolent masters who took good care of their slaves, life on a central Virginian plantation for a field slave was brutal. Summers in Fluvanna County were at times unbearably hot and humid, and the close living quarters available to slaves of middle-class farmers were undoubtedly hotbeds for sickness and disease. The fact that Jacob Enders' receipt is apparently scattered amongst other records from Buck's family and friends, including various other doctors' bills and general correspondence from his wife, suggests the insignificance of the young slave's life. Unlike Robert Campbell, a barber in nearby Augusta County whose life was remembered fondly and was actually memorialized in an obituary, this particular slave child was buried anonymously and ignobly. Though human life was expensive on an economic scale, the only record of Buck memorializing or reflecting on the death of this particular human being is captured in a simple document of sale. The inconsequential regard for African American life and the poor living conditions of meager, slaveholding farmers are demonstrated in this incident."],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3627,"title":"One Hundred Dollar Reward\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-09-01","end_date":"1840-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In September of 1840 a slave named Davy managed to escape from the Petersburg plantation of his master, Henry Davis. Apparently, Davy had escaped with another slave from a nearby plantation.

Davy's companions told his captors that Davy was more than likely attempting to reach a free state. Davy had been on the run for over a month when The American Statesman published Davis' one hundred dollar reward offering for the return of Davy."," From the onset of slavery, white slave owners feared slave rebellions and lost revenue caused by runaway slaves.

Some slaves ran away from abusive owners, others ran away to gain their freedom, and others ran away to be with loved ones from whom they had been separated during the slave trade. The slave trade tore apart many enslaved families. Mothers would be separated from their babies, fathers were sold away from their families, and children were sold away from their parents. When slaves did manage to escape, their owners attempted to locate them by placing rewards for their capture, these ads, written and printed handbills...were ubiquitous in the Southern states.

Furthermore, the fact that Davy ran away with the accompaniment of another captive was not unusual either. When slaves planned to orchestrate rebellions or to run away, they often did it in groups because few states were immune to organized mass escape attempts.

However, this inability to vote was not because it was illegal for African Americans to do so. Three hundred armed white men were standing in front of the registry office in the town of Palmetto in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana to prevent them from registering to vote. After the armed men left, a few African Americans had managed to register to vote and were therefore flogged unmercifully for their actions. Following this beating, the group of angry white men went to the home of another black man, Reuben Stelly. After requesting that he come outside to talk with them, Stelly became frightened and shot into the mob, killing a nineteen-year-old white man. In response, the armed mob fired back into the house, killing Stelly and another black man that was with him."," Though African Americans had been given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment nearly 30 years earlier in 1870, white men of the south were still trying to take a stance against this decision. This incident occurred in 1896; just one year after the grandfather clause had been enacted by several of the Southern states in the United States. A grandfather clause is a phrase used when an exemption is put in place that allows an old rule to apply to particular circumstances, while a new rule applies to everything else. This particular grandfather clause was put into place in lieu of the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local laws in the South between 1876 and 1964 that required racial segregation of African Americans in the majority of public areas. The clause stated that those who had the right to vote before 1867 would be exempt from any property, tax, or educational requirements for voting, and their descendents would have the same exemption. Because African Americans had not been given the right to vote until 1870, the clause effectively excluded blacks from voting. However, it still guaranteed the right to vote to many illiterate and poor white men. As a result of this clause, any African American attempting to register to vote would face quite an ordeal. The type of situation that Reuben Stelly was involved in was obviously chaotic, with racism motivating irrational actions. It was very common for groups of white men to gather in this way to protest the voting rights of black men. When violence erupted from these types of circumstances, it was typical for them to result in an unjust case that was unfairly represented on the part of the black man. Clearly, Reuben Stelly acted drastically because he knew what the situation entailed. The mob of white men did not just want to talk to him; he had registered to vote - exactly what they didn't want him to do. Unfortunately, this situation resulted in casualties on both sides.

The organization - an oath-bound society, complete with grips, signs, and password and the ultimate goal of banishing Jewish merchants, wealthy residents, and negroes from the well-populated parish of Tangipahoa - was highly guarded and only wanted a very small set of people to know of its existence. In selecting members, the group had to be especially careful to not approach the wrong men to join. However, they did exactly that, thus making the clan and its goals well known. Unfortunately for Stern, regulators were notified of the group and served notice on him to leave the area. The other members of the society were given warnings as well, and like Stern, they ignored their seriousness. Nevertheless, Stern and his cohorts did not pay any attention to the notifications, and later regulators sent them more. In an effort to remain in the area, Stern showed the warnings to several of his neighbors because he knew they would stay on his side - he was only a simple business man to them. The resultant publicity of this issue resulted in angry citizens and prompted regulators to force the group not to operate in the parish. "," In the late 1800s, white men and women of the South were still becoming accustomed to living in equality with those of differing race, religions, and viewpoints. Many were not ready to make the adjustment and stood stubbornly in their racist tracts. Groups like Stern's were not an uncommon result of white Southerner's views toward their changing lifestyle. A huge wave of Jewish immigration had just hit the United States, with tens of thousands of European Jews from Russia and Poland coming into the country. These immigrants had left Europe to flee persecution, but were unfortunately experiencing it in American, as well, where they thought they would be escaping it. Anti-Semitism was normalized in the U.S. by the 1800s, just like racism towards African Americans had been. Since the Jewish immigrants had a greater opportunity to be educated in Europe and African Americans did not have as much of a chance to be in the U.S., white citizens were very threatened by the Jew's existence in their country and thought they had a greater potential to take jobs from them, and therefore intervene in the business world and the economy. The first large scale movement against the Jews and other minorities was in 1852 in the organization of the Know-Nothing or American Party, whose creed could be summed up in two words: Americanism and Protestantism. This party, however, quickly split once it entered the world of politics. Stern's group was reminiscent of the American Party's ideals. Though the Anti-Semitism that the Jewish immigrants faced in the U.S. was a serious issue, it was not as widespread and enduring as the racism felt towards African Americans. Stern's clan was a precursor to much more radical and powerful groups, like the Klu Klux Klan, a group advocating white supremacy, which emerged in 1915. Clearly, forcing his prejudice and racist group out of the parish of Tangipahoa was not a solution to the problem and was direct foreshadowing of the horrors to come.

After Pritchard killed Marler, he returned to shoot the dead body repeatedly. The citizens of the parish were infuriated by the situation. Pritchard fled to the swamps. However, other black men had taken up the quarrel for him, and a conflict took place between armed white men and armed black men. Several of the African American men were beaten with a horse whip, and one of them, who showed fight, was shot and killed. After the quarrel, another African American man who was a prominent figure in the ordeal sent letters to two of the white men involved telling them to leave Baton Rouge immediately or face the consequences. The following morning, his dead body was found hanging in a tree; he had been lynched and killed. The situation was looked upon as very serious and armed enforcers with ammunition were sent to control the conflict.","Race riots such as the one that occurred in Baton Rouge between the black and white citizens were not uncommon in the South in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the twentieth century. Southern race relations had not yet mended after the Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863 which freed all slaves, and the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, officially abolishing slavery. In an attempt to replace the social controls of slavery, the Black Codes were enacted in 1885 which greatly limited the rights of blacks, and stated that if they were unemployed or homeless, they would be charged a fine or imprisoned. The Codes were done away with after reconstruction, but many were nostalgic for them and the ideals that they represented.  The Jim Crow laws were created shortly after, in 1877 to racially segregate the South. Though the conflict between the whites and blacks of Baton Rouge was reported to have resulted from the murder of a white man by a black man, the anger between the groups was obviously based on more than the murder. Race riots had been occurring for the past 50 years, and would continue to occur for the next 60 years because of unstable race relations in the South. In 1866, 35 African American men were killed in a race riot in New Orleans. In the same year, there was a similar race riot in Memphis Tennessee. In the summer of 1919, there were 25 race riots in the South. They occurred frequently and often resulted in lynching. Between 1882 and 1968, 4,743 people were lynched, 3,446 of them being black.

Hart, the mayor of the city of Baton Rouge in Louisiana, along with a small band of progressive citizens persuaded local property owners to approve a sequence of bond issues in order to improve the area. One of the issues cost 200,000 and paid for a new city hall, a new school, and paving of certain roads. Other issues went towards making new schools and hospitals and improving drainage systems. Hart's ability to cajole property owners into approving these bonds is commendable because the citizens of the city were infamously stingy with their money, especially in taxing themselves. Part of the funds from the bonds went to pay for a black public school, as well, which was a decision that the citizens were not aware of, and were not happy with. While African American children had been attending a segregated school in the area, they had never received an improvement, and the white people of Baton Rouge did not want them to have one.","Racial segregation in schools and other public systems was customary throughout the United States during the nineteenth century. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 involving the segregation of railroad passengers, racial segregation was deemed constitutional as long as the facilities were separate but equal. The Supreme Court did not acknowledge the fact that most of the facilities in the country that were segregated were not actually equal. However, one of the Supreme Court justices, Justice John Marshall Harlan, favored the rights of African Americans as guaranteed. Harlan protested that the separate but equal decision was an expression of white supremacy, would stimulate aggression and hatred between the races, and would perpetuate a feeling of distrust. Schools weren't the only areas being segregated; hotels, toilets, parks, bars, schools, hospitals, even telephone booths, and separate sections in libraries, restaurants, and move theaters were being segregated, as well, the latter often with separate ticket windows and counters. There were also laws prohibiting inter-racial sex and marriage, which is known as miscegenation. African American schools were required to have African American teachers and administrators, while white schools were required to have white teachers and administrators. White citizens would naturally be enraged if they found out that a black school was getting an improvement that their school was not receiving. However, schools for African American children rarely saw improvements, much less through a bond issued by the mayor. Hart's improvement, therefore, was unique in the South and revolutionary in the changes that it suggested.

Luckily, one of the slaves leaked the information to the servant of one of the passengers who informed her master of the plot. To take precautions against the possible uprising, the slaves were put in irons for the remainder of the voyage.

The brutality of an institution like slavery would certainly only breed a rebellion just as brutal. This was the white Southern nightmare. To Ms. deBree, this story was a close call, a near realization of the nightmare. "," An interesting point drawn from the letter was the slaves' intention to sail to St. Domingo following a successful takeover of the vessel. St. Domingo, or modern day Haiti, was a sort of utopia in the minds of American slaves. In 1804, a violent slave revolt in the small Caribbean country had resulted in the creation of an independent black nation.

The newly implemented Poll Tax Qualifications eliminated their ability to do so. The total amount of white men that registered to vote was 102,723 against only 1,147 registered African American men. What was true of the state as a whole was equally true of individual parishes, as well. Fifteen parishes reported less than ten African Americans were able to register to vote. There was even only a single black man registered in the parish of St. Charles. The poll tax cut down the African American vote by roughly 130,000 men. Only about 35,000 whites had allowed themselves to be disenfranchised by the poll tax laws either because they do not value the ballot, or because of neglect or carelessness.","The voting situation in Louisiana in October of 1900 was not unique to this state alone. The Poll Tax Qualifications required each person registering to vote to pay a tax for their vote. The origin of the implementation of the poll tax rests in the development of the Populist Party of the 1880s and 1890s in the Southern United States. The Populist Party demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of the railroads, a tariff for revenue only, the direct election of U.S. senators, and other measures designed to strengthen political democracy and give farmers economic parity with business and industry. The Populists in the South gave the Democrats the only competition they had seen in the polls since the end of Reconstruction. The competition became so intense that both parties pushed for African Americans to be able to vote in the election so that they could have their votes. However, the Democrats won, and when the Populists were defeated the Democrats implemented various laws into their state constitutions in order to disenfranchise the African American voter. After payment of a poll tax was made a pre-requisite to voting, very few blacks had enough money to pay for it, along with impoverished white citizens, thus eliminating their ability to register to vote. This poll tax lived on for several decades, until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964 declared poll taxes unconstitutional in all states. The large disparity between black voters and white voters in Louisiana, therefore, was common to southern states in 1900 because of the disabling poll tax."],"display_date":"October 19, 1900","search_date":"1900-10-19","locations":[{"id":5666,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3643,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-07-17","end_date":"1830-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":"July 17, 1830","search_date":"1830-07-17","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3649,"title":"A Shocking Scene\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-08-12","end_date":"1820-08-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The passengers of the steamship <em>Virginia</em> witnessed a shocking scene on the afternoon of August 12, 1820. In fact, the scene was so unnerving and immoral that one passenger decided to write a letter to the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> to express his disgust. The episode began when the steamship happened upon a small boat while traveling up the river near Fort Norfolk. Hearing cries in the wind, the passengers spotted a small boat with a sail set, and a little boy, apparently not more than nine years old, holding the sheet and managing the helm as well he could. When the steamship motored closer to the sailboat, it could be seen that besides the child at the helm, there were two grown persons inside, both apparently lifeless. The one a negro man, laying across one of the seats forward, the other a white person further aft, concealed from view by the sail except one leg which was entirely bare and hanging over the gunwale. Quickly a rescue boat was sent out by the Virginia to find that the two people were not dead but stone drunk, and the person lying with one exposed leg hanging over the side was in fact the white mother of the little boy. The two adults had ingested a bit too much alcohol and had simply passed out in the boat, the black man having given the young boy the helm. There was no real problem until the boat got out into the middle of the river where the wind picked up and the vessel became too much for the little boy to handle. Luckily the Virginia happened to be passing by just in time to save the passengers of the sailboat from a watery grave."," The person who wrote the letter to the Herald describing the event, signed only as 'Q. Z.', expressed his disgust at the scene, saying that it was not proper for a man to be so thoroughly intoxicated. However, the thought of the woman drunk and laid out in so lewd a position was loathsome and shocking. The writer of the letter continued on to comment upon the horrible vice of drunkenness which caused the woman to put not only her life in danger, but also that of her young innocent son."," Though the letter can be read as scathing indictment of the consumption of alcohol, the antebellum South certainly did not have a substantial temperance movement. On the contrary, the temperance movement in the South prior to the Civil War was rather weak, perhaps because of its Northern counterpart's links with abolitionism. Furthermore, as this episode helps illustrate, drinking and drunkenness was not confined only to white males, although they did drink more frequently than did slaves or white females. While Mr. or Mrs. 'Q. Z.' may very well have advocated for the prohibition of alcohol, he or she was certainly not representative of the population at large and probably spoke out due to strong personal religious convictions."," Adding to the shocking nature of the scene of drunkenness was the fact that the white woman was in the company of a black man while splayed out in an indecent position. Interracial activities between white and black men in the antebellum South were often frowned upon, but such relations between black men and white women were outright condemned. The United States at the time was an extremely racist nation and blacks were thought of as being not only inferior to whites but actually subhuman. Additionally, white women were seen as venerable to the perceived hyper-sexuality of black males and were to be protected from their advances at all times. The fact that the white woman in the boat had exposed private parts of her body to the black man, or perhaps even the possibility that she may have been in a sexual relationship with the man crossed the bounds of decency in antebellum America. Q. Z. and the rest of the passengers of the Virginia certainly had ample reason to be alarmed."],"display_date":"August 12, 1820","search_date":"1820-08-12","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3650,"title":"A Request from the American Colonization Society \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-07-07","end_date":"1820-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 7, 1820, the American Colonization Society took out an advertisement in the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em>. The ad, which was actually more of an announcement, concerned the need for equipment, tools, food, and other supplies by the colonists whom the Society sponsored. These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3664,"title":"Register of Free Negroes in Washington County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-03-26","end_date":"1856-07-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1838, Washington County registered its 144 free blacks in a notebook by describing their physical attributes. Following regulations set by the state mandating free black registration, James H. Trufs journeyed to the county clerk's office to register himself. The first entry, which labels Trufs as number one, describes him as a dark mulatto. Included in the description is his age, height, and scars. Trufs had a small scar over his right eye, and a small scar on his left fore finger just below the upper joint. John Henderson Miles, number two, had three scars on the left arm, one of which was occasioned by a fork having been run through his arm. John Longley, number 40, obtained his defining scar by a tomahawk. Number 18, George Rush, who had several of his front teeth in his upper jaw missing, had a large scar on the inside of the right leg a little above the ankle occasioned by a scald. Just as noteworthy as the scars were the free blacks' occupations. The occupations included boot and shoemaker, barber, sadler, cabinet maker, farmers, wagoner, and housewife. Of equal note to the scars and occupations was just how these blacks obtained their freedom. Some were free born like Trufs, while Rosannah and Harvey Hill became emancipated by deed from John McCauley in court. Number eight, who had a large scar said to have been occasioned by a cut with a sickle, was emancipated by the will of Jonus Smyth, of the same name that Smyth County was derived. Number four, Theodore Sterrett, was emancipated by deed from Thomas Findlay. The Virginia General Assembly enforced Robert Craigton's will on March 23, 1836 by an act, which granted Delila Boyer her freedom.","Each piece of information noted by the county clerk was taken down with a certain purpose. The scars served as the defining physical characteristics for free blacks. The occupations showed which jobs black people took versus which jobs required education that they would be unable to hold, such as jobs in the printing industry. Finally, the details of their freedom were taken down to have written record in case anyone ever questioned a free black's legality. In the antebellum South, these records were kept like a census. They were only used against free blacks in the wake of major violence. Only in the immediate aftermath of Nat Turner's rebellion and other rebellions were free black registrations used as a list of possible suspects. Once the anxiety subsided, normal race relations between whites and free blacks resumed in a cordial state. Either way, there was a basic need to identify free blacks precisely. In the case of a rebellion, whites needed to know who their enemies were, and in the case of peace, whites needed to keep tabs on who the leaders of black society were for trading purposes and for maintaining race relations.","The information taken down for the records emphasized a stratified society. Blacks, on many of the entries, were not even given names, but were merely assigned a number to differentiate themselves. Furthermore, whereas whites were defined by their status, blacks were defined by how many scars they had and where they had gotten them. It seemed likely that some scars were the mark of white masters when the free blacks were slaves or just a consequence of racial tensions turned violent, because the descriptions of some of the scars seemed almost impossible to have occured naturally.","The very act of registering blacks displayed black inferiority. The very law that required free blacks to register at the county courthouse marked them as inferior in status. One of the aims of the free black registration law was to monitor the movement of free blacks between localities. White people had to make sure that the free blacks did not feel they were too free. The white lawmakers who instituted the law made sure that where the free blacks were free, they were not really free. Whites barred them from the rights and symbols associated with freedom, because the law presumed that all blacks were slaves, so free blacks had to have documents proving their freedom. Free blacks had to walk around with free papers, which they might have to show at any time. The entire concept of registering free blacks in Washington County reflected the inequality that existed for free blacks in southern society. Black people had to undergo so many obstacles that whites imposed on them in order to maintain safety within society. The free black registration underscored a large theme of complex race relations in the antebellum South, even for an activity that was done without violence."],"display_date":"March 26, 1838 - July 28, 1856","search_date":"1847-05-27","locations":[{"id":14341,"lat":36.7495375423,"lng":-81.8835070546,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3665,"title":"A Breach of Contract in Apprenticeship\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-10","end_date":"1838-01-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When Robert Gregory, most likely a white man, entered into a contract with Michael Whissler, a young man most likely white, both thought they were getting a good deal. In return for Gregory giving Whissler six months of schooling, he would work for Gregory and learn the House Joiner's business. However, Whissler left town after one month. Then, on January 10, 1838, Robert Gregory ran an advertisement in the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>. It gave a reward of six cents and a basket of shavings to whomever returned Gregory's runaway apprentice, Michael Whisler. Gregory described Whisler's physical characteristics such as mentioning that the 19 year old was telerly stout made and had an impediment in his speech. Gregory then warned that if the reader did not return the apprentice to him, but instead, harbored the runaway, he would enforce the law against all offenders, without respect to persons. He concluded his reward advertisement by saying, Look out. ","One week later, in the January 17, 1838 issue of the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>, Michael Whissler (not Whisler as Gregory had misspelled) wrote back to set the record straight. In a letter addressed to the public, Whissler argued that since Mr. Robert Gregory advertised him as a runaway apprentice, it was his duty to state the facts in the case. He argued that he was not legally bound to him, and that he did not run away, but was in Martinsburg, where he remained since he left his employment. Whissler explained that the deal was that Gregory would give him six months worth of schooling, but that he only gave him one, and he lived with him till only 5 months remained. Whissler then thought that he had fulfilled the stipulations of the contract, but would have been willing to have stayed with him the remainder of his time had Gregory been willing to send Whissler to school the amount of time agreed upon. Instead, Whissler claimed that Gregory refused to do so, and thought it was his duty to leave him.","This presents an interesting case in apprenticeship in the South. Usually, the stipulations of an apprenticeship contract were that the apprentice would work for the owner for a certain amount of time, and in return the apprentice would receive free room and board as well as knowledge of how to run a certain type of business after the apprenticeship was complete. Whissler's case is different in that Whissler was to receive an education as well as room and board and knowledge of the business skill. Although evidence was not given as to the gentlemen's race, Gregory, the owner, was most assuredly white, because he was a business owner and not many black people had successful businesses enough to hire apprentices in the nineteenth century. Whissler was also most likely white, because of the education stipulation. The standard indenture required his master to teach or pay for teaching in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Since this provision disappeared from blacks' contracts early in the nineteenth century, Whissler was probably white because he negotiated education into the contract in 1838. Regardless of being white or black, there was a distinct relationship that came from nineteenth-century apprenticeships. Free children and adolescents both white and black who were apprentices were bound to serve their master until the age of twenty-one. Once a contract was signed, the apprentice would learn carpentry, tailoring, sewing, or whatever other trade he wanted to learn. White craftspeople had good reason to take on apprentices because they needed the labor. The system gave the apprentice an incentive to work hard in hopes that he would gain enough experience and expertise that he would start his own crafts-making business one day. The greatest aspect about apprenticeships in the nineteenth century was that apprentice terms were finite and could not be bought or sold like slave labor, so parents both white and black would send their children to apprentice for someone who guaranteed that they could not be sold away. At the same time, the owner taught them valuable lessons about mechanical business."],"display_date":"January 10, 1838 - January 17, 1838","search_date":"1838-01-13","locations":[{"id":14530,"lat":39.4640522698,"lng":-78.0275332326,"zoom":9,"place":"BERKELEY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3666,"title":"The Virginia Census of 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The composition and make-up of Virginia was complicated and had changed since the last census, so the editors of the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>, Norman Miller and George A. Porterfield, published the 1850 census of Virginia in March 1851. It showed the free white, free colored, slave, and total population in each county of the Commonwealth Virginia. As the census broke down the Virginia population into the Trans-Alleghany, Valley, Piedmont, and Tidewater regions, the people of western Virginia who read the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em> rejoiced in their growth.","One thing is clear for the region: whites always outnumbered the combined number of free blacks and slaves. Other than that, the Appalachian region was varied in its proportions. Kanawha County had the largest slave population (3,140) in the region with black people, including free and slave, making up 22 percent of its population, while whites made up 78 percent. This was a county with one of the largest disparities between free and enslaved. Pulaski was 71 percent white with 29 percent black. Likewise, Greenbrier, Washington, Montgomery, and Wythe had large black proportions with 15 percent to 20 percent black. In contrast, Barbour County's free black population (214) outnumbered its slave population (113), and the county had a substantial number of whites (8,682), having 96 percent white population. Scott, Wood, Lee, and Brooke Counties also shared a large white population ranging from 92 percent to 97 percent. Most common, however, were counties where the free black population stayed in the low double-digits, while the slave population was substantial, such as in Pulaski county, where there were 3,612 whites, 32 free blacks, and 1,470 slaves. In counties like Pulaski, the large proportion of slaves showed interesting developments in the social climate.","The white population in the mountain region was the highest in the state, surpassing the tidewater, piedmont, and valley regions with 331,568 total whites. The proportion of whites in the Trans-Alleghany region was 92 percent, which contrasts sharply with the proportion of total whites in the entire state, which was 63 percent. Meanwhile, the black population in the Trans-Alleghany region for both the free black population and the slave population was the lowest compared to other areas in Virginia, being 2,482 and 24,436, respectively. ","Slavery had already been prevalent in the Appalachian South, but in 1820, there were large slave concentrations in Kanawha and Greenbrier counties in western Virginia. Over the following 30 years, as these slave communities grew, other places in Appalachia remained void of slavery, such as Jackson County, Kentucky. There was no denying slavery's impact on Appalachia. There were regular slave markets including one in Bristol, Virginia, where slaves could be sold down river if necessary. At the same time that slavery was expanding, antislavery followers moved into Appalachia. In 1827, 106 of the 130 antislavery societies in the nation were located in the South, with a heavy concentration in the Appalachian Mountains. What the Census of 1850 showed was that Appalachia was made up of varied counties. Appalachia had counties where there was a large number of slaves and free blacks, and at the same time, it had counties where there was virtually no black population. Regardless of individual county analysis, Appalachia on the general scale was white. The white population seemed to be concentrated in the Trans-Alleghany Valley, as the white population for that region was 92 percent while the proportion of whites throughout the whole state was 63 percent. Since the Trans-Alleghany Valley contained only 25 percent of the total population in Virginia, it seemed like white Virginians concentrated in Appalachia. This could possibly have been due to the antislavery movement, although it is more likely that the movement was for pursuing land and religious culture in Appalachia."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":14654,"lat":38.3892987778,"lng":-81.5023034378,"zoom":8,"place":"KANAWHA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3671,"title":"Reconstruction and the Ku Klux Klan \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-02-12","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Hamilton W.

His intentions were motivated by a humanitarian desire to assist the freedmen adjust to their new lives. His efforts at ensuring the enfranchisement of blacks did not go unnoticed, however. On February 12, 1869, a letter was waiting for Pierson when he arrived at his home. Adorned with a skull and cross bones at the top, it addressed him as Sir. Pierson was called a vagrant carpet-bagger and a scoundrel of the deepest dye for maliciously interfering in the political realm of the town. The threatening letter was from the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan warned him to stop his efforts at enfranchising blacks and leave the region immediately. If he failed to comply with their demands, they threatened to kill him. The letter concluded by stating that Congressional reconstruction, the military, nor anything else under Heaven could protect him should he decide to not abide by the group's orders.","Upon receiving the threatening letter from the KKK, Pierson left Andersonville and traveled to the nation's capital, Washington D.C. While there, he wrote a letter to United States Senator Charles Sumner detailing his experience. In addition, he included descriptions of various acts of violence against black citizens in the South, and demanded that they be addressed and punishments be enforced. In 1870, Congress passed the Force Acts to help end the violence and enforce the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the Constitution.","The KKK was a secret society created during the Reconstruction era to intimidate blacks and white reformers. The white-supremacist group employed terrorizing methods towards individuals usually associated with the Republican Party. Northerners were often associated with the Republican Party by southerners. This elucidates the connection between Northerners and the term carpetbaggers. The term carpetbagger was used as a derogatory reference for northern whites who moved to the southern states during Reconstruction. They were often viewed as exploiters who were taking advantage of the economic, social, and political conditions of southern society for their own personal gain. Members of the KKK blamed the Republicans for overturning their social order and imposing restrictions on southern whites who had supported the Confederate war effort. They burned black-owned buildings, and terrorized and killed freedmen who tried to exercise their right to vote in elections. Unfortunately, their efforts were usually successful. However, due to the efforts of reformers such as Pierson who demanded that the government take action, the KKK gradually faded away."],"display_date":"February 12, 1869 - December 31, 1870","search_date":"1870-01-21","locations":[{"id":2224,"lat":32.0399997503,"lng":-84.1970888963,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3675,"title":"Chastisement of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-11","end_date":"1864-06-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Emma Mordecai was enjoying the pleasantly cool weather when a very disagreeable affair concerning the servants disturbed her afternoon.

All of a sudden he heard a noise high above him in the sky. The boy looked up and saw two enormous birds swooping and stabbing at each other. They began to get closer and closer to the ground until they completely fell out of the sky and landed right beside him. In complete shock, Pompey did not move a muscle but continued to stare at the birds next to him. Their talons seemed to be wedged in each others flesh. Then, the birds took off into the sky. A couple of minutes later, they again fell to the ground beside Pompey with their talons still wedged in each others bodies. The boy began to approach the wild birds, and without hesitation threw himself on top of them. After struggling with them for some time, Pompey managed to snap the necks of both birds and successfully killed them. He then proceeded to carry them to Mr. Cragwall who quickly identified the birds as Bald Eagles ","This story of Pompey and the two Bald Eagles, published in the Richmond Whig, illustrates a very important idea and concern not just among southerners but among all citizens of the United States. The writer of this story, H.R.P. saw the incident as a direct representation of the current struggle between the two Unions: The battle in the air, is the strife destined to take place between the two great sections of the Union. Pompey represented his own ebony race, slipping in upon us while engaged in mortal combat, and wringing the necks of both. H.R.P. was also very shocked at how many people drew the same conclusion from this series of events. His story illustrates the fact that many people could have predicted the Civil War that would take place almost thirty years ahead this time period. ","Alexis de Tocqueville expressed the same prediction as he said, I shall refuse to believe in the curation of a government that is called upon to hold together forty different nations. They would not be able to avoid ideas of ambition and rivalry, and therefore would eventually have to split. In <em>The Impending Crisis</em>, David Potter states that Tocqueville's prediction was based, fundamentally on a recognition of the disruptive and intractable nature of slavery. When Pompey and the African American race intervened in the already heated struggle between the two Unions, they raised the issue of slavery, complicated the situation tremendously, and drove both sides to the brink of war. Pompey's story shocked many people in Virginia and gave people insight into the crisis that lay ahead.

Northern leaders had degraded you and themselves, he criticized, by inviting the co-operation of the black race with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Confederacy and inviting them into the North's army and navy. Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

Lake placed an ad in the <em>Virginia Herald</em> informing the public in central Virginia that two of his slaves, Reuben and Noah Brooks, had runaway. The advertisement offered a reward for their capture and safe return to his plantation in Fauquier County. Some weeks after placing the ad, Mr. Lake received a letter from Reuben and Noah. They wrote to him, saying that they were currently residing in Toronto. Their letter did not include, however, stories of happiness and joy in the free world. Instead, the slaves told Mr. Lake of their overwhelming desire to come back home to his plantation. They expressed their regret for leaving him, and wished that they had never run away in the first place. Upon receiving this letter, Mr. Lake placed another ad in the paper informing the community of the letter he had received from Reuben and Noah. He asked that if the slaves were seen returning to his plantation they not be harmed or maltreated in any way. "," Mr. Lake's advertisement is very important because it shows a certain aspect of runaways that we do not readily think about. Many fugitive slaves, if they did make it to the North, had no place to go, and no means to live. On the plantation, they were bound to the land, yes, but they were also given housing, clothing, food, and a means to survive. In Slavery in the Cities, Richard Wade states that Free Negroes in the cities [lacked] the money required for medical care, and, had the highest mortality rates of any urban group. Many struggled to find jobs and a place to live while free in the North and were still being treated as inferiors. Wade illustrate this when he notes that the street railway kept separate cars for blacks and that theaters provided special galleries for colored persons. Just because the blacks were free didn't mean whites in the North treated them as an equal. ","The fact that Rueben and Noah Brooks wished to return to a life of bondage in central Virginia demonstrates that they had enjoyed much better living conditions back in Fauquier County. Their story illustrates the idea that many plantation owners in central Virginia treated their slaves very well and that blacks were much better off in a life of slavery because they were abundantly supplied with the necessaries and comforts of life.

After settling in South Carolina, he decided to escape numerous times but was always caught. He received as punishment numerous floggings and lashings; he was also chained and beaten.

Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3704,"title":"The Changing Nature of the Institution of Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-03-12","end_date":"1857-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

This person was no established politician providing aid for victims of the Irish Potato Famine; instead, he was a small five-year-old boy named Joseph Klemm. When Joseph's mother read him one disturbing account from Ireland, his first instinct was to run and get his moneybox. After returning with it, Joseph informed his mom that he was going to carry his money to the man in charge of collecting donations to send to damaged families in Ireland so that his money could be used to feed and clothe the little boys in Ireland. The story of little Joseph is priceless, despite its obvious intention of boosting public awareness and aid to the devastated country. The boy took all of his savings, one hundred and three cents, and gave it all away with the best intentions. The author described in detail Joseph's sparkling eyes, claiming that they showed the workings of a truly generous heart. The author of the article felt that this story was an important account to convey to the public, declaring that such acts deserve to be noticed and commended. He also observed another little boy being entertained by the same story, read by his father just like little Joseph, the boy asked if he too could give his money away to help those in foreign lands.Though relief aid was vital and absolutely necessary for reconstructing the Irish economy, there were numerous disadvantageous circumstances that arose, even with massive amounts of foreign funds pouring in. L. P. Curtis' incumbered wealth illustrates some of these problems. Curtis states that both landlords and tenants depended on an elaborate and secretive system of short and long-term goals. Furthermore, in the post famine period, after the rural economy had become completely monetized, virtually every tenant farmer owed money to someone at one time or another. Despite these shortcomings, it was still acceptable to feel the way Joseph and the other little boy did during such a crisis. After all, it was benevolent acts like these that built up America's character in the eyes of nations worldwide.

The division of slave families was also a regular occurrence when an owner died and passed his or her slaves down to their heirs or designated slaves to be sold in order to pay off debts. As in Beverly Randolph's case, children were completely separated from both of their parents in order to equalize her daughter's inheritance with no regard for the personal welfare of the slave mother or child.

A seat of racial tension, particularly because of an established African American population that controlled many prestigious government and military positions, Hamburg had undergone nearly eleven years of Reconstruction that had, in the opinion of South Carolinian Sam Aleckson, brought some \"tranquility to the state and people.\" Nonetheless, the success of Reconstruction (especially in Hamburg) was blemished when a white Ku Klux Klan mob assaulted a black militia group led by South Carolina National Guard Captain Doc L. Adams. ","    At the time of the incident, Adams' regiment had been parading legally on the streets of Hamburg in celebration of the Fourth of July. Two white men, Messrs. Henry Gatzen and Thomas Butler, approached them and instructed them to move to the side of the road, which they did begrudgingly. This action, however, was not enough for Mr. Butler, and he reported the militia company for \"obstructing the highway\" to the local trial justice, Mr. Prince Rivers, who printed out a warrant against Capt. Adams. This action Mr. Butler carried out in accordance with South Carolina law. The second action Mr. Butler took, however, was much less lawful. Butler related the stubborn response of the militia company to his cousin, General M.C. Butler (an ex-Confederate general and a participant in Ku Klux Klan activities), who took the law into his own hands, demanding that the militia company turn over its legally-held weaponry as well as summoning an armed mob from Augusta, Georgia, to assault the black National Guard regiment.","    Soon after, Butler's mob forced the militia men into a local house and threatened to blow up the house with cannon fire. Weary of this threat, the militia company escaped the building, but was unable to evade General Butler's mob, which murdered five and severely wounded three of the captured African Americans. This violence occurred for no other reason than the company's immediate refusal to move from a public road.","    The Hamburg Fourth of July incident, while cheerless in outcome, portrays race relations in South Carolina during Reconstruction, specifically whites' blunt refusal to end antebellum traditions and accept society's newly freed members.

Owned by a wealthy family in Kentucky who sent him to Virginia for a brief period of time, Watts awaited the opportunity to return home with his son for over a year.  During his time in Campbell County, he \"lost\" his wife and daughter as well as most of his financial viability.  Unable to afford the price of the journey back to Kentucky, Watts wrote to Brown to ask for more money.  He expressed concern about the dissolution of his family, mentioning the state of a fellow slave mourning the sale of his son to another plantation owner.  Yet Watts also made use of his time away: he visited friends of the Brown family, fulfilled his slave duties, and also tried to find a new wife.  Family played an important role in the lives of slaves, but slaveholders could easily break a family apart.","            In the 1830s South, slavery was an institution valued as a source of economic wealth and production.  When it became financially advantageous to sell a slave, or when a slave became an economic burden for his or her owner, the majority of slaveholders had few reservations for selling their slave to someone else.  Historian Wilma A. Dunaway notes that despite a strong emphasis on the family as an emotional and physical support in plantation culture, masters \"devalued the human characteristics of their slaves\" in order to justify breaking up slave families.  While it is unclear how Watts lost his wife and daughter, the urgency he expressed at the thought of losing his son reflects his fear of existing without a family.  ","            Yet Watts also knew of the potential danger in saying too much to his mistress.   As John Blassingame writes, slaves often held back much of their emotion from their masters for fear that their masters would take advantage of or chastise them.  Throughout his letter, Watts flattered his slave-owning family and made them aware that he fulfilled their orders while in Virginia.  The fact that he reserved a place in his letter to ask that his family remain together highlights the immense importance of kinship and the ease with which it could be shattered.  Watts' gender also played a major role in the probability of separation from his son.  Mothers rather than fathers were more likely to remain with their young children because it increased the chance of their children's survival.  Thus, despite his distance from Kentucky and his possession of a small amount of money, Watts knew that he was still at the mercy of his masters.

His work with the Freedman's Bureau led him to buy a farm in Manassas, Virginia so he could be nearer to his offices in Louisa, Albemarle, and Orange Counties. He worked often to secure the individual rights of freedmen that many white southerners worked to undermine. Not only did white Southerners try to oppress the freedmen but the orders of the U.S. Army to their soldiers were often oppressive as well. While working in the Louisa County courthouse, Hopkins noted in his array of cases laid before him on January 13, 1868 that the \"freedmen are being outraged and swindled to about the extent that such an ignorant stupid and yielding subservient class would be anywhere else.\"","    The South under Union military rule was almost as hard as life in slavery for the freedmen. The Union soldiers were ordered to arrest \"vagrant\" black men in the cities and to remove them to the countryside to work on plantations, assuming they were too \"lazy\" to work in the cities. Historian Eric Foner notes that General Weitzel, the U.S. Army commander at Richmond, had \"ordered that before receiving assistance, whites take an oath of loyalty and blacks sign labor contracts,\" forcing the freedmen into essentially a less glorified version of slavery for the sake of the South's economy. The soldiers carried out the harsh orders of the U.S. Army lest they face the consequences of desertion: death.

The petition stated, \"we entreat you to legislate for the termination of slavery in this state.\" Nathan Mendenhall signed the petition, and Senator J. T. Morehead from Guilford County, North Carolina presented the petition to the Senate. The Senate received the petition a few days before its adjournment.  The Western Carolinian Newspaper reported the petition to the general public on January 17, 1839.  The journalist from the Western Carolinian did not write positively about the abolition attempt, and was shocked that the movement was happening \"at home.\" ","    A petition to Congress about slavery was very common at this time.  Congress was force to issue a gag rule to end the constant debate about anti-slavery petitions.  The major issue however, was that the Quakers pushed this petition from a very prominent slave owning state. Quakers were very vocal about their religious beliefs against slavery, which sometimes got them into a lot of trouble. The Quakers strongly upheld the idea that all men are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers also felt the need to obey the law and be moral citizens.  However, these two conflicting beliefs did not stop the Quakers' fight. Many Quakers, such as Nathan Mendenhall, were active in the manumission society.  This was a society that Mendenhall and his fellow Quakers created in attempt to set up new areas in Liberia for freed slaves to live.  Other Quakers owned \"freed slaves\" to keep them from being resold into slavery, worked directly with the Underground Railroad, and were active in court cases dealing with possession of slaves. Due to this obvious protest of slavery, Quakers faced many conflicts with their slave-owning neighbors.    Quakers received harsh treatment and persecution for their actions as well.  These problems caused many Quakers to flee to the new frontier.  The majority of the Quaker population ignored their neighbors' resistance and continued to fight slavery from within North Carolina.  Although the North Carolina Quakers were a peaceful and moral religious group, they still played an important role in the abolition movement from their location in a slave holding state.

Of all the slave rebellions in the United   States, this revolt led by Nat Turner was perhaps the most infamous. Turner's violent rebellion capitalized on one of the plantation class's greatest fears: insurrection. Campbell, in his letter to Colonel Baldwin, detailed the revolt's aftermath, noting \"the whites murdered amounted to fifty-eight\" and that \"excitement and apprehension\" had consumed Virginia. Over the course of two days, approximately seventy slaves, including \"eleven of Richard Drummond's Negroes,\" terrorized the white citizens of Southampton County. In order to comprehend the significance of the Southampton slave insurrection, it is necessary to first understand the brooding concerns of the Southern planter class.","A slave rebellion, argues historian Marion Kilson, \"expresses the realization of the worst fears of the slavocracy.\" Due to plantations' significant dependence on slave labor, an Eastern Virginian county comprised of a larger slave than white population was not atypical. The Historical Census Browser shows that according to 1830 census figures, the population of Southampton County contained 7,756 slaves and 6,573 whites. Because slaves were regarded by the white minority as a form of chattel property that could be bought and sold, potential for uprising was-ever present. Whenever violent rebellion did emerge, Southern sentiment punished the entire slave population in hopes of re-establishing confidence in the traditional plantation economy.","As a direct result of the Southampton slave insurrection, the Virginia General Assembly instituted strict legislation further assuring white social control over free and enslaved blacks. Historian Scot French writes that the Assembly \"banned blacks from preaching or attending unsupervised religious gatherings,\" while Harvey Wish notes that the Assembly strengthened the \"police codes of the slave state[s].\" Wish further observes the fact that because Nat Turner was an educated black, \"Negro education became more than ever an object of suspicion.\" Panic regarding future conspiracies encouraged trials and convictions of many slaves for alleged plots that never materialized.

It was here, in Columbia, that the federal court attempted to provide serious solutions to stunt the organization whose actions had become increasingly violent and oppressive. While these actions by the federal court and the infamous nature of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina created controversial issues in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the \"reign of terror\" by the Ku Klux Klan was temporarily immobilized by token arrests in 1871. ","The Ku Klux Klan planted their roots, under emissary R.J. Brunson in 1868 in Rock Hill, S.C. The Democrats, hoping to win back governmental positions in South Carolina, felt that by intimidating and eliminating the \"negro Republican vote,\" victory could once again belong to the Democratic Party. In Abbeville County, for instance, the secretive, violent actions of the Democratic Party went hand in hand with the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, working together in most cases. In the presidential election year, South Carolina was anticipated to have won steadily Republican seats, but instead, intimidation triumphed democracy.","The violence exploded in the elections of 1868, as Abbeville, Newberry and Anderson counties were entitled \"the KKK counties\" because of the armed mobs and murders that occurred on Election Day as white supremacists employed violence to ensure political upheaval. One Southern man claimed that they [white Southern Democrats] were being \"trodden under foot by an inferior and barbarous race.\" But by 1870, the Democrats could no longer depend on intimidation to win elections and the emergence of the more militant KKK continually gained momentum, primarily for Democratic Party political gains, and of course, in the name of white supremacy. When 2,500 armed whites gathered in Laurens County to violently protest the election results in 1870, violence spread among the upstate of South Carolina. Negroes were pulled out of jail, beaten and murdered by white supremacy members of the KKK. In York County alone, in the course of six months, there was an estimated 304 incidents of violence. Klan violence, though the Klan had been officially disbanded in 1969, arose out of all socio-economical classes in a decentralized format, reigning terror and death wherever possible. The federal government, under Grant in late 1870 and early 1871, respectively passed the Enforcement Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act hoping to put an end to the once again rebellious South through these increasingly strict federal acts. Because of these acts, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in nine South Carolina counties and in most cases, the procedure of due process was neglected.","The trials, evidenced by Evans Murphy's questioning during one aspect of the ongoing South Carolina trials, proved mostly ineffective and as support waned, largely futile. In the South Carolina KKK trials alone, an account collaborated by the federal government in 1873 discovered that 831 persons were indicted and only 27 of which were ruled guilty, 71 persons pled guilty, and by 1875 pardons released the last of the imprisoned KKK members and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was passed in early March. Under the Klan's \"virtual reign of terror,\" however, much violence and terror was accomplished. But those who were caught and testified in court, such as Evans Murphy, created an environment not easily conducive to convictions.

Alderman explained to his audience at the beginning of his speech that a \"Historic Awakening\" was occurring throughout the original thirteen states and that it was important that North Carolina become involved.  Alderman possessed a lot of state pride and felt North Carolina's history was vital to the history of the nation.  Alderman proved this point when he stated, \"in every civil, political, or military commotion of the past two centuries North Carolina has whirled in and done rough, sturdy work and has then gone about her business as if nothing much had happened.\"  He then described how college students should record the history of their home states, claiming that it would be beneficial for the students as well as the North Carolinians who followed.  Alderman ended the speech by listing the different areas of the state history that should be recorded.  ","    Edwin Alderman was born in North Carolina and showed great interest in the state and its history.  He attended college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and later became a teacher and president of the university.  At the time of the speech, Alderman was a teacher at a university he had helped to found as a place for women to study.  Today, that school is the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Alderman believed throughout his life that education and history was important, and was known by his college graduating class as a great orator.  The message in his speech was strong and included many important aspects of North Carolina history.  However, Alderman left out the major historic events that had happened in the recent years.  Alderman almost ignored the Civil War, as well as slavery, in his speech.  ","    Politicians and speakers often avoided discussion of the Civil War during the late nineteenth century because there was a large controversy in regards to slavery and racial tensions.  People hotly debated the pros and cons of the establishing a national emancipation day as well as honoring Robert E. Lee with a statue in Richmond.  Historian William Blair reported that the Confederate flag still flew throughout the South, but many citizens believed it was a symbol of rebellion and disloyalty to the United States.  Alderman was avoiding conflict and hoping to maintain a positive reaction from his audience by omitting some key historic occurrences from his speech.

While this editorial in the New Year's Eve edition of the <em>Times </em>was brief, it nevertheless emphasized that blacks were still a threat to society, especially under the administration of Republican President Benjamin Harrison.  Moreover, the editorial highlighted growing white backlash in Virginia against the rights that African Americans gained following the Civil War. ","            Numerous reasons explain why the editor of the <em>Times</em> criticized Harrison's administration and the situation of black Americans.  Harrison took office in 1888 having defeated Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat.  Running on a platform of \"Rejuvenated Republicanism,\" Harrison received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Cleveland, and he alienated strongly Democratic areas of the country as he took office in 1889.  Additionally, his support for black civil rights and his appointment of Frederick Douglass as a foreign minister to Haiti further angered his opposition.  Cleveland, on the other hand, had supported returning captured Confederate flags to former Confederate states and had expressed federal appreciation of Confederate soldiers.  Harrison's failure to engender support from Democrats and former Confederates resulted in the 1892 re-election of Cleveland in the most decisive presidential election in 20 years.","            The advancement of civil rights legislation that followed the Civil War was a source of opposition to black citizens.  Historians Nancy Bentlen and Sandra Gunning write that after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, \"African American men were suddenly free to enter local and national government during Reconstruction.\"  Philip A. Bruce's publication of <em>The Plantation Negro as a Freeman</em> in 1889 reflected growing white opposition to black freedom.  Characterizing black men as immoral and rebellious, Bruce \"devoted a great deal of time to writing Southern history that directly aided and abetted the post-Reconstruction backlash against African Americans, arguing that as they moved beyond slavery, blacks were inevitably devolving into barbarism.\"  ","            Both the administration of Harrison and the advancement of black rights that took place after the Civil War and Reconstruction gave rise to this editorial.  Its criticisms and fears reflected those of white Virginians across the state, many of whom were staunchly Democratic and still loyal to the former Confederacy.

He conveyed his deep desire to have President Cleveland attend the Lynchburg Fair in October in order to rescue Virginia from falling into the hands of the Mahoneites and out of the hands of the Democrats.  McDonald continued on in his letter to list the various means by which the President could arrive in Lynchburg and depart in a timely manner.  He even stated that he could easily extend the date of the Fair so as to accommodate Cleveland's schedule.

The movement aimed to lower state debt by enacting liberal reforms, including broadening education opportunities for black citizens.  Gaining the nickname \"the party of the Negro,\" the Readjuster Movement won a degree of support in the early 1880s for its financial policies.  Additionally, Mahone sought alliances with Republican officeholders in order to gain more political salience.  Pleas like that of McDonald arose, therefore, out of Democrats' fear of Republican and Readjuster control of state-and even national-politics.  The Readjuster political platform opposed Conservatism, which in Virginia \"was not only a political party, it was also a social code and a state of mind which bound the whites to united and temperate action,\" according to author Charles Chilton Pearson.","            Although Mahoneism and the Readjuster Movement were on the decline when McDonald wrote his letter, they still threatened the Conservative ideals of the Democratic Party.  They also threatened to upset the tenuous racial balance in the state.  In the 1883 Danville Riot, a street fight broke out between blacks and whites over a school board issue.  In Lynchburg, former Confederate General Jubal Early avowed, \"the Negroes must know that they are to behave themselves and keep in their proper places.\"  McDonald believed that staunchly Democratic Cleveland was an effective counterbalance to the Readjuster movement, and he therefore attempted to feature him as the central figure in Lynchburg's 1887 Fair."],"display_date":"August 22, 1887","search_date":"1887-08-22","locations":[{"id":13702,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3930,"title":"Student Withdraws After Beating Slave Girl\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-03","end_date":"1856-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            In May 1856, students and faculty at the University of Virginia were consumed by the news that the faculty board forced a student to withdraw after beating a slave child.

After chastising and threatening the girl with a whipping, Clarke approached the slave's master to inform him of the child's misconduct, expecting prompt disciplinary action.  To his astonishment, the master chose to disregard the girl's actions and Clarke's anger, telling Clarke to leave the young slave alone and go about his day.  ","            Clarke's anger continued to build until he decided to take matters into his own hands late one evening.  Clarke beckoned the young slave girl to his living quarters and proceeded to discipline the girl himself, beating her until she became unconscious and  bringing her within inches of death.       Clarke's violent behavior angered the University of Virginia community.  Many felt that his actions negatively represented the community of scholars and that his actions should be evaluated by the faculty, a common practice at the University for any dishonorable act.  Clarke went before the faculty board, who reviewed his actions.  On May 3, 1856, the faculty board voted that Clarke's actions were inexcusable, requiring him to withdraw immediately from the University.  ","            Almost one full day later, Clarke responded to the faculty's decision in a letter requesting the board to reconsider its final verdict on his case.  Clarke acknowledged that his actions were dishonorable, however, he also wrote that he could have justified his actions with \"sufficient representation.\"  Days later, the faculty board at the University  of Virginia decided to rescind his withdrawal.  ","            The actions of W.D. Clarke and the response of the University of Virginia were particularly characteristic of the accepted social behavior of the slave South during the mid-nineteenth century.  A racially tense white society regularly scrutinized the behavior of slaves<strong>.  </strong>Masters would routinely discipline slaves who acted inappropriately.   Furthermore, it is also important to recognize the social implications that would result from disciplining a slave owned by another master during the nineteenth century.  It was considered illegal to discipline another master's slaves because slaves were the master's private property.    Clarke's defiant and violent behavior toward the young slave girl and the University's response exemplified the gravity of such actions in areas where slavery was a significant aspect of society.

Lane was born and raised in a relatively pleasant environment (compared to other slaves) on a large plantation with over 250 slaves.  As a child, Lane played with the white children, but as he grew up, Lane said, \"I discovered the difference between myself and my master's white children.\"  While they began to read and write, Lane began to work in the fields and was not permitted to touch a book.  However, throughout most of Lunsford Lane's experience as a slave, he worked as a \"body servant and waiter in his master's fine mansion\" and did not suffer the toils of fieldwork.  In fact, he seemed to appreciate living in North Carolina because he said there was a constant fear of being sold to the Deep South, where slavery was harsher.  As soon as Lane discovered the possibility of buying one's freedom, he set to work, night and day.  He began selling peaches and marbles whenever he had the chance and eventually sold prepared smoking tobacco and pipes at fifteen and ten cents each, becoming known as a tobacconist around town.  He worked and went into town to sell his products late at night and early in the morning, living an exhausting lifestyle.  Lane eventually married, and had six children, and raised 1,000 dollars to purchase his freedom.  Lane describes the feeling once freed, \"I cannot describe it, only it seemed as though I was in heaven.\"  Soon after, he bought his entire family for 3,000 dollars.  However, Lane ran into many problems with the North Carolina court, which had many laws about free blacks living in North Carolina.  Lane included all the court documents in his autobiography and revealed all the complex social and economic dynamics that informed race relations in the antebellum South.  His published narrative is not explicitly argumentative against slavery yet Lane's account gave hope and possibility to slaves at the time.

He had finally achieved a dream that he believed would change the lives of generations of young African Americans.  Yancey had overcome the obstacles of racist sentiments and segregation that were a widespread aspect of life in Albemarle County, Virginia. ","    Benjamin Franklin Yancey traveled to Albemarle  County in the early 1890s with a dream to educate African Americans.  He began fundraising projects to raise money to build a school on a former plantation in Scottsville,  Virginia.  Yancey firmly believed that a school for black youths would provide them with the skills they would need to move up in society.  However, as Yancey worked to create such a school, he faced numerous obstacles.  Particularly, the racial tensions that existed in Albemarle  County towards the end of the nineteenth century delayed Yancey's fundraising progress.  However, Yancey worked to overcome these obstacles and he eventually opened the doors to one of the first black schools in central Virginia, naming it the Esmont Colored  School.  Yancey, along with his wife, ran the school and taught young African American children basic skills such as reading and writing.  ","    During the post-emancipation years, African Americans faced great disadvantages in education.  These disparities, which began during slavery, continued into the era of Jim Crow, when black children were forbidden to attend school with white children.  \"Separate but equal\" schools were legalized in 1896 after the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson </em>ruling, however, the schools for black students rarely equaled those for white.   Blacks often faced extremely uncomfortable conditions and less than mediocre education.  In response to reports of these conditions, many educated Americans became active in the effort to educate freedmen.  Several individuals, like Benjamin Yancey, devoted the rest of their lives to the education of newly freed black Southerners.  As a result, schools for freedmen were rapidly being erected across the South.   These individuals embodied the ideals of Civil Rights activist W.E.B. DuBois, who stressed the importance of \"full educational opportunities.\"  Like DuBois, Yancey thought that the founding of the Esmont Colored School would give black Southerners the opportunity to move up in a world without slavery.

Historian Thomas Wertenbaker asserts that medical knowledge in the antebellum South was rudimentary at best.  Especially in rural plantation societies like Virginia and Maryland, doctors were hard to find, and even if found they were not always likely to be consulted.  Many in the South believed that doctors did more harm than good, which is probably true considering their widespread use of such treatments as bloodletting and their lack of knowledge concerning germ theory.  In this light it is understandable why Perkins did not hold out much hope for Betty's survival.","      According to F. N. Boney, a number of Southern doctors in the antebellum period performed medical experiments on slaves.  Doctors used the prevailing belief that blacks were inferior to whites to justify the often grotesque procedures to which they subjected slaves.  They performed many experiments, including the trial of a new (and highly dangerous) vaccination procedure and even an effort to discover an effective surgical method for sealing clefts that caused bladder leakage.  Slaves endured unimaginable pain and suffering due to such atrocities, but in the doctors' minds it was all in the name of science.  Regardless of the means through which discoveries were made, medical science in the antebellum South left much to be desired.  Concepts that are considered self-evident today, such as germ theory, were unknown at the time.  Perkins described most of his traveling as such: it \"...was water Bound three times and was very mody....\"  Frequently surrounded by water and mud, his traveling party must have come into contact with an untold amount of pathogens.  Although these days it is viewed as common knowledge, many people in the antebellum South may have had no idea that such conditions could be breeding grounds for disease.

He stated simply, \"I acknowledged their freedom; did not expect them to work on the old terms, but would pay them for their labor, etc.\" Pinckney respected the knowledge of the land and agricultural work that these men had acquired while working for him, and for this reason he wished them to stay on his plantation. After his request, Pinckney received a largely negative response from these former slaves. Acknowledging their rights as free men, Pinckney told them that if they were to stay on his land they would have to work for him, but they were free to go wherever they wanted. The slaves found themselves in a frustrating bind. Fearing the failure of the federal paper currency (greenbacks), they wished to work for themselves instead of Pinckney employing them. They questioned the actions of the government, asking \"what good does it do for the government to give us our freedom and not give us land to plant?\" Pinckney, probably like most former plantation owners, was equally frustrated because his livelihood relied on the productivity of his plantation, and he could not possibly do all the work himself.

On Pinckney's plantation they were \"generally forced to adopt the share system.\" This share system became common throughout the South in the years following the war. In the early stages, the plantation remained the most common unit with free men working on it for a share of the crops, but soon enough a true sharecropping system developed. Black men were granted pieces of land to work, and when the year was over the owners returned to them a share of the crop produced. By 1870 sharecropping was so common in the South that it made any other system seem unusual.

One of the most important temperance organizations was the Women's Christian Temperance Union, created in 1874.  Other local temperance efforts, such as this picnic, occurred throughout the nineteenth century.  ","Religious and racial tensions plagued many temperance efforts. Most of the temperance women were evangelical Protestants who often criticized the Irish Catholics and Germans frequently associated with alcohol consumption and production.  Discord also existed between blacks and whites, as some white women claimed that black men were especially a danger with alcohol.  Although these apprehensions existed, for the most part the temperance movement was successful in incorporating women of various \"socio-economic, racial, religious, and national identities.\" Many women used the Bible to justify temperance; they claimed that it was God's plan for women to help the men and \"most commonly likened women...to Christ's apostles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> does not mention the demographic or religious background of the picnic's guests having had any effect; in fact, it says there \"was no disorder.\" This furthers the idea that locals were unified by a common aspiration. ","Although temperance is traditionally associated with women against alcohol consumption, at the time, it was just as important in promoting white women's overall equality.  For example, the WCTU helped educate women \"to take on public personas because the nineteenth century offered [them] limited formal education in rhetoric.\"  Often, people saw the strive for equality as radical.  Thus, as historian Carol Mattingly writes, \"newspaper reporting focused largely on issues of gender rather than on the subject of temperance\" which she says \"reflects a general discomfort with women's changing roles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dot</em>s, on the other hand, presents an article focused on the issue of temperance as opposed to gender.  This is likely because the focus of their gathering was \"not yet Congress, Legislature, Judge, Jury, Church or state;...but the Rum Traffic, was the prisoner at the bar.\" Long-term changes for women, such as the Nineteenth Amendment, would not occur for some time. Still, the nineteenth-century temperance movement fueled the steps towards gender equality.  Events such as the Shenandoah County Temperance Picnic, although small, represented a larger movement that took place throughout the South."],"display_date":"June 28, 1888","search_date":"1888-06-28","locations":[{"id":14271,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3956,"title":"The Education of African Americans After the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-01-01","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Our crops are poor on account of too much wet in the summer which prevented us from working with them,\" John McClure, a resident of Albemarle  County, wrote to his aunt and uncle.  He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.  Unfortunately, though, with the turn of the century, Edward Ayers notes that \"blacks in the south paid for schools for whites--not the other way around.  The more black citizens in a county, the greater the benefits to white students.\"  Racial tensions would not disappear for some time."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":13600,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3958,"title":"To Protect and Serve: Overlooked White Crimes\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-09-03","end_date":"1890-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The black woman was badly injured.  She had been close to death for several days and her family was stricken with feelings of uncertainty and anger.

The family maintained hope that they would finally see racial equality and justice converge.  Unfortunately, however, the day that the beaten woman would receive the justice she truly deserved would never come. ","            On September 3, 1890, Policeman Saunders was on duty, patrolling a largely white neighborhood in Charlottesville,  Virginia.   He focused his attention on an innocent black woman who seemed out of place in the area.  After questioning the \"suspicious\" woman, Policeman Saunders decided to arrest her.  The woman resisted the seemingly unwarranted arrest and the result was bloodshed.  The police officer brutally beat the woman over the head numerous times with his billet.  As news of the savage beating spread throughout Charlottesville, individuals of the black community banded together, demanding that the officer be tried for excessive and unjust force.   The demands of justice by the black community were ignored by the white politicians and the police officer went unpunished.  ","            Black inferiority was an uncontested aspect of the South during late 1800s.  The failure of Reconstruction allowed blatant racism to become an accepted part of the Southern states.   Whites often used violence to instill fear in the minds of black Southerners in an attempt to regain the level of control which they had prior to the Civil War.  This rampant violence and widespread fear shaped and defined the relationships between blacks and whites during the late nineteenth century.   To remedy this overt discrimination in the Southern states, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which made it illegal to discriminate against blacks by assigning them an inferior legal and economic status.  Approximately two years later the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing \"equal protection of the laws\" to every American citizen.   In response to this legislation, however, the Southern states passed a new set of laws that \"permitted local officials to informally discriminate against blacks.\"   The actions of the Southern states following national legislation indicate a desperate effort to retain a position a position of superiority over newly freed black Southerners.  Unfortunately, the desperate attempt to maintain a sense of white supremacy in the South resulted in the disappearance of any form of legal justice in the black community.  The absence of legal action against Policeman Saunders is just one example of the widespread acts of injustice which plagued blacks across the United   States following the abolition of slavery.

His cotton crop had failed and his debts were quickly mounting.  In an 1843 letter to his brother, who lived in Staunton, Virginia, Kinney proposed multiple methods to earn some quick money to satisfy his debtors.  The most promising option was to begin actively engaging in the slave trade.  Young healthy slaves could often sell for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  The recent migration of planters to the Mississippi Delta from the Chesapeake region had increased the demand for slaves even further.  Even some people from the North came to the region in order to enjoy the economic prosperity of the area.  Some of the migrants came not understanding slavery or even believing that it was unnecessary but ended up purchasing slaves nonetheless.  ","            Kinney defended his decision to become active in the trade of slaves.  This is interesting because his brother, as a resident of Virginia, likely owned slaves himself or was at least exposed to slavery on a daily basis.  In fact, many slaves from Virginia and Maryland were sent to the Deep  South where the demand was much greater for them.  This was because the tobacco boom had come and gone in the Chesapeake while the cotton and sugar rush was just beginning in Louisiana.  The struggling farmer told his brother that the slave trade \"is both a positive good for master and slave.\"  It is easy to see what \"positive good\" the master received, but Kinney failed to mention how this process was beneficial to the slave.  He must have forgotten that slaves were often separated from their families and forced to start life anew whenever they were sold, causing much grief and heartbreak.

General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to the Union and effectively destroyed any chance of her beloved Confederacy succeeding in its war effort and becoming a separate and distinct nation. For Emma, the only highlight of the month appeared in the assassination of President Lincoln: \"After all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light.\" A common, unfortunate theme throughout her April diary entries was the rationing of food and a severe lack of funds available for more than the basic necessities. Though wearing homespun versus store-bought clothing items was a minor disturbance compared to the lack of food, her accustomed wealthy way of life was ruined. LeConte tried to keep some of her former lifestyle of leisure by trading French lessons for German coaching with a family friend, but as she realized that her usual \"Old South\" lifestyle was gone forever, her desperation set in.","The Confederate surrender would be the start of only harder times for South Carolinians like the LeConte family as well as other Southerners. Lee's formal surrender at Appomattox brought down the Confederacy in one written swoop. Economic times were already tough in the South, as most white men had mobilized with the Confederate armies and were unable to keep a steady eye on their farms at home; meanwhile, slaves voluntarily freed themselves from bondage without their masters' watch. Most women were powerless to run family businesses. The combination of these situations dropped the South into destitution even before the Civil War ended. Unpaid debts between Southerners and annihilated commercial centers such as Charleston and Columbia added further to the South's woes. Impoverishment became the rule - not the exception - in the ex-Confederate states, a situation that remained until the twentieth century.

Though her concern for her father's ill health was quite natural, it was quite surprising to learn of her distaste for such a grand and important Southern city such as Charleston and her accompanying lack of \"any desire to visit town.\" Her large amount of leisure time, however, exposes Mrs. Huger's status as an elite white Southern woman. This detail is further expanded when she asked Mrs. Lowndes to buy her some material the next time she went to town \"for my gown, which I cannot finish\" without the proper material.

The elevated role of rich white women took a devastating turn, however, after the collapse of the Confederacy and the emancipation of slaves. As plummeting cotton prices forced the South into economic destitution, many women did not have the option of maintaining their work-free Southern womanhood and survived solely because they helped their husbands in the fields. Labor would have been considered absolutely improper for elite women before the war. Not only were the former Southern belles working in the fields, but Southern women were also responsible for the upkeep of the family home - this time without the help of slaves.

Advertisements present in the Norfolk-based newspaper attempted to sell goods such as Christmas supplies, hats, and chlorine tooth wash. While these impersonal objects were goods commonly traded and sold in the marketplace, the advertisement section also included references to Southern property that had run away from their masters. Perhaps the most telling aspect of these advertisements was that no significant distinction was made between missing cattle and missing slaves. To the slave master, steers and slaves were equal under the nature of the law: both were fundamental illustrations of private property. ","To comprehend the importance of the <em>Beacon's </em>advertisements, it is essential to understand the Southern belief that slaves were inherently the property of their masters. This prevalent reasoning had predated the Constitution and was deeply entrenched in Southern culture by 1832. Records from the debates of the Constitutional Convention, presented in the <em>Cambridge Modern History</em>, illustrate that Southerners held a consensus that \"slaves were property only; like other property, they were entirely subject to the wills of the master.\" This conception was no different from the perception regarding steers. In the two advertisements aforementioned, the descriptions of the missing cattle and runaway slaves relied solely upon physical peculiarities. While the two missing steers had \"marks under half moon under the right ear,\" the runaway slave named Lucy was \"stout\" with a \"very yellow complexion.\" In both circumstances, vested rights in private property possessed by the plantation owner dictated that the property be returned. ","The Southern perception of slaves as \"chattel property,\" mirrored in the two advertisements of the <em>American Beacon</em>,<em> </em>supports an underlying observation that blacks and cattle held equal rights under <em>de facto</em> Southern law. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"chattel\" is defined as \"a personal possession.\" As previously stated, slaves in the South were considered \"property...subject to the wills of their masters.\" The words \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" share a common language origin; both terms come from the Old French word \"chatel,\" which arises from the Latin word \"caput,\" meaning \"head.\" By relegating slaves to the restricted rights and properties of chattel, slave owners fundamentally equalized the rights of slaves and the rights of cattle. As a result, listing rewards for runaway slaves next to advertisements for runaway cattle, chlorine tooth wash, and medical elixirs was not conflicting in either intention or theory.  ","From expressed Southern mentality and advertisements found in the <em>Beacon</em>, it becomes readily apparent that blacks and whites were not regarded as equal beings under the encompassing mantle of equal protection. Blacks, bought and sold as mere chattel, were only regarded as equals to steers, \"glass beads,\" and \"harmonical walking canes.\" The subsequent equality under the law and inherent relation between steers and slaves was a founding principle of the Southern plantation economy, helping preserve the institution of slavery until the conclusion of the Civil War.

We will be pleased to know that the unpleasant matter is settled.\" ","On December 30, 1885, Phillip Haxall, President of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, penned the preceding sentences in a letter to Chairman William H. Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency.

Parmalee's commentary on the sectional crisis echoed the sentiments shared by many Southerners at the time. \"We are, as a people, in a state of considerable political excitement,\" he wrote of the Southern attitude. Parmalee then went on to discuss Southerners' desire for \"equal rights under the Constitution,\" a fundamental principle that Congress had, in his opinion, violated.

It had been deeply rooted in Southern culture for decades, and the recent rise of the abolitionist movement threatened that lifestyle both economically and socially. Southerners justified the institution of slavery on historical, Biblical, racial, and moral grounds.

Reed's journal entry certainly proves this, for she observed the frightening picture of \"an innocent, peaceable negro all thought, taken from his frightened wife, taken out, his house searched, and (then) he was shot and left lying in the street the next morning.\" All this occurred due to the vengeance of a lynch mob operating in the town of Anderson, yet according to a traumatized Reed, \"no [citizen] knows who perpetrated the dark deed - nor for what reason - all excitement.\" Such occurrences of racism were not only common during early Reconstruction, but would also continue to appear for quite some time in South Carolina and across the South, proving that many whites in the region remained \"strongly committed to white supremacy.\"","     Reconstruction in South Carolina and in the rest of the former Confederacy was meant to turn the tides of racism and inequality that had been entrenched in the region for nearly two hundred years. In the long run, this racism would die out. Nevertheless, early Reconstruction strayed far from its purpose, a tolerance and freedom meant to apply to <em>two</em> races for the first time. More accurately, early Reconstruction efforts led to a southern culture of racial despair and hostility, one considered by Emmala Reed to be \"a horrible, disorganized state of society.\""],"display_date":"June 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-08","locations":[{"id":11429,"lat":34.519117434,"lng":-82.637883414,"zoom":9,"place":"ANDERSON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3988,"title":"Black Code in Mississippi\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-12-11","end_date":"1865-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A small article on the front page of <em>The Natchez Democrat</em> on December 11, 1865, described a conflict between state militia and black freedmen almost two weeks earlier.

This legislation not only limited the rights of the freedmen, but also made it clear that white society in Mississippi was determined to keep the black citizens on the lowest rung of society.

She had an entry for each day during these two years in which she talked about such things as her clothing, visits made by family and friends, the weather, and illnesses.  Included in her diary were brief mentions of her slaves, who had been recently hired out to other plantation owners at the beginning of her 1858 diary.  As she talked about the hiring-out of her slaves she stated, \"I am so worried about the servants, do hope they will get comfortable homes and do well.\"  A concern for the well being of her slaves was evident in her diary as she explained her worries and wishes for the comfort of her former servants.  Her tone was genuine and exemplified how a slave-holding woman of the South could truly care for her servants, and that her concern was not completely related to the productivity and efficiency of her workers.  Furthermore, when talking about another one of her black workers, Charles, and his sale, she said she, \"...witnessed to Charles's bill of sale.  I am sorry for him, but he has brought it on himself by his obstinate conduct.\" Despite apparent disorderly conduct, she did not exhibit disrespect for this slave. ","Southern women's perspectives were often not the forefront of the Southern mindset during this time period.  Although much literature focused on the male political turmoil of the slave South, many women of this time exhibited much softer emotions toward their slaves.  In her book, Within the Plantation Household, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese argues that southern slaveholding women were not unlike their male counterparts and commanded dominance over their slaves.  She also stated that southern white women even went as far as to defend slavery as an integral party of society.  Genovese's argument presents a contradiction to the attitude of Fannie Page Hume. Although Genovese wrote of the dominance of southern women over their slaves, Hume may portray an internal conflict that many of these women struggled with.  The sense of dominance may have been a faÇade as a method to retain white supremacy, while in reality many women experienced the same empathies of Fannie Page Hume toward their slaves.  Hume's sympathetic writings towards her slaves could have been done in secrecy while her actual practices were more akin to that of white supremacy."],"display_date":"1858 - 1859","search_date":"1858-12-31","locations":[{"id":14128,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3995,"title":" This Sin Polluted Earth\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-03","end_date":"1857-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On January 3, 1857 cries of pain echoed throughout the plantation.  The crack of the whip onto bare skin had an unmistakable sound.  All those who witnessed the brutal whipping cringed with each crack.

Mary Boyden became used to seeing her father discipline unruly slaves, but this time she became disgusted with his behavior.","            Before Mary went to sleep on the night of January 3, 1857, she wrote in her diary as she did every night.   Normally, Mary would write about the weather and the people she had met throughout the day.  This entry, however, had a particularly different focus. Mary began this entry with the thought, \"another day has dawned upon this sin polluted earth,\" followed by an emotional, detailed description of the brutal whipping of a slave that she had witnessed early in the day.  Her father, an overtly bigoted, violent man, had senselessly beaten a slave in an attempt to solidify his superiority over the less-than-human slaves who worked on the plantation.  His futile actions had disgusted Mary, a religious adolescent girl who tended to sympathize with the slaves that her family had owned.  Mary had developed a substantial internal conflict between her personal ideals and the beliefs encouraged by her Southern Baptist religion. ","            Mary wrote about her personal hatred and disgust with the Southern culture, which heavily revolved around slavery.  She did not agree with the idea of slavery and wrote, \"white folks will have to pay for making slaves of the black folks, in the insurrection.\"  Mary no longer wanted to experience the routine whippings of the slaves, whom she had developed close relationships with.  She longed for a way to remove herself from the life that her family was so deeply imbedded in.   ","            Conflict between religion and slavery was not an uncommon dilemma in the slave South during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War.  Many deeply religious slave owners were even troubled by their own involvement with slavery.  Some slave owners who were particularly religious considered the institution of slavery to be evil and were often convinced that they would be going to hell.  However, Southern Christian churches often supported the idea of slavery.   Religious communities considered the institution slavery in terms of its social, political, and economic consequences as well as in terms of its ethical implications.  The majority of the religious communities, however, feared that emancipation would lead to devastating effects.   Slave owners used the views of their churches as a foundation to rationalize or justify their own involvement in slavery.  As a result, many slave owners considered slavery an economic and political issue that was beyond their control and ignored the ethical issues surrounding the institution.  Mary Boyden embodied this internal conflict which existed between her own ethical beliefs, her religion, and her family's use of slaves to bring in revenue.  This conflict proved to be a crucial weakness for many southerners fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

Racial discrimination persisted throughout the country but Jim Crow laws and racial segregation originated in the North and were not widespread in the Southern states before 1900.

Charles' abrupt disappearance enraged his master, John C. Kerric. On November 22, 1851, Kerric wrote an impassioned letter to his friend, Robert T. Hubard, describing his unfortunate situation. Kerric explained that Charles ran away and was purchased by a plantation owner on the \"other side of the mountain.\" He questioned the legality of this man's purchase and asked Hubard to seek legal advice on the situation from a presumed lawyer and friend, Benjamin Graham. Also, Kerric sought to defend his social standing as a good master, proclaiming that he had established a decent house for his slaves and could not understand why Charles ran away.","After receiving Kerric's letter, Robert Hubard immediately initiated correspondence with lawyer Benjamin Graham. In his reply, Graham spoke first of the legal ramifications associated with the purchase of a runaway slave. Graham declared that a man's slave is his property for life, so Kerric still legally owned Charles. Graham also argued, however, that he understood why Charles had run away, explaining that Kerric was a \"cruel and harsh\" master. Even more, Graham defended the plantation owner who purchased Charles, complimenting his \"good plantation and content workers.\" Hubard relayed the lawyer's message to Kerric, and Kerric decided it would be best to sell Charles and end his trouble.","During the years preceding emancipation, planter society highly valued the ideal of paternalism. According to historian Drew Gilpin Faust, \"paternalism is the belief in a sense of stewardship, where some men are divinely appointed to be the guardians of others, justifying slavery as a positive good.\" The ideals of paternalism instructed masters to treat their slaves as a father would treat his child. Paternalism instigated a system of mutual obligation between slave and master; where slaves who were treated well were expected to act obediently. Most southern planters reasoned that in caring for slaves, in leading them out of barbarism, they were fulfilling God's will.","The correspondence between John Kerric, Robert Hubard, and lawyer Benjamin Graham illuminates many of the fundamental principles of paternalism. Drew Faust explains that paternalism was a social response to the South's obsessive fear of slave insurgency, seeking to control blacks as individuals and a race. The fear of slave insurgency, as in Kerric's situation, motivated many planters to take an interest in their slaves' well being. In the eyes of Kerric's community, his misfortune was warranted because he treated his slave harshly. The letters also illustrate that men who exercised paternalism were granted a certain level of respect. In his letter to Hubard, Kerric expressed deep fear that neighboring planters would cruelly criticize and judge him because of his slave's disappearance. Graham heightened this point by complimenting Charles' new<em> </em>master for his \"good plantation and content workers;\" insinuating that he might have been a better fit master than Kerric. Overall, paternalism provided an ideological and emotional context in terms of which individuals approached slavery and within which they legitimated their consequent social actions."],"display_date":"November 1851","search_date":"1851-11-15","locations":[{"id":13889,"lat":36.6763018346,"lng":-77.5590329782,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENSVILLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4012,"title":"Moral vs. Immoral: Exploring Slavery in Florida\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1849-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"He called the slave owners worse than house thieves and we laughed at the old fool for his ignorance,\" said Margaret Lynn Lewis in a 1849 letter to her son John Lewis Cochran.  As members of the planter class, the Lewis family relied on slave labor in order to maintain their farm. "," The use of slave labor in Florida was centered on King Cotton, which was essential to the prosperity of the South.  The emergence of slavery in Florida began with the development of the Georgia-Florida frontier, where most believed that slaves were property rather than human beings.  Furthermore, many Floridians feared that the Seminole Indians would threaten southern dominance over their slaves.  Floridians were very suspicious that the Seminoles allied with their slaves and planted thoughts of escape in their minds.  Having forced the Seminoles into the interior swampland of Florida during the Seminole Wars, the United States never extracted this community and eventually handed reserve territory over to the tribe.  Thus, the Seminoles of Florida became a combination of runaway African slaves, indigenous people, and impoverished people from various cultures following the United States' displacement and extermination of their traditional culture. ","Against the current treatment of the slaves, the anti-slavery movement opposed many, if not all, concepts of the southern outlook on slavery.  Despite this, the anti-slavery movement did take hold in parts of the South. A select few accepted the belief that slavery was immoral and should be abolished.  Holding beliefs contrary to those of their southern counterparts, some abolitionists were tried and imprisoned for such \"radical\" thoughts concerning slavery.  In the 1849 letter, Margaret told her son of one man who had been imprisoned in Jamaica for \"exciting the negroes to rebellion.\"  Such a strict punishment for the opposition of slavery illustrated the use of slavery as a crutch that steadied the South, both economically and socially, before the Civil War.

Each household was numbered and every person who lived in the house was included within the family. Each family had to report every person who lived in the house as well as their gender, age, and place of birth. Additionally, the census reported the value of each estate, occupation of the residents, and the number of slaves on each farm.

While most household heads reported their main occupation as either laborer or farmer, very few concluded that they owned more than one slave. In fact, those households that owned at least fifty slaves or more typically reported an additional primary occupation, such as the Flood family, where Henry D. Flood, the head of the family, was an attorney. Additionally, very few masters who owned at least fifty slaves were under the age of fifty.

Several farms grew tobacco in order to earn more income, but few farmers made a large profit.

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was hardly enforced and northerners did not help in retrieving runaways. Because of this the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 made any official who did not detain a slave accountable to a fine, and officials had a duty to arrest suspected runaways. This law hit a blow to abolitionists, who protested it. Berry's decision to solicit the help of the readers of the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> could indicate northern resentment of the new Fugitive Slave Law. Berry could not trust that his slave would be returned by federal law alone and hoped to receive greater aid in his slave's capture.","Runaway slaves reduced productivity, cost their masters money (in rewards as well as other fees such as detaining the slave), and took away their masters' time.

Bramlette agreed that the \"evil necessity\" had become an \"incumbus upon our energies, a burden to our advancement, and a negative to our prosperity.\" ","As a border state, Kentucky lacked the labor-intensive staple crops, such as cotton and tobacco, that were necessary to support slavery, and the average size of slaveholdings in Kentucky was the fourth smallest in the South.  With a long history in the antebellum years of moderation and compromise, Kentucky provided an atmosphere conducive to antislavery advocates.  However, even such advocates lacked a willingness to take firm action.  Most believed that slavery was a necessary instrument for controlling the state's black population.  During the war, Kentucky became firmly committed to the Union yet remained governed by a coalition opposing all policies that challenged slavery.  State officials denounced the Emancipation Proclamation as unconstitutional and refused to recognize the liberty of any black person claiming or pretending to be free.  It is this very resistance that General Brisbin so ardently disfavored in his letter: \"slavery is at an end, and why deny it, or, by withholding proper State legislation, seek to retain longer the shadow of an institution that was always worthless?\"","Brisbin advanced his argument by describing the condition of slavery and labor in Kentucky.  He wrote, \"the master can no longer hold his slaves or depend on their labor for a single day, so that producers cannot calculate their crops or pursue agriculture with any degree of certainty.\"  Indeed, the war undermined the exclusive authority of master over slave.  Slaves quickly learned that authority and protection resided with the Union army when unionist slaveholders could not protect their slaves against Confederate invaders.  Conversely, when federal military lines moved into areas previously held by Confederate forces, slaveholders who had sympathized with the Southern army fled, leaving property and slaves behind.  Most of these abandoned slaves immediately assumed the stance of free blacks.","By December 1862, Kentucky slaves were moving in such numbers that it became impossible to exercise control over them.  Brisbin related this occurrence: \"having become restless or dissatisfied, the slaves leave their homes, and setting their faces toward Louisville, journey for days over long miles to these headquarters, as the Mecca where freedom may be found....\"  By this time, it had become common for Kentucky slaves to ask for wages in return for their labor.  When denied, slaves often fled the plantation.  ","Over time, slaves had begun to make personal decisions without regard for the authority of the slaveholder.  Another popular movement of slaves was the enlistment of black men and boys into the army.  These enlisted slaves became freedmen, a circumstance that in itself weakened the institution of servitude in Kentucky.  Brisbin also noted that \"Negro enlistment has bankrupted slavery in Kentucky, over 22,000 of the most valuable slaves having gone into the service.\"  Indeed, by war's end, Kentucky had mustered 23,703 blacks into federal service.  ","The departure of slaves from Kentucky to the Northeast as wage earners, movement of blacks to towns and cities, and enlistment of the Kentucky slaves in military service all combined to create an acute labor shortage in Kentucky by 1865.  Indeed, Brisbin reasoned, \"Kentucky needs what black labor she has left to till the soil, and her slaves can now be of more service to the nation in the corn fields than in the army....\"  He concluded his letter by proposing that freeing the slaves in \"one blow\" would end the questionable status of labor in Kentucky.  Brisbin wrote, \"the sooner Kentucky makes up her mind and accepts the new order of things, and to establish labor upon a free, paid basis, the better it will be for her.\"","Though the formal emancipation of slaves in Kentucky did not take effect until the United States adopted the Thirteenth Amendment, it had ceased to be a \"viable institution\" long before then.  It had suffered such afflictions that left no hope for its reestablishment as it had existed before war.  Still, slavery had been more deeply entrenched in Kentucky than elsewhere in the border region.  At war's end, more than sixty-five thousand slaves remained in bondage, and it would take decades of further persistence for Kentucky to embrace racial equality."],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":4979,"lat":38.1872796075,"lng":-85.6593965884,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4038,"title":"The Racism of Reconstruction\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-04-01","end_date":"1877-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The period of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War saw a fluctuation of freedoms for African Americans in the former Confederate South.

As this happened, the \"violence had a profound effect on Reconstruction politics\" and produced a \"demoralizing impact upon [the African American] communities.\"  As the violence towards African Americans increased in the South, they became much less likely to not take the opportunity to vote or run in elections, which further destabilized the basic foundation of power that had just been established with the beginning of Reconstruction.

The economy of the South was still dependent on agriculture, however, as most of its land consisted of rural areas that needed to be farmed. Former slaves, now freedmen, were no longer bonded to harsh labor without benefits. Emancipation resulted in contracts between ex-masters and freedmen agreeing upon paid labor. In return for minimal pay and shelter, African Americans would work on land belonging to white landowners. On the land of George  C. Hannah in Charlotte County, Virginia, former slaves shared a similar experience.  On January 1, 1867, Hannah established a written agreement between himself and the freedmen he hired to work on his land. The agreement would last for the entire year until December 31, 1868, when another would be put into effect.

The nine different workers on Hannah's land, some of whom had families and were formerly slaves, were expected to \"bind themselves to work diligently and faithfully, obeying all orders.\" As long as the freedmen complied fully with every rule and regulation, Hannah would pay them in proportion to their work effort and in accordance with the number of family members each had. The payments ranged from a minimum seventy-two dollars per year, awarded to a single man named Cornelius, to one hundred and sixty dollars for a family of four.

Hannah, if any of the freedmen left their employment before the expiration of the year, or should he have had a \"cause to discharge any of them before such time for neglect of duty, violation of orders, or any improper conduct whatever,\" they would be expelled from their work and forced to forfeit one half of their earned wages for the year."],"display_date":"January 1, 1867 - December 1, 1870","search_date":"1868-12-16","locations":[{"id":13732,"lat":37.0115838339,"lng":-78.6616403562,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLOTTE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4060,"title":"An Extraordinary Slave Preacher\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1849 Rev. William White wrote a narrative about African American Preachers.

When he was forty he heard a Presbyterian Minister from Prince Edward County preach and became religious. White wrote  that once Jack found religion he wanted to learn to read so that he could study the bible. He convinced his master's children to teach him by \"promising to reward them for their pains with nuts and other fruits, as tuition fees.\" Once he learned to read, he received his license from the Baptist church and began to preach. In Nottoway at this time there were not many churches and Jack was \"often called to preach at a distance of more than thirty miles from his home.\" Additionally Jack \" secured the respect and confidence of the white people,\" as well as the adulation of blacks, and when his master died he was able to buy his freedom thanks to donations from white members of the community. ","Uncle Jack's experience as a black preacher was not typical. Many white southerners were hostile to black preachers after 1831 because of the slave rebellion lead by Nat Turner, a slave preacher, which was responsible for the death of 57 white men, women and children.  Slave owners passed laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read or write, and encouraged slaves to attend services given by white preachers who indoctrinated them with the idea that good, hardworking slaves who respected their masters would go to heaven. ","There are several reasons why Uncle Jack might have been exempt from these restrictions. The first is that he did not fit white stereotypes about slaves, especially in terms of his speech. White wrote, \"the reader must not be surprised, therefore, that nothing occurs in what we quote from his own lips, of the jargon peculiar to the African race. Nobody ever heard the good old preacher say massa for master or me for I.\" Another reason he may have been exempt from restrictions was that he rejected typical \"slave\" style preaching. In particular \"he uniformly opposed, both in public and private, every thing like noise and disorder in the house of God. His coloured auditors were very prone to err in this way. But whenever they did, he suspended the exercises until they became silent.\" Whatever the reasons, Uncle Jack achieved something extraordinary through his religion and lived a life unlike most other slaves because of it.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.

In the terms of the oath he swore to \"support and defend the Constitution\" and to support all laws including \"the emancipation of slaves\" from that time forward. By taking this oath, he secured amnesty for serving the Confederacy during the war, considered an act of treason. That day he received a slip of paper noting that he had taken the oath, but he returned six days later to request a letter from the Provost Marshall confirming his allegiance and giving him permission to purchase a pistol for his own protection. Almost a month later, on June 26, he returned yet again for a duplicate certificate of his Oath of Allegiance. Papers such as these restored J.H. Claiborne and other former Confederates to their status of citizens of the United States during Reconstruction, a time when a Confederate war record often excluded men from the political landscape they once ruled. Generals Lee and Grant determined the terms of the surrender at Appomattox, but this agreement did not begin to address many of the questions created by the end of the struggle. Politicians determined the terms of reunion during the era of Reconstruction.

Exempted from the proclamation were top ranking Confederates, as well as owners of more than 20,000 in property. These southerners who were not given amnesty in the proclamation would have to swallow their pride and appeal to the President Johnson for amnesty. Inevitably Johnson pardoned almost anyone who requested one, a much more lenient policy than the previously proposed Wade-Davis Bill of June 1864 that required men to swear that they had never aided the Confederacy in order to participate politically.

The possibility of an insurrection of the newly autonomous group of freedmen in their area terrified the white men of Matthews County. According to the 1860 and 1870 census, freedmen composed almost one half of the population in Matthews, and if united, they could pose a threat to white landowners. The <em>Norfolk Virginian</em> claimed that \"Negroes [were] ... buying arms wherever they [could] procure them\" and \"uttering serious threats.\" This spirit of revenge was thought to exist in freedmen throughout Virginia and the entire South. Conflicts between the freedmen and whites stemmed from the fact that freedmen did not want to be employed by whites under year-long contracts or other conditions similar to slavery.","White fears of \"Negro domination\" manifested themselves in various ways, such as the formation of a militia in Matthews County, Virginia. In other areas of the South white supremacy groups such as the KKK formed to violently force the black community into submission through violence. Eric Foner discusses the conflicts of implementing a free labor system in the South in his <em>Short History of Reconstruction. </em>Fears of a takeover by blacks existed long before they became freedmen. During slavery, plantation owners lived in constant fear of the possibility of a slave revolt. The Thirteenth Amendment freed the slaves and opened the door to a world of free labor in the southern states. With increasing autonomy in their labor decisions it was plausible that freedmen may seek some sort of revenge on their previous masters. In general, however, most slaves did not desire to seek violent restitution for their time in slavery. Although some freedmen demanded land rights from their masters as payment for their labor during slavery, most focused on reuniting their families, educating themselves, and establishing a black community.  Blacks disliked the year long contracts because they did not allow them to choose the crops they planted and they did not repay them fairly for their labor. Eventually sharecropping emerged as a new form of tenancy that was touted as beneficial to both whites and blacks, and the contract system faded away."],"display_date":"December 4, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-04","locations":[{"id":14039,"lat":37.3887731419,"lng":-76.252448521,"zoom":10,"place":"MATHEWS, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4088,"title":"Exiled From Florida\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-01-01","end_date":"1845-01-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Florida was originally settled by Spaniards, in 1558.

The numbers of exiled slaves became so great in 1736, they were acknowledged by the Floridians, being referred to as Maroons, and also became allies in defending the territory.  Georgia was formed as a free colony between South Carolina and Florida and used as buffer colony to protect the Carolina planters' slave interests.  However, in 1750, a Creek Indian Chief named Seacoffee left the tribe with a large group of followers.  They traveled from Alabama to Florida, and under the Spanish colonial policy, they were incorporated into the Spanish population and entitled to land in the territory of Florida.  They settled near the area of the Exiles and refused all Creek laws.  These exiles were called \"Seminoles\" by the Creek Indians, meaning \"runaways.\"  They elected their own chiefs and became their own tribe.  Some members intermarried with members from the Maroons, as the groups merged into one entity.

Meanwhile, Andrew Jackson urged that the Exiles in Florida were a threat to the security of America's boarders, especially since receiving weapons and a fort from the British.  Jackson wrote a letter to President Monroe explaining the need for annexing Florida in order to emigrate the Indians west of Arkansas.

In July, 1875, the newspaper lamented the lack of economic development in the form of manufacturing over the previous years in the surrounding area.  Southerners in all parts of the former Confederacy were aware that the lack of manufacturing capability outside of the state of Virginia had given the North too great of an advantage during the war.  Without citing any specific examples, the paper stated that very little had changed about the local economy in the past decade.  ","Besides the obvious lack of slave labor, Natchez and surrounding environs remained largely agricultural, with no significant manufacturing sector to speak of.  An examination of both the 1870 and 1880 United States census data (which measured the amount of capital invested in manufacturing in dollars) supports the newspaper's claim.  In 1870, there was 4,501,714 invested in manufacturing in Mississippi.  Ten years later, this figure had only grown to 4,727,600, an increase of merely 225,886.  This amounts to an increase of approximately five percent over the 1870 level in the following decade, which is far behind usual growth patterns.  This lack of manufacturing growth means that very few new jobs were created.  The livelihoods of former slaves and poor whites were still largely based in agriculture, but they very rarely owned their own land and instead contributed to the vast increase in the practice of sharecropping.  Natchez was far from unusual in the South.  By 1880, the Southern states accounted for roughly the same percentage of industrial development nationwide as they had before the war.

According to the <em>New York Evangelist</em>, \"seeing the upper or southern extremity of the village, and probably misunderstanding its extent, he ordered Reno to ford the river, and charge the villagers with three companies, while he, with five companies, moved down the right bank and behind the bluff, to make a similar attack at the other end.\" Reno did as he was told, but soon retreated to the limited cover of the timberline after about 20 minutes of fighting. Custer had told Reno that he would stay near enough to provide Reno's forces with reinforcements, if needed. However, Custer took a diverging route and stumbled upon the village, which was ready to fight. The Native American forces engaged Custer's troops, which were pushed back from the river, through a valley, and onto a high ridge. There, all of Custer's battalion were surrounded and, save for Custer's Crow scout, \"were annihilated by hostile Sioux savages,\" as described in the <em>Prairie Farmer</em>. Fighting continued the remainder of the day and the next, with Reno's forces withstanding Native American attacks until being relieved by generals Terry and Gibbon on the third day, just after the enemy had fled.","According to historian Walter Camp, the battle \"was no massacre; there was no ambush, no trap set for the white troops to enter. It was a battle in three fights, fair and simple. The Indians had met Custer's detachments in detail and defeated them, all within sight of their village.\" Although Custer was widely criticized at the time, the ambiguity surrounding his death gave artists free reign to interpret his final moments. One of the most popular images created by artists since is of \"Custer's Last Stand,\" which most often portrays Custer as a fearless, buckskin-clad man standing firm and stalwart in a swarm of Indians and fallen soldiers, defying death itself. Historian Brian W. Dippie claims, artists \"gave it instantly recognizable form and planted it in our heads.\" Additionally, Custer's widow, Elizabeth, actively campaigned to establish her husband's legacy as a valiant and brazen hero - an effort that was widely successful. ","To whites, the myth of Custer's Last Stand could be interpreted as \"white civilization surrounded, indeed stormed, by white savagery,\" as Dippie suggests. The Prairie Farmer betrays the white majority's opinions of Native Americans as \"hostile savages\" and \"red devils.\" This one-dimensional myth is how the Battle of Little Bighorn was viewed for more than a century. However, in the late twentieth century, efforts were made to explore the Native American outlook on what they termed the Battle of the Greasy Grass. Little Bighorn came at the apex of the United States Government's attempts to subjugate Native Americans by forcing them onto reservations. As suggested by Native American scholar Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., whites \"offered the Indians the same three choices: become whites; stay on reservations, isolated from the rest of us, until you can be assimilated; or resist both choices and die.\" Douglas C. McChristian reiterates this point: \"They knew it as...a great, yet fleeting victory that signaled the doom of their traditional way of life.\" To some, the controversial battle was a symbol of American virtue. Yet to others, the battle reflected the conflict between unending American westward expansion and the Native American defense of their land and way of life. To bridge the gap, many scholars have attempted a more universal reinterpretation of the Battle of Little Bighorn that encompasses both the long-held view of the former and the more recent emergence of the latter."],"display_date":"July 15, 1876","search_date":"1876-07-15","locations":[{"id":8042,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"BIG HORN, Montana"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4128,"title":"Ambush of Round Mountain\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-19","end_date":"1861-11-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many Indians disagreed to Secession, but not necessarily agree to abolition, either.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4229,"title":"Charles William Truehearts Account of the Battle of the Crater:  Reconsidering Black and White\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-08-28","end_date":"1864-08-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            When the Civil War broke out, Texan Charles William Trueheart was at the University of Virginia studying medicine.  Despite initial reservations about secession, he joined the multitudes of southerners who rushed to enlist.  At first an artilleryman, by 1864 Trueheart had finished studying medicine and was an assistant surgeon in the 8th Alabama Infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was in this capacity that he experienced the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864 in Petersburg, Virginia.","            As Charles W. Trueheart recalled in an August 28, 1864 letter to his brother, Henry Trueheart, the level of death and destruction at the Crater was horrific.  He tells his brother, \"I have never any where seen such a slaughter as there was enacted,\" the dead and wounded were spread across several acres and, \"in many places you couldn't walk without stepping on their carcasses lying one two or even three deep.\"  The \"Crater\" was the result of an attempt by Union forces under Ambrose Burnside to smash the Confederacy's heavily fortified position at Petersburg by tunneling under their location and setting off a major explosion.  To this end, the Union effort was a success, but in the ensuing struggle, the Union attack lacked coordination and became log jammed at the Crater.  The Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee quickly capitalized on this error and inflicted a severe defeat on Burnside's forces, notably including the 4th Division of the United States Colored Troops.  For most Confederates at the Crater, this was their first encounter with black soldiers, here represented in major proportions.","            The black soldiers' presence was Charles Trueheart's main focus in recounting the aftermath of the battle.  His first mention was of the \"Negroes\" that lay dead and wounded with the \"Yankees[,] those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  Throughout the letter, Trueheart looked at the relationship of these two entities. He said that the injured blacks \"bore their sufferings much better than the Yankees;\" that they complained less and displayed greater Christian devotion in their sufferings.  Moreover, Trueheart wrote that the main complaints that the blacks had were that the Yankees abused them and that the slaves among them wanted to return to their masters.  Trueheart then described the heroism and ability of the blacks, almost equal to the Confederates' and far surpassing the behavior of the white Yankees.  He noted an instance wherein, \"one black fellow...had a regular duel with the Sergeant Major of our reg't.\"  Trueheart says that they traded several shots, that the black soldier, in fact, landed the first shot, hitting \"the Sgt. in the forehead.  Fortunately his head was as thick as his heart was brave, and the ball glanced upwards.\"  A Confederate at last shot and killed the black soldier.  In another notable encounter, an \"officer in our Brigade, having captured a negro in the trenches, told him to turn and fire upon the retreating Yankees; which he did rapidly.\"","            It is impossible to determine how much of Trueheart's account was true, but certainly there is a pervasive slant.  Indeed, many others reported with sadistic pleasure the widespread massacre of black troops by soldiers encouraged to execute them rather than take any prisoner.  The purpose of Truehearts' revisions seems almost inherent within the letter.  It reflected an interest, at the very least, in a temporary realignment of social inclusiveness that would incorporate blacks (40% of the Southern population) and thus engender support for the war efforts against \"those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  The value of blacks to the war effort was undeniable; loyalty of slaves on the plantations was a major issue, but their presence on the battlefield could be even more potent.  Around 200,000 black soldiers served in the Union, almost 25% of the number of men thought to have fought for the Confederacy-an especially impressive figure considering the comparatively small proportion of blacks in the Union, as well as their exclusion from enlistment until more than two years after the war began.  ","            By the Battle of the Crater in 1864, confidence in the ultimate success of the Confederacy was waning and there was considerable agitation for inclusion of blacks in the war effort.  Significantly, most supporters of a black soldiery also espoused emancipation, which they saw as an unfortunate but necessary accomplice.  By 1865, even top Confederate officials like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee came out in support of the plan. Yet the time had passed for such a move.  With the Confederate States' defeat in spring of 1865, it became a moot point.  The fragile wartime overture of Southern whites was rendered little more than a moment's retreat from racist agendas that defined much of the South's history."],"display_date":"August 28, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-28","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4258,"title":"An Early Condemnation of &#39;Legal&#39; Disenfranchisement\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-02-07","end_date":"1880-02-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February7, 1880 the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article condemning educational tests for voting registration in the South which an editorial in the Charleston <em>News</em> had proposed as a way of suppressing the black vote. The article explains that the reasoning behind the author in the <em>News</em> editorial was that the \"'more intelligent and reasonable citizens must rule'\" no matter whether they are the majority or not and that suppressing the Negro vote was the only way to ensure this. The problem the <em>News</em> editorial author saw was that the current method of violence and intimidation seemed to violate the law and went against the sentiments of many people both in the state of South Carolina and outside it. Moreover, the current method was inconsistent in its effects, whereas an indoctrinated system would be much more systematized and effective. ","The concepts expressed in the News article were a precursor to future action by southern states. In 1890 Mississippi enacted laws such as literacy tests as a method of \"legal\" disenfranchisement, and as the <em>News</em> article predicted these laws worked amazingly well. They were so effective, in fact, that by 1900 all but four southern states had enacted some form of literacy tests and in those states that had them the black vote was all but extinct. The reason these literacy tests worked so well on the black population was that most slaves had never been taught to read or write and only some progress had been made in educating them after Emancipation. ","The successful imposition of these literacy tests was due in part to the fact that there was wide support for them across the country. The author of the New York Times article, in fact, voiced his support for literacy tests as \"a simple and natural method by which a community can protect itself against serious abuse and dangers.\" The problem the author saw was that these laws would not be administered equally or impartially and were simply a tool for suppressing the black vote. Under this premise \"an educational test becomes merely an instrumentality of wrong and fraud\" and so cannot be tolerated because it interferes with the democratic process. ","One must conclude in reading this article that Northern politicians were well aware of Southern intentions to disenfranchise blacks using legal tools long before they were ever able to enact them. The question is why did they let them? Part of the reason lies in the fact that the Democratic Party returned to national dominance in the mid 1880s and undid much of the Reconstruction legislation meant to ensure black rights. But Richard Valelly in his book <em>The Two Reconstructions</em> argues that it was also the fact that the Republican Party lost interest in the black community as a political group. As he states, \"The enormous and rapid growth of the Republican Party in the late 1890s outside the South substituted for lost black voters at the margin.\" So despite the fact that Republicans in the North knew that Southerners sought legal means to disenfranchise blacks they lacked the legal power and political interest to do anything about it."],"display_date":"February 7, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-07","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4260,"title":"Separation of Church and Race\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-07-01","end_date":"1866-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout 1866, the First Baptist Church in Charleston, South Carolina was rapidly losing its membership.  However, on July 1, 1866, something extraordinarily important happened: several black men applied for a blanket \"letter of dismission\" to cover every \"colored member.\"  Prior to this date, the church officers had been unconcerned because the only requests had been from white members, but black men and women liberated by the Civil War were eager to form separate congregations for the first time, and this was the cause of some concern.  ","The First Baptist  Church record indicates that a committee was formed to decide whether or not to allow the division, ultimately recommending letters to those \"whose standing [was] unquestioned.\"  The committee refused to grant a blanket letter because some blacks wanted to retain their First Baptist membership.  While the church seemed hesitant in permitting separation, it was \"glad\" to sustain black membership.  Those who stayed were guaranteed all privileges enjoyed before.  But these probably included stringent limitations as there was no further movement toward racial equality.","Following the Civil War, race relations within the church were thrown into confusion.  Southern white preachers taught in a process called \"theological racism\" that God supported divisions and inequalities between the races.  At first, white Southerners believed that the situation would remain much the same: white leaders with segregated black sections.  But as evidenced by the First  Baptist Church records, many black people wanted complete separation.  Generally once religious segregation began, white Southern churches resisted the reintegration hoped for by Northern brethren, and black Southerners wanted to retain their new independence, even though they understood its limitations.  Blacks and whites found very little common ground and eventually wanted nothing more than complete separation.  Among various Southern Protestant denominations, the Baptist church was one of the most accessible.  Its independent and localized structure easily supported the organization of new black churches.","In 1866, the First Baptist Church of Charleston, S.C. was in transition, simultaneously supporting segregation and peaceful coexistence.

The Civil War had not put an end to racial conflicts, especially in the South.

It was determined that the general cause of the riots was racial tension between blacks and poor whites-- particularly between poor whites and blacks who had served in the Union army. More importantly, \"There was an especial hatred among the city police for the Colored Soldiers, who were stationed here for a long time and had recently been discharged.\" The city police were at the core of much of the rioting, often leading the mobs.","    The rioting began during a confrontation between policemen and black veterans.

Immediately following this action a group of 18 white men entered John Carter's Grocery.

This trapped the black men and the white group charged firing into the huddled assemblage of men.","            The attack killed Orange Rhodes, Calvin Carter was supposedly killed, and a few other men were injured some severely and others slightly; in fact the report also accounts for Calvin Carter as slightly injured. Taken into custody, the white men were placed under bonds of 1500 while awaiting their appearance before a criminal court. Michael Walsh concluded that these eighteen White men had been prepared for this action.

There were only thirty-two black residents of Greenville who were recorded as free. By 1840, the census records a twenty percent increase in slaves and an estimate of forty-three freed persons in Greenville, S.C. Looking at the South Carolina deeds of sell for 1820 to 1850 there is an indication that the circulation of slaves was very high. Several slaves who had a trade as a blacksmith, painter, mariner, or other essential profession were sold sometimes as often as twice a year. Slave women were also sold at this rate if they were accomplished cooks or seamstresses. Greenville County's slave holders would rotate these professionals based on demand throughout the region. Usually slaves were only mentioned in the sale by their first name. At this revolving rate, slaves coming through Greenville or the vagueness of the actual records of sold slaves makes it difficult to distinguish if Easter Hudson was a slave owned by a member of the Hudson family or a freed black in 1835.

This leads the question; did Easter Hudson participate in the Baptist Church as a slave? Was she forced to attend, because of her owner's wishes or did she attend on her own free will without the confines of her social situation? "," Brushy Creek Baptist Church recognized slaves as members of the church since its establishment in August 1805. The practice of white Southerners bringing their slaves to church was a very common one. The gallery in a church was especially designed to separate the races in a church. Evangelization was extremely important for southerners to rationalize slavery as an institution based on the paternalistic duties of \"civilizing\" the slave. Slave evangelization was promoted by slave owners, because the ministry of Christianity might, \"encouraged slaves to be more obedient and less prone to rebel against circumstances.\" ","Easter's mere existence in the church minutes is an example of the involvement of black members in a religious organization during the early nineteenth century. The status of black church members is redefined by the emancipation of slaves, especially during the Reconstruction period of the South. Religious racism continued throughout the Reconstruction period and well into the Gilded Age as these individuals struggled with participation and clergy rights in white churches.

Heard had been involved in a similar incident over a year before which had resulted in a successful suit against the company. The Constitution relates that he decided to bring additional suit against the Georgia Railroad Company in order to obtain further confirmation of the Interstate Commerce Commissioners' opposition to such practices by the railroad companies. The Georgia Railroad Company quickly objected to the suit based on \"various grounds\" including the \"jurisdiction of the courts,\" said the Constitution. The company quickly responded to Heard's petition by saying that the cars for the \"colored passengers [were] equally as safe, comfortable, and clean...as those provided for the whites.\" The suit was postponed for a significant period and eventually halted at a stalemate. However Heard had done his part in the fight against segregation of railroad cars. ","Heard was not the only sufferer who decided to fight back. Another suit was filed to the Interstate Commerce Commission by a man name William H. Councill. According to the May 31 Constitution, Councill was seeking 25,000 worth of damages for being \"forcibly ejected from a first-class car after having paid for a first class ticket.\" He was subsequently subjected to riding in the \"Jim Crow\" car. The trend had been set, and the Georgia Railroad Company soon found itself mired down with court cases. The ranks against the Georgia Railroad Company and railroad segregation began to swell even more with the key addition of Rev. George C. Rowe of Charleston. The Constitution describes how Rev. Rowe began a nationwide campaign after he and several other colored passengers were forced to ride in the \"Jim Crow\" car after purchasing first-class tickets. The purpose of Rowe's campaign was to rally support, both moral and financial, with which to bring suit against the Georgia Railroad Company and against racial segregation in general. While the efforts of men such as Heard, Councill, and Rowe may have fallen short in achieving racial equality, their fortitude certainly helped establish precedence for the long and difficult fight against inequality."],"display_date":"1887 - 1889","search_date":"1888-07-01","locations":[{"id":2193,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4288,"title":"Navy Slams Army: The Beginning of a Rivalry\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-11-29","end_date":"1890-11-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Cadet Walker of the Army football team races down the sideline in pursuit of the Naval  Academy's captain Emerich.  Walker finally catches his opponent, and leaps at his chest to try and bring him down.  In the fall, Walker's chest is crushed by the Midshipman, and he is unable to rise.  His comrades race to his side and pump his lungs until he regains consciousness, and the cadet eventually stands to his feet and continues to play.  ","This scene unfolded at the first athletic competition, a football game, between the United  States Military Academy and the United  States Naval Academy in West   Point, New York.  In the course of the game, Cadet Walker was knocked senseless an amazing four different times.  He never gave up, however, and as the New York Times reported, \"He was knocked out four times, and yet he fought as long as consciousness lasted.\"  When the final gun sounded, the visiting Midshipmen were declared the winners by a score of 32 -0.  ","The game was the beginning of a century-long rivalry that has seen numerous close games and great competition between the nation's premier military academies.  Not only did the game serve as a source of entertainment for the cadets and midshipmen of the two academies, it also served a greater national purpose.  According to Steven W. Pope, these soldier-athletes that were created in the first football game served as an inspiration to young men across the United States, giving them something to pull for and aspire to.    ","After the Spanish - American War, the Navy instituted a policy that focused on the health of its crews, and this goal was accomplished mainly through athletics.  Athletics became a central part of academy life, as the platform of sports provided the soldiers with excellent relief from the monotony of structured military life, and served to instill the values of hard work and physical fitness in soldiers as well.  In addition to creating a better trained and more focused soldier, sports, and especially rivalries such as this one, gave the country a sense of nationalism.  Athletic events, particularly those between the country's soldiers, served to repair class divisions, restore social order, and create a sense of patriotism throughout the United States, uniting a country torn apart by suffering and war.

Nat grew up very religious, and had the ability to read and write. Along with his education, his spirituality gave him a distinct view of the injustices of slavery taking place around him. Turner believed that he could lead a successful revolt, and in February of 1831 he executed his plan. Turner's original plan was to commence the insurrection on July fourth, but his plans abruptly changed due to a lunar eclipse on the 12th of February. \"On the appearance of the sign, I should arise and prepare myself, and slay my enemies with their own weapons.\"  The eclipse was viewed by Turner to be a sign from god telling him to start the rebellion. Nat Turner, accompanied by a few trusted fellow slaves entered their master's house killing the entire family. Their acts were brutal and merciless.  Recollecting the murders, Nat said, \"Will immediately killed Mrs. Turner, with one blow of his axe. I took Mrs. Newsome by the hand, and with the sword I had when I was apprehended, I struck her several blows over the head, but not being able to kill her, as the sword was dull, Will turned around, and discovering it, dispatched her also.\" Turner's rebel force, which amounted to about fifty strong, continued going house to house until White militia ended the insurrection. On the fifth of November Nat underwent a trial.  He was sentenced to death and later hung. Thomas Ruffin Grey was Turner's lawyer, and he published \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\" as a result of his time spent with Turner when he was in jail. ","    In the antebellum South slave rebellions and conspiracies tended to be extinguished, slaves still continued to resist. Nat Turner's rebellion along with many others raised a continuous concern of safety to the whites living in Virginia. Demographically, the slave population in Virginia was continuously growing, with large concentrations of slaves all over the state. Many whites feared that soon African-Americans would outnumber White slaveholders, making it difficult to keep surveillance over such a large population that could easily communicate. Economically, the plantation economy was deteriorating giving rise to more towns and cities. With the growth of towns and cities, economic gain was found in skilled artisanship, leading to the education of slaves in order for them to conduct such activity. Abolitionist pressure from the north also influenced the African-American community through propaganda and preaching by people sympathetic to emancipation. These factors brewed together produced a slave who was educated, in touch with other slaves, and fueled by the ideas of emancipation.

The main characters Fannie North and Nancy South had extremely different views but the one characteristic they shared was their desire for change. The external image of two girls represented the divisive issue of slavery opinions in the north. Fannie North lived in a small cottage and longed for \"a larger and freer home\" in which to grow and be independent. Nancy South had plenty of room and the finest of all material goods, but she was always seeking more. Nancy was not content with her blessings and fortunes. Rather she chose to conquer land and impose her force on others. While \"quiet little Fannie North was [...] contenting herself faithfully living in her narrow sphere, till God should see fit to grant her more room, big Nancy South spread out broader than ever,\"  the desire for more room in which to expand herself only contributed to her selfishness. Fannie was saddened by her lack of freedom and wanted nothing more than to help herself and others enjoy free will. Her counterpart was unsympathetic and self-interested, wanting only what benefited her. The story ended with reassurance that \"Nancy's mansion is large and high, but on a sandy foundation\", her power was diminishing day by day. ","Opinions ran rampant during the Civil War which began in April of the publication year. Many northerners felt strongly that slavery was immoral and must be condemned. The portrayal of southerners as guided by financial and material gains rather than values began appearing in literature and propaganda. Carl Osthaus commented on southern deviance by saying they were all \"shiftlessness and exploitation was the rule to follow\". He believed this was why they failed to see the human side of slavery.

According to historian Warren Sollors, in 1727 a white woman abandoned her husband because she fell in love with a black man. As a result, laws in 1741 called attention to the interracial marriage of whites and blacks in America. A fine of fifty pounds was to be paid in addition to children of these marriages to work on plantations for an additional two years term. This provoked the notion of legally integrating two races into one another's world. Abolitionists published literature and essays in support of cultural mixing between blacks and whites, creating a unified community. H. Dexter's <em>Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, applied to the American White Man and Negro,</em> is documentation of the positive theories and cultural improvements that interlacing the two races would fabricate in America. ","Dexter stated what he felt would make America a perfected race when he claimed, \"All that is needed to make us the finest race on Earth is to engraft upon our stock the Negro element which providence has placed by our side on this continent.\" The concept of creating a powerful combination of both black and white Americans resulted from two abolitionists and psychologists, Dr. Pritchard and Don Felix DeAzara, wrote essays in response to the \"evil of the pure and the benefit of the mixed.\" These scholars relying on scientific racism wrote about color of the skin depending on the temperature and climate conditions in which they were raised. They concluded that color of skin was irrelevant to the content of their hearts. As an example, the pale English would remain white in the rainy climate of England, while the Africans dark with the climate of the hot, humid sun would need their shadowed complexion. The color of one's skin is only<em> </em>a result of one's environment, nothing more. If integration were introduced, soon humans would have red, blond, and brown hair with some straight or curly. Secondly, the vital thing to remember, despite diversity in appearance, the anatomy is all the same. The human race stems from the same Adam.","Despite Sollors's opinion of the advantages of interracial societies being too difficult to pinpoint due to deep-seated prejudices, Prichard managed to do so very boldly and effectively. He declared that states intermixing races creates a very strong, vital series of new cultural advantages both physically and in the workforce. Black intermixing into American society was the starting line in black history, which led them into the \"white limited\" business world. Due to Prichard's positive concepts of black integration, Minchin's novel of the black textile worker discussed the initial occurrences of whites and black intermingling on the job. In addition, Prichard's companion, Don Felix DeAzara, added to the notion of interracial advantages in America. He claimed America's citizens would posses beautiful features and an agreeable personality, which would carry with them in the work force and throughout life. The idea of merging two cultures would give each race particular characteristics of one another. Combining cultures would produce a race of vigorous life on top of stellar physical conditions surpassing previous generations of American society.  ","            Americans learned from watching the Dutch and French interlock with one another, as did they with ancient tales of the Egyptians, that integration of culture could create a powerful result. Taking two commanding races and combining them creates new advantageous in the work force, and in personal development. Such interrelations inscribe new traits and encourage one to \"love our opposites.\" A concerned southerner one asked of integration, \"What will you do with the negro when he is free?\" A proud response foreshadowing the promise of a great nation and the results of integration responded, \"We will take him into our societies, into our churches, into our schools, into our social circles, into our families; we will receive him as our younger brother.\""],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4348,"title":"Pauline Cushman Gains Trust of the Rebels: An Episode from Her Life\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Pauline Cushman was born Harriet Wood in the South, on June 10, 1833. Living the beginning of her life in New Orleans, she eventually moved with her family to northern Michigan where she first discovered her love of the theatre. By the age of eighteen she moved to New York to try her luck at being an actress and stage performer. In homage to Charlotte Cushman, her favorite performer, Harriet legally changed her name to Pauline Cushman. She later married Charles Dickinson, who was called away to fight for the Union in 1862. ","Cushman joined a theater company three months after her  husband left, that toured all across the South, spreading her name throughout the area. One evening after a performance in \"Union-controlled Louisville, Kentucky,\" Cushman was given a large sum of money to toast to Jefferson Davis. She complied, despite her love of the Union, and toasted her enemy. Cushman's theatre company, enraged with her trading allegiance for cash, fired her. Cushman was not phased, as she used her toasting opportunity to \"rub elbows\" with the Rebels. By doing so, she managed to gain their trust as a map and document transporter for the South, while secretly serving as a Union spy. ","According to the <em>Detroit Tribune</em> article <em>Miss Maj. Pauline Cushman, The Federal Scout and Spy</em> in May of 1864, Cushman's accomplishments were praised through journalist accounts of her dramatic escapes. Cushman was captured three separate times, two of which she managed to escape from. Of the second, Cushman was en route to Nashville, riding on the Hardin Pike, when two Confederate scouts grew suspicious of her and mounted her on horseback to bring back for sentencing. Quick on her feet, Cushman paid a slave ten dollars to invent a story of Union soldiers attacking to distract the Confederate scouts. When the scouts fled to check out the invading troops, Cushman escaped temporarily, only to be recaptured the following day. Her eventual capture while concealing Southern battle plans in her shoes and petticoats placed her in jail. By now, the sickly Cushman was sentenced to hanging upon notice of her recovery. Had it not been for the Union invading the Confederate town three days prior to her scheduled execution, Cushman might never have survived to pass along her stories. ","Upon her release, Cushman returned to New York to visit friends and family and to lecture those interested in her adventures.

This conflict, however, arose between the Executive and Legislative branches. It is quite possible that only a man of Lincoln's strength could have succeeded in handling the Reconstruction crisis that led to the feud, and Johnson, his successor, was unfortunately not of the same cut. As will be seen, given the nature of the crisis, few people would. ","Generally speaking, Reconstruction is divided into several phases, with the distinction between two of them being Presidential and Congressional Reconstruction, both of which are self-explanatory regarding who was in charge. When Lincoln, the helmsman of the former phase, was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, took it upon himself to follow through with Lincoln's plan for an amicable and (especially) rapid restoration of the Union. Unfortunately for Johnson, the so-called \"Radical Republicans\" that controlled Congress at the time abhorred the Southern States' passage of Black Codes and attempted to slow their reentry into the Union as punishment. Johnson, of course, still had speed as his priority and refused to back these punitive measures. When Congress realized they would get no help from Johnson, they decided to take matters into their own hands and proposed the Freedman's Bureau Bill in late 1865. The Bureau itself had been a temporary entity founded by Lincoln immediately after the war with the intention of assisting the newly freed slaves. Under the Bill proposed by Congress, however, the Bureau's longevity and powers would be greatly increased. While this was ostensibly to give more and better aid to the slaves, it was by no means coincidental that the Bill's passage would transfer <em>de facto</em> control of Reconstruction from Johnson to Congress.  ","From Johnson's point of view, this was a dilemma in the fullest sense of the word: oppose the bill and gain enemies or allow it and lose power. He chose the former and vetoed the passage of the Bill in February of 1866. According to <u>The New York Times</u>, Johnson gave several reasons for this, although the largest one seemed to be that passage of the Bill did not put enough faith in the abilities of the Southern leaders to handle Reconstruction on their own. Furthermore, the article states that Johnson claimed to believe \"that the question of the Union is paramount to all others.\" Taken together, these statements reflect an attempt by Johnson to rally the nation behind him more than anything else. Specifically, in the latter statement he seems to be likening himself to Lincoln and trying to take advantage of the late Lincoln's popularity in the North, with the former statement obviously being an attempt to put him on the good side of the Southern leaders. In the end, this would not help him, as Congress passed the Bill over his veto and basically used their new powers to make life miserable for Johnson, who would go on to have the dubious honor of being the first US President to be impeached.  ","In Johnson's defense, it cannot be denied that Lincoln, a popular man-of-the-people even before he was martyred, would have been a tough act to follow.  In that regard, it is not surprising that Johnson would remain so adamant on his quest to follow through with Lincoln's plan, as to change said plan would have seemed disrespectful to Lincoln's memory and therefore political suicide. The true irony of the situation becomes apparent here, as it was not changing the plan that would turn out to be the real suicide. Specifically, Johnson's unwillingness to deviate from Lincoln's hope for a fast rebuilding-even in the face of the Black Codes-led to Congress trying to seize Reconstruction authority via the Freedman's Bureau Bill, which in turn led to the lose-lose position that Johnson occupied in February 1866."],"display_date":"February 20, 1866","search_date":"1866-02-20","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4357,"title":"Passage of Shermans Special Orders No. 15\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-16","end_date":"1865-01-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although many regard war as good for absolutely nothing, the truth of the matter is that troops are not the only things that advance in war. In fact, some of the greatest advancements made by mankind in fields ranging from medicine to the arts can trace their roots to military necessity. One such example made in the field of Civil Rights during the American Civil War was Special Field Orders Number 15, popularly referred to as \"Forty Acres and a Mule.\" Issued by General William T. Sherman shortly after the end of his infamous March to the Sea, the act placed captured Southern land in the hands of the freed slaves, something that had never been done before. ","The fall of the seaport city of Savannah, Georgia in late 1844 to Union General William T. Sherman brought an end to the general's famous \"March to the Sea.\" Over a period of two months, a fifty-mile wide front of Union soldiers had marched up to 12 miles a day, looting what they wanted and destroying everything else, including the metaphorical chains of untold numbers of slaves. Under the Emancipation Proclamation, all slaves in areas controlled by the Union were granted freedom, which would pose an unforeseen problem in this case. Specifically, Abraham Lincoln had drafted the Proclamation at the North's nadir, when obtaining half as much land and slaves in twice the amount of time as Sherman had just done would have seemed impossible. As such, the Proclamation's wording about what to do with freed slaves was much too vague. Thus, having no way to support themselves, many of the new freedmen attached themselves to Sherman's army.","On January 16th, 1865, Sherman, with the blessing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, attempted to solve this problem with the passage of Special Field Orders No. 15. With the powers granted to him by the War, Sherman confiscated over thirty miles worth of plantations and islands from slaveholders and, taking a page from the 1862 Homestead Act, turned them over to the slaves for use as free settlements. It is interesting to note that while Order 15 is very explicit on such major rules and regulations as the maximum amount of land a single family could own (40 acres), it is remarkably silent on things that deal more with the day-to-day events of the settlement. To be sure, this would be in keeping with the Order's restriction of government interference with the settlement to protection and aid in setting up said settlement.","  Despite this, the Order itself unmistakably struck more of a blow against the CSA military and strategy than for Civil Rights. For starters, although the Order explicitly prohibited conscripting troops from the new settlements, it was no less explicit when it stated that all \"young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist.\" Additionally, the Order effectively turned a great mass of dead weight on Sherman's army into something of an occupation force. In this case, one that would produce rather than just occupy or be refugees and free up veteran soldiers for the coming months of war. On a final note, it is interesting to point out that Section III of the Order contains a line that could be interpreted as preparing for Reconstruction. Specifically, the Order states that Congress has the power to \"regulate\" the titles of the freedmen, effectively laying the ground for a transfer of power when the martial law that created the settlements was rendered null. The legal ramifications of transferring power from military to civilian hands are more complex than many realize, and in giving Congress some authority, Sherman no doubt eased this transfer. Unfortunately, the old maxim that laws are silent in times of war is a door that works both ways, in that the noticed laws of war may be silent in times of peace. In this case, during Reconstruction, much of Sherman's Land Grant properties reverted back to their Antebellum title holders.

Colonization, as the name implies, had the goal of colonizing slaves in Africa in a country called Liberia. As such, there were numerous attempts to convince Africans to willingly emigrate. One pamphlet seeking to do this was entitled \"Address to Free People of Color of the State of Maryland,\" as printed by John D. Toy in 1859. Toy opened by providing a brief summary of his life, saying that he had spent many years traveling, often in the company of Africans, who had shown him much kindness. Following this, he informed his audience of all the political and social rights that they will never gain if they stay in the United States, and tells them they have two options: continue on like this pointlessly, or flee the country. ","After that had been established, the pamphlet starts to sound like the sales pitch it is with the declaration \"Go to Liberia,\" for only there would the black race be free. To be sure, this passage is one of the few unexaggerated claims in the entire pamphlet. The assumption by Toy that race prejudice would hamper the lives of free blacks in the future was well-founded One can see evidence of the kind of racial pseudo-science that had given the European powers the pretext to colonize Liberia in the first place.  Toy reminds his readers that there are three basic kinds of climates in the world, with the black race being best suited for the tropics, in which Liberia is located. Elaborating on this, he describes Liberia as a land of perpetual perfect summer days. Specifically, he says that even though it seldom rains, there is an abundance of green vegetation under a sun that is \"not too hot.\" ","As would be expected of any sales pitch, this pamphlet exaggerates. All in all, Toy makes Liberia sound like Eden itself, down to an abundance of trees with valuable lumber. As for water, there are apparently so many good rivers that \"no one ever suffers even inconvenience from want of good water in Liberia.\" Regarding crops, Toy says that lima beans grow so well in Liberia that little work yields a good harvest and there is so much palm oil that in a few years Liberia will make more money off palm oil than Maryland makes off tobacco. Even today Liberia is \"richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture.\"","As for government, the author states that the government of Liberia has been recognized by many of the Great Powers, with whom they share good trading relations. He also says (as our Founders would put it) that the Liberian government is run by Africans, for Africans. Later on, he states that this will forever be the case because of \"African Fever,\" a malady deadly to whites that blacks are naturally immune to (again showing use of racial pseudo-sciences). Prior to this, however, he tells his readers that the government of Maryland will gladly pay for their passage across the Atlantic. Here we can see just how desperate even the Northern public was to get rid of the Africans. After all, few governments of any era are willing to pay for anything (especially anything expensive) when there is little profit expected in return. Of course, this claim may be another one of the actual truths in this pamphlet.

In his speech, Everett discussed the reasons for the ACS, such as stopping the slave trade, and discusses their inspirations which include the spread of Christianity and American ideals.","Historian Irving H. Bartlett regarded Everett as \"conventional among Americans outside of the South\" in his views on slavery.  He knew that slavery was an \"unfortunate institution,\" but that it was protected by the Constitution.  This made Everett a relatively neutral party in assessing the accomplishments of the ACS.  Everett showed that the ACS had succeeded in its original goal which was to stop the slave trade.  He said that many other civilizations had attempted to stop the trade, but the ACS had actually done it by giving slaves that were on captured slave ships a place to settle and possibly assist them in finding their original homes. ","He later talked about the many reasons civilizing Africa had been a failure and why the ACS would correct this failure with their plans.  Everett believed that the white man could not civilize Africa because disease and cultural and environmental differences in Africa would not allow it. He went on to say that with all of the natural endowments of Africa, it had to be civilized because it was a waste of such a fertile continent. The argument of many of the critics of the ACS was that Africans were too inferior to Europeans to be civilized.  Everett said that this was not entirely true, and cited the example of the Egyptians and of many intelligent Africans who had been given appropriate education. Everett argued that if the lower classes of white men were compared with the African race then the superiority of whites may not be so apparent.  He compared the accomplishments in Liberia by the colony set up by the ACS to that of the first colonies in America such as Jamestown and Plymouth.  In Liberia they had already established a Constitution of organized republican government, courts, schools, communication to the interior, agriculture, and most importantly churches.  These accomplishments outstripped those by the first colonies of America in their first twenty-five years.","One of the main arguments by Everett was that Christianity guided the Africans into civilization and by the African Americans teaching the natives Christianity all will be civilized.  He said that the \"blessings of the Christians\" can be shown to Africa through the newly established colonies.  He thought that the influence of \"pure, unselfish, Christian love\" was the only influence that could never fail and that this alone civilized the world. Everett liked the idea of the spread of the Christian and American ideals to Africa more than the civilization of the Native Africans."],"display_date":"January 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-18","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4707,"title":"L.A.

The city of Los Angeles has long been a tense place in terms of race-relations.  The intermixing of different peoples set the stage for violent race riots in the early 1990s, which were kicked off when Rodney King was beat savagely in 1992 by four LAPD officers and the police were found innocent of all charges.  The trial and subsequent acquittal of OJ Simpson in 1995 added fuel to the simmering divides between ethnicities..  The race riots did not simply take place between blacks and whites—Latinos and Asians also feuded with those who did not share the same heritage.  The time for peaceful resolutions to these race problems had long since passed, as Los Angeles has always been more open to a diverse population more so than other cities in the United States.  The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> journalists noted: “In many ways, L.A. symbolizes the racism in this country like probably no other city.  It’s become the poster city for racism in America.”  The economic problems of Los Angeles during this time, as well as the constant drug trafficking, further intensified the racial tension in the City of Angels.  Residents of Los Angeles competed for money whether they could obtain it legally or illegally, and if a member of a different race took another race’s means to make a profit, racial hostility occurred. ","            The riots in the early 1990s were brutal; residents reported incidents of people being dragged out of their cars and being beaten.  All races were involved in the simmering tensions in Los Angeles.  Buildings were looted and set ablaze, and Los Angeles’s reputation would not recover from the highly publicized events.  “A place once viewed as idyllic and tolerant, a palm-lined paradise, has come to be seen as quite the opposite—a worst-case example” claimed the <em>Times</em> writers..  The Los Angeles Race Riots were large in scale and gave the city a tarnished image in the view of the rest of America.  Citizens of the city found out that the easiest way to avoid the racial problems was to avoid other groups altogether."],"display_date":1995,"search_date":"1995-07-02","locations":[{"id":43370,"lat":33.0342766311,"lng":-118.614221051,"zoom":8,"place":"Los Angeles, California"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":4708,"title":"Carmichael Calls for Black Militancy","course_id":26,"status":"P","start_date":"9/1/66","end_date":"9/30/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Many African-Americans had become frustrated with the slow rate of racial progress in the 1960s.  While Martin Luther King Jr. and others protested racial injustices in a nonviolent way, other African-American lost patience with the attitude of whites towards these movements.  Stokely Carmichael, a one-time non-violence believer, became an advocate and leader of the “Black Power” movement.  This movement called for a more violent and direct way of protesting against the inequality between whites and blacks.  “For too many years, black Americans marched and had their heads broken in and got shot,” Carmichael stated in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>.  Indeed, much of the peaceful resistance put up by King and other Civil Rights leaders served only to frustrate the white population rather than make them change.  While the south was full of passive protests, Northerners like Carmichael felt a growing anger inside with the way racial progress was going.","            Carmichael called for young black people to join his Black Power Movement, which was more aggressive in both speech and actions.  Carmichael denounced the concept of integration, saying that “. . . in order to have a decent house or education, blacks must move into a white neighborhood or send their children to a white school.”  Instead, he argued that blacks should have better facilities in the first place so they can be in a less hostile environment (presuming the hostility of schools consisting mainly of whites).","            This type of attitude appealed to many younger African-Americans who saw their parents and leaders of the Civil Rights Movement beaten down without any repercussions or retaliation.  The youth saw no progress being made and thought that a resistance that was not as passive may be the only way to get justice.

and, after allowance, their time was usually employed in hoeing their corn, and getting a supply of fish for the week.”[5]","Kingsley was definitely an opportunist; he recognized the economic compensation of keeping his slaves happy by giving them sufficient shelter.  The labor force will perform better when they are content, thus increasing productivity.  Also he was considered an economic opportunist of his time because after Zephaniah Kingsley bought slaves, he would train and teach them labor and sell the slaves for more.  He undoubtedly acknowledged the importance of keeping his slaves pleased by providing them with above average cabins, in order to have run successful plantation.  For the most part, Kingsley respected the slaves and valued their hard work.","Zephaniah Kingsley was extremely wealthy due to the fact that he was a slave owner in an incredibly lucrative industry of manual labor in the developing United States.  The more wealthy an individual was the higher they were classified in society.  Clearly, large slave owners were considered to be in the upper class.  However, Zephaniah Kingsley was not well respected among society because he married one of his African woman slaves that resided in one of the tabby cabins.[6]  Race greatly affected one’s class in society.  When the United States purchased the entire state of Florida from Spain in 1821, race relations changed.  Under Spanish rule, society was broken up into whites, free people of color, and slaves.  “But the Americans arriving in the new U.S. territory in record numbers viewed all black people-slave and free alike-as members of an inferior race and unworthy of freedom.” Although Kingsley supported slavery due to the economic benefits, “Kingsley urged the Territorial Council to pass laws encouraging emancipation.”[7] Zephaniah Kingsley was mainly known as a slave owner, but was much more than just that; he was an opportunist, economist, and activist.  Kingsley’s idea of improving housing of slavery epitomizes how he ran his plantation differently than other large plantations."," "," "],"display_date":"1803 - 1821","search_date":"1812-07-01","locations":[{"id":15818,"lat":32.3884987877,"lng":-82.3675347364,"zoom":8,"place":"Montgomery, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":163,"tag":"Slave master"},{"id":412,"tag":"slave conditions"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":436,"tag":"florida slave history"},{"id":455,"tag":"Plantation Life"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4896,"title":"A look at the evolution of the slave trade through the eyes of a slave trader.","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It is the year 1826, 30 years after the American Revolution boldly stated that all men are created equal, but this first-hand account of Theodore Canot, an Italian adventurer paints a much darker picture of the times. Brantz Mayer’s 1854 work, “Captain Canot; Twenty Years of an African Slaver” vividly describes his friend’s grizzly profession; providing a historical document unmatched in detail and accuracy. Captain Canot becomes notorious in the Americas and West Africa as a ferocious slave trader who acquired slaves through both capture and as plunder from other vessels. He represented a new age of the slave trade, a post-revolution day when slavery and race had becomes so deeply intertwined. This primary document provides insight into the slave trade after the American Revolution, a business rooted in the beliefs of racial inferiority more than the need for labor.","The memoir provides an inside look into the cruel practice of slave trading, which continued on much longer than one might think. Almost a century after Thomas Jefferson inked that timeless phrase in the Declaration of Independence, hypocrisy combined with an expanding demand for slave labor on plantations in the South contributed to the continuation of the Atlantic slave trade. Even after the Emancipation Proclamation, in America, the trading in human beings continued nearby. Cuba and Brazil, for example did not abolish slavery until 1886, and 1888, respectively, and an illegal slave trade was present right up until the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (1). The desire for profit often outweighed any moral dilemmas associated with trafficking men and women. This was certainly true in the case of Captain Canot, a man who had lived many years in Baltimore. The idea that Africans were racially inferior and therefore “sub-human” legitimized the practice in the eyes of many Americans. While the antislavery movement gained steam in some northern areas, the belief that blackness and slavery are one in the same held in the South. Slavery was no longer about labor owed to another person, no longer something one can buy out of, but simply being black meant you were a slave for life.","With this belief system, Canot had no trouble capturing, abusing and selling Africans, even branding them “with pieces of silver wire or small irons fashioned into initials heated just hot enough to blister without burning the skin”(2). The brutal treatment continues as the slaves are boarded onto the ship, “Officer, whip in hand, range the slaves in place, those on the right side of the vessel facing forward and lying in each other’s lap while those on the left are similarly stowed with their faces towards the stern” (2).  While packing these proud people into the ship like sardines, they arranged them in a particular way because this was “considered preferable for the action of the heart” (2). Canot and his crew simply thought of Africans as cargo, something to be delivered and kept alive, rather than human beings.","The idea of Africans being sub-human was not new. It had developed through hundreds of years of slavery. Both Europeans and Africans were involved in the development of this idea, as slavery had existed on the continent long before Europeans had set foot there. Mayer asserts that “slavery and the careers of men like Canot must be the fruit of Africa’s own fatal flaws,” demonstrating his belief that Africans themselves were the main culprits in the continuation of the slave trade. Mayer asserts that Africa is a continent “unstirred by progress… full of the barbarism that blood and tradition have handed down from the beginning” (2). Basically, while European slave traders and American plantation owners participated in treating people like property, the state of Africa itself was the main cause of the spread of slavery.","However they originated, the racist beliefs that Africans are sub-human and therefore property have marked our country’s history. These ideas precipitated racial tensions that have persisted to some degree even in modern America. The story of Theodore Canot is a powerful look into the evolution of racism. It is unique in that it both graphically details the cruelty and brutality of the slave trade, and provides insight into how these men could have possibly justified their horrific actions."],"display_date":"1826 - 1850","search_date":"1838-07-02","locations":[{"id":5928,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"},{"id":1281,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":157,"tag":"Transatlantic Slave Trade"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4898,"title":"How one woman helped to valut African American culture into the spotlight","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"10/29/32","end_date":"10/29/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Born in 1891 in rural Alabama, Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood in the first incorporated black town in the nation, Eatonville, Florida. Zora attended school in Eatonville until only 13 years old, when she traveled to New York City with a traveling theatre company. In the city that never sleeps, Zora would develop her creative mind and make her mark on history. Hurston seized the tremendous opportunity of living in New York during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of blossoming of African American culture through music, poetry, dance and other forms of media. First, she obtained three degrees from illustrious learning institutions including Columbia University and Howard University. Soon after, she was blessed with a shot to work with Langston Hughes, arguably the most famous black writer in American History, on a play entitled, “Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts.” Hurston went on to publish books such as the 1934 work “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” detailing African American life in the deep-south and bringing it to the forefront of society. Through her life’s work and experiences, Zora Neale Hurston exposed the masses to African American life and folklore, broke racial boundaries, and inspired change here in Central Florida and across the nation.","Growing up in Eatonville, Hurston was fully immersed in African American culture and folklore. She specialized in theatre and comedy decided to pursue her interests further at Columbia. During her academic years, she conducted extensive field studies throughout the American South, becoming an expert in the field. Here at Rollins College, interest in American folklore was mounting. In a letter from October 29<sup>th</sup>1932, Professor W.R. Wunsch pleads with school President Dr. Hamilton Holt to allow an African American folk performance in the Annie Russell Theatre. Wunsch challenges the President to “break the ground as it were: to make the students sensitive to the lyric beauty of swamp and citrus grove, […] find the drama in the life of fisherfolk and sponge divers, […] to get the students to ‘dip their nets where they are.’” He goes on to specifically request Hurston, insisting that he “can think of no better way to introduce the students to the honest-to-the-soil material at their own doorsteps than to present to them in a program of folk songs and dancers a group of Eatonville negroes, headed by Zora Hurston. Zora, a national authority on negro ways, has won an enviable place for herself in American dramatics.” Clearly, there was desire for Zora’s expertise and creativity in the field local folklore here at Rollins, but the President was somewhat apprehensive to approve because of the well established racial boundaries of the time.","These pre-existing racial boundaries were tremendously difficult for African Americans to overcome, as the Jim Crow laws of segregation were still widely in effect. Dr. Holt illustrates this in his response to Mr. Wunsch’s letter. He allows the performance to take place, however, he adds, “Of course we cannot have negroes in the audience unless there is a separate place segregated for them.” Holt continues by hinting that he fears the judgment of others, warning, “I do not think I would advertise it very much outside our own faculty and students.” This mentality held widely throughout the south was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Hurston did an incredible job of shrinking the barriers by thrusting the lives and cultures of African Americans into mainstream society. Her first book, entitled “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” was critically acclaimed as something totally new and fresh. Additionally, her academic success provided opportunity and paved the way for many African American women to follow.","The Harlem Renaissance set the stage for real progress in America. The timeless works of Hurston, Hughes, and countless other intellectuals, artists, poets and entertainers provided the building blocks for the Civil Rights Movement. This cultural movement shined the African-American experience in the spotlight, and in turn changed how African Americans were perceived. As rural, southern blacks moved north to larger cities, they developed a new image, one of urban sophistication. The idea of the black identity was forming, and antiquated, racist laws could no longer suppress it. In his response letter, Dr. Holt acknowledges that he is in favor of racial progress, telling the courageous Mr. Wunsch, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”","Zora Neale Hurston achieved incredible things in her lifetime. She won numerous awards as an actor, playwright and author. But arguably her most important contributions to this world came in the form of advancing her people and fighting for equality. Through hard work, a will to succeed, and being in the right place at the right time, she inspired true change in our country. Hurston is a figure that will be forever immortalized through her works and accomplishments, an integral part of African American and Florida history."],"display_date":"October 29, 1932","search_date":"1932-10-29","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"},{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":85,"tag":"Harlem Renaissance"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5129,"title":"<strong>The 1966 Hough Riots</strong>","course_id":59,"status":"P","start_date":"7/18/66","end_date":"7/24/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the late night hours of July 18, 1966, 26-year-old Joyce Arnett walked through Cleveland’s Hough neighborhood with two friends. As they approached E. 83<sup>rd</sup> Street, police officers ushered them into the second floor of a nearby building. The police presence had recently arrived to disperse a large crowd that had gathered on the street. Mrs. Arnett, a mother of three who lived nearby, ventured onto a balcony overlooking the street, calling for her three children. As she stepped onto the second story balcony, she was shot. After being rushed to nearby Mount Sinai Hospital, she was pronounced dead at 1:40am.","Joyce Arnett was one of four victims in what later came to be known as the Hough Riots. The riots, which lasted from July 18 to July 23, 1966, were a result of increasing racial tensions between working class African Americans and more affluent Whites in the neighborhood. African American residents were incensed at deplorable living conditions in rented apartments, exorbitant rents and food prices, and frequent incidences of police brutality at the hands of a predominantly White police force. On July 18, this tense situation quickly escalated into violence after the White owner of a bar on Hough Avenue in the neighborhood refused to serve an African American man. A large crowd, composed mainly of African Americans, soon gathered on the street, throwing rocks. Police arrived shortly thereafter and reported being shot at from snipers in the immediate area. The disorder in the neighborhood continued for several days. On July 20, Police Captain James Birmingham described the situation as being “like the part in an old western where you’re caught in the crossfire in a box canyon”. That same day, 36-year-old Percy Giles was shot on Hough Avenue, becoming the second victim of the riots. Sam Winchester and Benoris Toney were the final two victims, having both been fatally shot on subsequent days. All four of the victims were African American. The riot finally ended on July 24 following heavy rains which kept most of the neighborhood’s residents indoors.","The riot ultimately deepened the rift between African Americans and Whites in Cleveland. The all-white Cuyahoga County Grand Jury Commission fully blamed the riot on black militants, echoing the views of many Whites. Conversely, African Americans in the area claimed that the riot was the inevitable result of substandard living conditions in the predominantly African American inner city. Following the riot, almost all middle class residents left Hough, shutting down a majority of the neighborhood’s businesses. This had a devastating effect on the neighborhood, which years later had become one of the poorest in Cleveland. The riots had the effect of speeding up the process of white flight in the city, considerably deepening the rift between the poorer mainly African American inner city and richer mainly White suburbs, a division which still exists to this day."],"display_date":"July 18, 1966 - July 24, 1966","search_date":"1966-07-21","locations":[{"id":31669,"lat":41.4243718872,"lng":-81.6586944761,"zoom":9,"place":"Cuyahoga, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":825,"tag":"Riot"},{"id":826,"tag":"Cleveland"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to American History","school":"Case Western Reserve University","course_id":59,"school_id":41}},{"id":5203,"title":"The Self-Integration Of Pembroke State College","course_id":63,"status":"P","start_date":"7/3/56","end_date":"7/3/56","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1956, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) had “a record enrollment of 124 in its summer session,” wrote a journalist for <em>The Robesonian</em>.  The reason for this record breaking enrollment was clear: more white students were taking advantage of the university’s summer sessions.  UNCP, then known as Pembroke State College (PSC), started admitting whites in 1953, one year prior to the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> case.  For decades the university was an Indian-only institution for the advancement Indian students.  But since its foundation in 1887, PSU “expanded, physically and culturally, and has become able to accommodate more students.”  Even though only two of three races who lived in Robeson County were being admitted, for its time the facility served as a model for racial integration in education.","This integration happened because of many elements and advantages that were “mutually agreeable to members of both races” during the university’s self-integration.  None of the other state educational institutions in the counties surrounding Robeson offered summer classes.  All enrolled students were at least eighteen years old and lived independently off the campus.  This meant, according to the article, that the students had the option of coming and going as they pleased to fit their schedules, without any interference from social or family factors.  Besides white students having the opportunity for summer education, Pembroke State needed the increased enrollment to keep itself running as a valuable state institution.  Probably the biggest factor was that students of both races had a shared interest in being educated.  “They are attending college for the purpose of learning,” the paper noted.  There was no intended agenda for advancing, nor preventing, integration. ","When integration was put into law, however, many in the Lumbee community opposed it.  PSC was created during the time of government-sanctioned segregation in education.  The school served as a way that the Lumbee tribe could stand on its own and not have to deal with interference from the white majority in local governance; and, at the same time, prevent their community from being classed with the African American population in the area. Since years before the institution’s foundation, and even today, Lumbee Indians have had to fight for legal recognition and tribal benefits.  The “Cherokee Chief” stereotype, which is still present in the athletic mascots of today, prevents the Lumbee from being legitimized as a tribe in the eyes of the government because they are not seen as “real” Indians.  The creation of UNCP was one of the few ways that the Lumbee were recognized as a tribe.  Educator James Author Jones, who grew up in the Indian only school system, wrote that the Lumbee Indians “remembered their ancestors’ struggle to establish their own school in the 1800s . . . . Such a fight resulted in the establishment of the Indian only school system, a symbol of tribal autonomy, and the founding of what would become the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.” The struggle was about keeping the institution for Indian only education, which, ironically, was actually brought into existence because of segregation.","Despite this resistance, integration of UNCP, and all other educational institutions in the United States, did eventually happen.  Schools were required to integrate, according to Jefferson Currie II, “with all deliberate speed” according to the outcome of the 1954 Supreme Court case of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.  In 1954, according to the UNCP website, the schools doors were open to “all qualified applicants without regards to race.”  Few students took advantage of this during the spring and fall semesters, however, delaying the real impact of integration. UNCP integration thus happened at what many believed to be a more natural pace, under the circumstances.  But because of the factors that influenced the enrollment of white students during summer sessions, UNCP’s integrated was believed, and turned out, to be inevitable."],"display_date":"July 3, 1956","search_date":"1956-07-03","locations":[{"id":30574,"lat":34.6401072699,"lng":-79.1035356779,"zoom":9,"place":"Robeson, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":937,"tag":"integration/segregation"},{"id":938,"tag":"lumbee indians"},{"id":934,"tag":"Pembroke State College"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":63,"school_id":9}},{"id":5235,"title":"An African American Worker at Sloss Furnace Encounters the Color Line","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/25","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["'\"A nigger can't bid for a white man's job.\" was how Alonzo Gaines described labor divisions among African Americans and whites at the time he was employed at Sloss Furnaces in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1984 Gaines sat down in an interview with the Sloss Furnace Association with the goal of recording his thoughts on his career at Sloss Furnaces, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. In the course of his interview he recounted his own personal experiences with this workplace segregation. According to Gaines while he was employed at the concrete plant he had been instructed to operate a machine called the compressor when it usual operator, a man by the name of McDonald, was off work. Eventually the position of compressor operator became open and interested workers began applying for the position, or as they called it, biding on the job. Gaines too applied as he had already been operating the compressor for some time but when he approached the superintendent, a man by the name of Lawson, he was summarily denied the position in favor a white applicant. Superintendent Lawson informed Gaines frankly, “You can run it just as good as McCan, but you ain't gonna get it.\"","The “Color Line” that Gaines had encountered served as a barrier to African American workplace advancement in the south for decades. The south had developed strict delineations between what were considered “white” and “black” positions. According to historian William A. Sundstrom the color line segregated African Americans and whites, “along lines of skill levels, supervisory responsibilities, and manual versus white-collar tasks,” in many industries. It was implicitly understood and, as Gaines testimony shows, sometime explicitly stated that an African American worker would not have a supervisory position over a white worker. This is exactly what happened to Gaines when he applied for the compressor operator position; despite having the necessary skills to operate the machine he was told upfront that he would never get the position. That position was considered a “white job” and Gaines was denied the opportunity simply because of an ingrained prejudice that placed some positions at a higher social status that would then denied to those who were considered lower in social rank, even inspite of their proven capacity to perform the work required of that position."],"display_date":"1925 - 1950","search_date":"1937-12-31","locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5271,"title":"Black Family Challenges Racial Barriers in Suburb","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On August 13, 1957, Daisy and Bill Myers moved their family to a well-developed suburb in Levittown, Pennsylvania.  They were just like every other eager newcomer to arrive in Levittown, except that they were black.  As news of this Levittown “first” quickly spread, so did the curiosity.  Drivers continuously circled the house in their automobiles, trying to catch a glimpse of the first African American residents of Levittown.  Other interested citizens gathered near the house to share in their disbelief.  Only hours after the family moved in, violence erupted in the traditionally quiet community.  This “Levittown Incident” was documented in a <em>New York Times</em> article from August 25, 1957, revealing the racism that plagued this sprawling suburban community.  A mere two days after the family had started preparing the house for the move, an angry crowd of 200 residents formed outside the home.  Demonstrators hurled stones at the house, shattering two panes of the picture window.  Police arrived on the scene to break up the crowd.  As Levittown historian David Kushner noted, “It was the first time in twenty-nine years a sheriff had been called in to restore order. But order wouldn’t come easily.”  More disapproving Levittowners returned to the Myers house the next evening.  In fact, as the <em>New York Times</em> reported, “Demonstrations continued almost nightly.”  Time and again, police arrived at the scene to suppress riots.  With the police protecting the house, “An uneasy peace descended on the neighborhood.”  However, the bitter reality of Northern racism remained.","With their innovative mass-production techniques, the housing developer Levitt & Sons helped alleviate the post-World War II housing crisis.  Despite the promise of affordable housing for all Americans, the company excluded blacks from their communities.  “This pattern of racial exclusion was set in 1947,” wrote historian Alexander O. Boulton.  However, William Levitt defended his company’s continued support of racial covenants.  As cited by historian Joshua Ruff, Levitt declared, “‘We can solve a housing problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem. But we cannot combine the two.’”  Thus, Levittown, Pennsylvania remained an all-white community.  “I have come to know that if we sell one house to a Negro family, then 90 to 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community. That is their attitude, not ours,” remarked Levitt in the <em>New York Times</em>.  However, as pointed out in the newspaper, “the builders had no say over the resale of houses.”  This is where the Myers family entered the picture.","In August 1957, a tight-knit, pleasant community became the scene of vicious uprisings.  The riots highlighted the bitter racial tensions of the time and revealed the legitimacy of Levitt’s concerns; Levittowners were not ready to welcome blacks into their community.  As noted by Kushner, Daisy Myers remembered picking up the little culprit that broke her window.  “‘The rock, weighing less than an ounce,’ as Daisy put it, ‘carried tons of hatred with it.’”  Such hatred rocked the town for weeks."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5272,"title":"Whites Riot in Response to Arrival of First African American Family in Levittown, PA","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Upon driving up to their new home at 43 Deepgreen Lane, Daisy Myers was filled with doubt, recalling that she repeatedly asked herself, “what would be the extent of our ostracism? Would we be able to sleep comfortably?” as she studied the four law officers standing on the lawn of her address in the Dogwood Hollow Section of Levittown. These questions regarding the neighborhood reaction to the arrival of a black family in what had been an intentionally all-white enclave, were unfortunately answered over the next two weeks. At dusk each evening, crowds of people gathered outside the Myer’s home, angrily shouting and jeering, singing the national Anthem, and throwing stones toward the Myer’s home, as apparently these “spacious skies,” they sang of were not meant to be enjoyed in an integrated setting. Levittown police failed to enforce the court ordered protection for the Myers, prohibiting more than three people from assembling near the residence at once. Mobs consequently gathered in this fashion each night, only finally subsiding due to interference from the state police. After an agonizing fourteen days, the riots ended, but the Myers continued to suffer the anxiety of the consequences triggered by the introduction of integration to Levittown. Harassment of the family persisted for almost three months, as Daisy Myers received threatening phone calls of those who “told [her] they threatened to shoot William down on sight,” the family’s deliveries of oil, bread, and milk stopped arriving, and the more than occasional unfriendly white stroller-by forced the Myers to have constant protection, or at the very least, sympathizing company. Anti-segregationist even obtained property immediately neighboring the Myers’ home, using the location to intimidate the family further, evident by their conspicuous display of the confederate flag.","The resistance seen in the August riots against the integration of Levittown, PA was not uncommon throughout suburban neighborhoods. Quite the contrary in fact, racial discrimination and the subsequent segregated communities were the norm in 1950s suburbia. Yet despite this plaguing harassment, the Myers refused to leave their Levittown home, justifiably feeling entitled “to live where [they] chose,” as William put it. Remarking on the family’s incredible determination to outlast their opponents, Dianne Harris, historian and author of <em>Second Suburb: Levittown, PA, </em>stated<em>, </em>“the Myers endured an ordeal that few could have weathered with such dignity, courage, grace, and fortitude.”"," ","This endurance allowed the family to break “the lily-white pattern of Levittown,” as Daisy Myers stated, a pattern that William Levitt had attempted to keep in existence in his planned suburban community. While he did not consider himself to hold racist ideals, Levitt had long refused to sell his homes to African Americans. Applications for home ownership in Levittown had to be made in person at the Levittown Exhibit Center Sales Office, allowing discrimination in the housing industry of the community to readily continue daily. Yet through the assistance received from the American Friends Service Committee, the Myers were able to circumvent these discriminatory practices, making headway in the racial trends of the neighborhood. Yet due to the overpowering ideals of many white residents, in combination with the ideals of Levitt and his employed real estate agents, the effects of the inequality are still seen in Levittown today, as the 2000 census identified ninety-eight percent of the town’s population as Caucasian."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5273,"title":"Levittown Real Estate Boards' Discriminatory Housing Practices Revealed","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/7/54","end_date":"8/7/54","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article published in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> in August of 1954 journalist Craig Thompson exposed the “problem of Negro exclusion,” commenting on the discriminatory practices employed by Levitt and the preventive covenants established by the local real estate boards within his suburban communities. As the father of modern suburbia, it seemed that with his prepackaged communities, he had also manufactured the ideal enclave for whites opposed to an integrated neighborhood – an enclave that beginning in the mid-1950s, was finally exposed for the inequalities of opportunity it had maintained.","Revolutionizing the housing industry, Levitt pioneered the affordable, planned suburban community, beginning his construction endeavors on the potato fields of Hempstead Plains on Long Island. With the mass production of homes, Levitt enabled past renters of urban-dwellings to become homeowners, an “embodiment of the American dream,” according to Kyle Sabo, a lifelong resident of the area. With this revolution of the housing industry, Levitt was praised by the media, with early articles and interviews speaking of the visionary vertical organization that Levitt employed in construction. Yet as the racist ploys throughout Levittown expanded, Levitt’s reputation shifted from a genius businessman to a prejudicial one, driven by his antagonistic views toward blacks and other minorities.","In the interview Thompson conducted with Levitt in 1954, the businessman denied any racist attitudes toward the black community. He defended his tactics as nothing more than techniques that were best for his business, stating, “as a company, [his] position was simple: [he] could solve a housing problem, or [he] could try to solve a racial problem. But [he] could not combine the two.”","Despite such claims however, the growing racist policies of Levitt’s suburbias could no longer escape public knowledge. Property owners, pressured into such contracts that prevented them from leasing or selling to blacks in the future had became common practice in Levittown. Residents were warned that violation of these conditions would not only result in penalty for themselves, but would cause an “invasion” of blacks into the town, bringing with it lower property values, crime, and danger to the very essence of suburbia. Even intermingling with blacks became dangerous, as Levitt evicted white families on the basis of welcoming black company in their suburban home.","With exposure of such practices, not surprisingly, came a growing opposition. In both Levitt’s Long Island community and his Bucks County community, resistance to segregation, as well as to blockbusting, grew. In Freeport, Long Island 240 white residents signed a petition, refusing to be solicited by local real estate agents. Black newspapers across the Bucks County area, notably the <em>Tribune, </em>issued articles filled with commentary of how Levitt’s towns were “breeding hate.” The Society of Friends became dedicated to circumventing the restrictive policies in place, successfully enabling the move-in of the first African American family to Levittown, PA in 1957. Such efforts alarmed whites opposed to integration, as uncovering of the problem increasingly incited reformist sentiment throughout such neighborhoods.","Despite the exposure, and accompanying intentions of challenging such policies, however, the suburban neighborhood of the 1950s served as the forerunner for what would become the trend across American suburbias for years to come. In the following decades, white communities throughout the country, aided by federal policy and the real estate agency, “protected” suburbia for themselves, fearful of the idea of an integrated community seeping into this type of residential setting. The effects have by no means disappeared in modern times, as the impact of such actions are still felt in Long Island’s Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as throughout Bucks county, which display significant racial disparities, regrettably referred to by residents as “a checkerboard of racially, ethnically, and economically segregated communities.”"," "],"display_date":"August 7, 1954","search_date":"1954-08-07","locations":[{"id":28529,"lat":40.9562853666,"lng":-73.0371992045,"zoom":9,"place":"Suffolk, New York"},{"id":29305,"lat":40.6374264514,"lng":-73.5488485883,"zoom":10,"place":"Nassau, New York"},{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5327,"title":"Freedmen Massacred at Opelousas","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-09-28","end_date":"1868-09-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Opelousas massacre occurred in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, on September 28, 1868. It centered around Emerson Bentley, a white editor for a local newspaper called <em>The Landry Progress </em>and an influential schoolteacher who promoted the education of black children. Bentley wrote an article that local members of the Seymour Knights, a branch unit of the white supremacist group The Knights of the White Camellia, deemed offensive. The backlash to the article led three men to take the attempt to intimidate and severely cane Bentley, causing him to flee St. Landry. Local blacks were told that Bentley had been murdered and banded together to retaliate. While marching towards Opelousas with arms in hand, efforts were made to inform the freedmen that Bentley had not been murdered but escaped; causing some of the men to retreat, while others continued to march.","The freedmen were met by armed whites determined to defend their town. Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range.","The Freedman’s Bureau ordered Lieutenant Lee to investigate the atmosphere of Opelousas. In an article written on October 8, Lee described the cause of the riot and the death count. He gave a low estimate in regards to the number of blacks killed, stating that only five died, but expressed his opinion that the death toll would increase due to blacks being unwilling to give up their arms to whites. Ultimately, Lee was positive in his reports, he believed that peace had been restored overall and stated, “no further trouble is apprehended.”","The end of the Civil War resulted in widespread violence in the South due to racial and political tensions. A majority of newly freed African Americans strongly supported the Republican Party, angering prominent southern Democrats. The inability to accept racial equality led to the growth of white supremacist groups, the most noteworthy being the Ku Klux Klan. White radicals sought to silence African Americans and those who supported them through various scare tactics and physical violence, such was the case at Opelousas.","Historian Carolyn DeLatte argued that the white Southerners acted in the same manner that they had for many years. This time, however, “the vengeance visited upon the Negroe population was greater, as blacks were no longer protected by any consideration of their monetary value.” The riot echoed its influence in the political as well as social arena, where whites bounded together to protect their rights from black infringement, and blacks stepped away from their right to vote in order to evade persecution."],"display_date":"September 28, 1868 - September 29, 1868","search_date":"1868-09-28","locations":[{"id":5698,"lat":30.5481655437,"lng":-92.2423441161,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LANDRY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5351,"title":"Rebel General Gantt Tells Arkansas to Return to the Union","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-08","end_date":"1863-11-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Confederate Brigadier General E.W. Gantt spoke to his fellow citizens of Arkansas, but also to all of the citizens of the South in his 1863 address.  The message in this address is that the Confederacy was fighting a war that they could never win and that the southern states would have more power and property if they would just return to the Union.  The General blamed several of the problems in the Confederacy on Jefferson Davis, for whom he had little respect.  He described Davis as “Cold, selfish, and supremely ambitious.”  Gantt also pointed out that the Confederacy was not sufficient in terms of foreign policy and he called Davis’s ideas “a stupid failure.”","Gantt urged those in the South at the time to give up the fight and return to the Union.  He felt that surrender was sometimes the best option and that southerners should look past ideas of humiliation.  He explained his reasoning by saying, “Our armies are melting and ruin approaches us.  Will continuing this struggle help us?”  The General also felt that the North had too much invested in the war to give up the fight and that it was foolish of southerners to think that they ever will.","Gantt sought to reason with citizens of the South by claiming that, “Each day makes new graves, new orphans, and new mourners.  Each hour flings into this dreadful whirlpool of wrecked hopes, broken fortunes, and anguished hearts.”  He also explained that, “Negro slavery has accomplished its mission here,” in an attempt to show southern whites that slavery was not something that could continue to be sustainable.","The most interesting thing about E.W. Gantt was that he had been an ardent supporter of the secessionist movement prior to the war.  Even before the secession of the southern states Gantt proclaimed, “My life, my all, and laying them upon her altar, offering them up freely in defense of her insulted honor, wounded pride, and priceless freedom.”  It is interesting to hear Gantt’s thoughts about the South prior to the war and his decision to become a Union loyalist.","Despite Gantt’s pre-war beliefs it is apparent that he would stick to his newfound Unionist ideology.  He became the Arkansas state prosecutor for the Little Rock Reconstruction authorities.  The former General also served as a supervisor for the Freedman’s Bureau in Southwest Arkansas from 1865 to 1866.   Gantt ended his life working on a state law digest for Arkansas for which he was appointed by the Governor to complete.","Bruce S.

To do so, they needed to relocate to areas that were less populated than the North. Despite their admiration for South Carolina’s “lands and climate,” northerners feared living in the state, because of the potential violence. During this time, South Carolina began enacting black codes to restrict the freedoms and movements of freedmen. Northerners believed it to be only a matter of time until blacks started protesting the laws. While other states in the South enacted similar codes, these northerners thought South Carolina’s to be the harshest. Because of this, they chose to settle in the northwest rather than the South.","White residents of South Carolina did not believe the state had a lack of migrants due to the black codes. Instead, they expressed the opinion that white northerners were apprehensive to live among such a large number of free blacks. A writer for the <em>Nashville Press </em>article vehemently denounced this claim. “It is not true white immigrants will not go where there are negro laborers, or where there is negro competition. The sole condition of immigration is embraced in the word security.”","For these settlers, the number one concern was safety. They believed that as long as the codes were in effect, security could never exist in the state. Settlers, or emigrants, were not the ones negatively affected by the codes. They found suitable land for their intended purposes in other parts of the country. The people who the codes hurt, the article argued, were the residents of South Carolina. As long as the black codes were in place, immigration would not occur. If the codes were abolished, there would be “unprecedented progress of the South” as a result of new settlement.","South Carolina began passing black codes immediately following the war. The state ratified a constitution in 1865 that forbade blacks from voting. In order to prevent blacks from combating the laws, South Carolina set up racial restrictions for entering office. This way, no black person could enter South Carolina’s legislature and attempt to do away with the codes.","Besides preventing blacks to enter political office, the black codes in South Carolina stopped freedmen from becoming an “artisan, mechanic, or shopkeeper” without the proper license from a judge. This license cost more than $100, making it unlikely a free black could afford one. Perhaps the most restrictive of all parts of the codes, was the section that limited black migration to the state.

In 1866 the legislature of Louisiana called new elections, allowing for a former Confederate mayor to regain his title. The state legislature overturned Wells’ veto. As a result, Wells gave his support to a Radical plan to reassemble the constitutional convention that occurred in 1864. The Radical plan would grant power to blacks, prevent former Confederates from voting, and lay the foundation for a modified state government for Louisiana.","Those opposed to the idea of Louisiana becoming a “revolutionized” state, the city police force of New Orleans, which was comprised of Confederate veterans, was supposed to maintain order during the convention but supported the opponents of Radicals. On July 30, twenty-five delegates and 200 black supporters, consisting primarily of former veterans, convened in New Orleans. When the two sides met, fighting broke out followed by gunshots. The delegates took cover in the convention hall. Those who tried to escape were immediately shot, the white flags they held in their hands as a sign of surrender were ignored. The total death toll consisted of thirty-four blacks and three white Radicals to be killed. Around 100 people were injured in the riot.","The <em>New York Times</em> described the event as a dispute between angry radicals and thugs, the police force, describing them as, “unprincipled scoundrels, thirsting for blood, whose every moral sensibility had been blunted by lives of desperados, were maddened to informal rage by injudicious harangues from men who follow in the stormy wake of Sumner and Stevens.” Republicans reported that the death toll was around 200 men, a fact in which the article questioned.  The Military Commission went  in to investigate the riot and the <em>Times </em>argued that the instigators would be deemed guilty due to the close allegiance that members of the Commission had with the Radicals.","Historian Eric Foner argued the significance of the New Orleans riot, stating, that it completely took away any hope of Presidential Reconstruction in Louisiana. Supposedly, before the riot occurred, the local military commander stationed at New Orleans warned the President of the violence that would occur if the convention happened. Johnson did not adequately prepare for the violence or take the warning to heart. Foner summed up the New Orleans Riot, stating, “But the stark fact remained that nearly all the victims had been blacks and convention delegates, and that the police, far from preserving order, had joined in the assault.”"],"display_date":"July 30, 1866","search_date":"1866-07-30","locations":[{"id":5599,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5350,"title":"Attorney General William on Enforcement Acts","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-04-02","end_date":"1875-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Colfax massacre of 1872, believed to be the most devastating occurrence of racial violence during Reconstruction, resulted in the death of around 150 freedmen at the hands of white supremacists. The events at Colfax resulted in only three men to convicted. However, disagreement led to the case entering the Supreme Court in the form of <em>United States v. Cruikshank </em>in 1876. The case brought in to question the constitutionality of the Enforcement Acts. It questioned if the federal government had the jurisdiction to enforce these acts on the state level.","The Enforcement Acts were issued in 1870 and 1871; they sought to prevent intimidation of voters and discrimination based on one’s skin color. The Acts also issued specific crimes committed by the Ku Klux Klan as federal offenses and those who committed them would be punished based on federal standards. Many white Southerners believed the Enforcement Acts were a violation of State’s rights. During the <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank </em>Supreme Court case, Attorney General Williams argued that the Enforcement Acts were necessary to protect the right to vote for African Americans. Williams argued that government could not exist without votes from its citizens, and as citizens, African Americans deserve the opportunity to cast their vote. He stated, “If Congress has no power to protect the voters, then the White League of Louisiana, a minority of the people, can stand around the polls and prevent the majority from voting.”","The results of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em> were devastating for those in support of the Enforcement Act. The men were charged with using their power to halt African Americans from voting. However, the government did not charge them with using race as a motive in the massacre. The error in wording resulted in the three men to going free, leaving no one held responsible for the horrific massacre against the freedmen.","The Court went further to state that the federal government only had the right to prohibit the violations of black rights in states only, they did not hold the power for punishing criminal acts committed by individuals, the state and local authority held this right. Historian Eric Foner commented, “In the name of federalism, the decision rendered national prosecution of crimes committed against blacks virtually impossible, and gave a green light to acts of terror where local officials either could not or would not enforce the law.” The devastating result of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em>, allowed acts of violence against freedmen and republicans to escalate in the following years because of the inability of the federal government to try individuals."],"display_date":"April 2, 1875","search_date":"1875-04-02","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5352,"title":"Display of the Confederate Flag in Richmond Sparks Anger in Congress","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-02-17","end_date":"1867-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 17, 1867 the <em>New York Times</em> reported on an act of reoccurring rebelliousness that happened within the city of Richmond, Virginia.  The incident that sparked all of the emotion was the display of the Confederate Flag during an event within the city.  Members of Congress and other Union loyalists decided that this act of rebelliousness proved that some of the southern states such as Virginia were, “utterly unfit for reconstruction” and that “the rebellious spirit still lived and raged in the South.”","Many called for legislation that would put the southern states under complete military rule.  The article went on to explain that the incident in question was actually just two young boys, one white and one black, pretending to be soldiers with an old faded flag that did not resemble that of the Confederate battle flag.

Baltimore’s Jews responded to this pressure through organizations like the Jewish Educational Alliance. These Jews embraced Americanism so dearly because they came largely from Germany, Russia, and Eastern Europe. In these countries, they had spent the last half-century struggling to even be given the ability to be recognized as citizens.  In contrast, the promise of freedom and equality in America --even though America rarely lived fully to its promise-- was an attractive alternative.

Liuzzo was shot while she ferried people during the Civil Rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. Liuzzo had identified herself as a keen supporter and worker for the Civil Rights movement in the South, and the burning of the cross outside of her home in the North is evidence of the Ku Klux Klan claiming responsibility for her murder. ","Cross burning is a long established form of hate crime and is specified in many state laws: “burning crosses with the intent to cause alarm among African Americans was symbolic speech, and the statute was an illegal censorship of the right of expression.” The newspaper’s mild account of the incident may be partly intentional in order to avoid alienating parts of their readership, which may include racist sympathisers. Jeannine Bell addresses this possibility: “Often acts of anti-integrationist violence look like petty crimes – vandalism or other property damage…local officials must understand that a cross-burning is not just an arson.” It may also be for this reason that coverage of the cross burning outside of the Liuzzo household is minimal, with only a brief mention in Mary Stanton’s biography of Viola Liuzzo.","Despite the clear involvement of the Ku Klux Klan in Viola Liuzzo’s murder due to evidence provided by Gary Thomas Rowe – Ku Klux Klan member and FBI informant – the language used in the article reveals the power that the organisation had over journalism and the general public. When considering who set the cross alight, the newspaper accuses “pranksters, bigots, or punks…it will be interesting to see just what kind of strange people they are.” Historian Gary May claims that even President Johnson used relatively tame rhetoric when acknowledging the Klan’s involvement, and appealing to them to end their activities: “If Klansmen hear my voice today, let it be both an appeal – and a warning – to get out of the Klan now and return to a decent society.” The focus centered on the Klu Klux Klan’s involvement in the murder in Alabama, and both journalists and historians alike fail to stress the significance of the racially motivated cross burning back in Michigan.","This case stands out due to the victimisation of a white female in the North, while most other incidents of cross burning targeted African-Americans in the South. Viola Liuzzo’s husband and her five children faced other forms of violence after the murder, including “obscene phone calls and hate mail.” The burning cross is, however, a symbol strongly associated with Klan activity, and establishes their presence in a neighbourhood previously considered a fair distance from the more public troubles of the South."],"display_date":"April 1, 1965","search_date":"1965-04-01","locations":[{"id":52862,"lat":42.331427,"lng":-83.0457538,"zoom":7,"place":"Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2858,"tag":"Hate Crime"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}}]}
