The article was addressed to the paper’s editor and criticized the lack of an adequate establishment for the education of young ladies in the town. The author argued that women’s education was necessary in order for women to better educate their children. Two months later, in March 1828, Elizabeth Ricord announced the opening of the Geneva Female Seminary. This seminary would be located in Geneva and would provide young women from the town, and from across the country, with the opportunity to receive an education.","These two events, the criticism of Geneva’s lack of female instruction and the opening of Ricord’s seminary, were typical of the time period because they reflected the growth of female schools that occurred in the United States between 1790 and 1850. These episodes also demonstrate the two contradicting arguments that both promoted the education of women. The first argument promoted women’s education on the grounds of Republican Motherhood, or the idea that women should be educated so they would be able to better educate their children to become Republican citizens. The author of <em>The Gazette</em> article demonstrated this ideal when he argued that, “since the most important part of that time in which the mind is to be formed and the inclinations properly directed, is almost exclusively passed under the government of females, the regular instruction of our daughters is an object of the first magnitude.” In contrast, some Americans also began to support women’s education because it brought them closer to equality with men. These advocates were influenced by the ideas of women’s rights supporter Mary Wollstonecraft who argued that women were not naturally inferior to men, but the lack of education they received created their inferiority. Ricord’s catalogue reflected Wollstonecraft’s ideas when it posed the question, “In the other sex, a well balanced mind is thought of inestimable value: why not in ours?” Despite their contradictory nature, these two views on why women should be educated contributed to the creation of numerous female schools across the United States and the expansion of women’s education."],"display_date":"January 16, 1828 - March 16, 1828","search_date":"1828-02-14","locations":[{"id":9088,"lat":43.2613440596,"lng":-76.9589722947,"zoom":9,"place":"SENECA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":539,"tag":"Women's Seminaries"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":552,"tag":"women's education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4989,"title":"<strong>Elizabeth Ricord Opens Female Seminary in Upstate New York </strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-05-01","end_date":"1829-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In May, 1829, the Geneva Female Seminary opened for its first school year with only about 15 students. It continued to grow and develop under the leadership of Elizabeth Ricord, the founder and principal of the school, and six years later, enrolled over 120 students. During the early American republic period, hundreds of female academies sprang up throughout the nation in both cities and the countryside, proving that these institutions were becoming an important part of American life. The growing opportunity to earn an education helped redefine the role of women as it gave them the knowledge and skills to participate in American civil society.","Ricord designed her academic courses to teach students how to think and reason. The school offered basic courses like spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, history, botany, philosophy, chemistry, algebra, geometry, rhetoric, and political economy. There was even a course specifically designed for preparing students for the “duties of society,” called Practical Knowledge. Ricord encouraged her students to “seek more lofty objects” and use their education in a constructive way. She also placed a special emphasis on religion and mental philosophy, as she was especially interested in these topics. Ricord and other teachers at the seminary believed it was very important for young women to develop strong morals. In fact, this was one of the main purposes for women to earn an education at Ricord’s seminary.","Ricord wrote there was an “uncommon degree of order, regularity, and moral rectitude” among the students. The laws of reason, conscience, and the Bible ruled the seminary. The middle-class women who graduated from these seminaries claimed to have “female moral superiority,” which influenced the way they engaged in civil society. Female seminaries during the early republic era helped cultivate the position of women as moral agents whose job was to raise virtuous children and teach them the ways of the Bible. After earning an education, many women became school teachers to fulfill this new role.","Female academies played a significant role in pushing women into the public sphere and helped them become active members in the developing civil society. Many of the women who graduated from these academies went on to become reformers and worked to help abolish slavery, to petition for women’s suffrage, to help feed the poor, and to combat men’s dominant role in politics.  The teachers in the female seminaries trained a new generation of women to be able to engage in politics and form individual opinions on local and national issues. Elizabeth Ricord’s commitment to educating women transformed the lives of her students and helped redefine the role of women in American society."," "],"display_date":"May 1829","search_date":"1829-05-16","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":642,"tag":"Civil Society"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":539,"tag":"Women's Seminaries"},{"id":552,"tag":"women's education"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}}]}
