Slavery was the most successful industry in the United States when even over the booming railroad industry. The main cause of the civil war is slavery because of its importance to the south. The south threatened and eventually left the union due to abolishing slavery. Abolishing slavery within the states would affect the each state economy. The states that had a larger population of slaves would be more affected if slavery was to ever be abolished. The state of Virginia held the most slaves throughout the south, nearly five hundred thousand slaves."," ","By 1861, Slavery in the south was understood as the reasoning behind the cause of the civil war and secession. Since the state of Virginia held most the enslaved population in America, the state played a vital role in the possible secede. Voters at the Virginia Convention who lived in greater enslaved population voted on more supporters for the secession. Voters who lived in smaller enslaved population did not vote as much to support the idea of secession. Lewis E. Harvie discussed the secession by representing Amelia and Nottoway County, two counties that held seventy percent of their population in slavery. <br />","The picture above showed the slave population distribution in Virginia in 1860 based on the state's population. The map features the list of counties in Virginia and its population of whites, slaves, and a number of slaves in the county. It also shows Virginia western counties that are now part of West Virginia which were insignificant in slave population. It also showed the percentage of the slave population in Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains. Most of these counties plantations held more than fifty slaves. The Shenandoah Valley and the Appalachians had fewer due to the geography and environmental disadvantages that discouraged plantations.The map shows the reality of the mass population of slavery within Virginia.","<br />The southern state's economy depended on slave labor, it continued through the civil war to the thirteenth Amendment in 1865. The eastern part of Virginia, an agriculture-based economy, had the highest percentage of slaves. The mountain area in Western Virginia depended more on an industrial industry, had a fewer population in slaves. Slavery in Virginia was vital to Civil War and Reconstruction era, due to its majority of the slave population."],"display_date":"1861 - 1865","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":53053,"lat":37.1148487,"lng":-78.0195387,"zoom":8,"place":"Nottoway County,Virginia"},{"id":53052,"lat":37.3212714,"lng":-77.973865,"zoom":8,"place":"Virginia, Amelia"}],"tags":[{"id":3313,"tag":"slave population"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2930,"tag":"Virginia"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6713,"title":"The Stone Wall","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"4/16/17","end_date":"4/18/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout the Civil War, there were some great commanders in both the Confederate and Union armies. One commander that stood out to me was Thomas Jackson. Jackson graduated from West Point, a U.S Military academy around 1846. Being that he graduated around that time he was able to fight in the Mexican War which lasted from 1846-1848.  After fighting in the Mexican War, he went on to pursue a teaching career. After teaching for a while, the secession of Virginia came about in 1861. After Virginia seceded from the Union, jackson took immediate action to join the Confederate army.","<strong><br /></strong>","After joining the army, the first wave of secession was already in place. The first wave lasted from December of 1860 through February of 1861. During the first wave, seven southern states took action and declared their independence from the Union. Throughout the first wave, Jackson hoped that his home state, Virginia, would remain in the Union. Although his home state seceded, he continued to show his loyalty towards his state rather than the Federal Government. In the army, Jackson originally served as colonel until he was promoted to brigadier general under General Joseph E. Johnston. Being that Jackson taught artillery tactics, he would have no problem leading men on the battlefield.","<strong><br /></strong>","Of course the first battle of the war came, and Jackson was ready to fight. The first battle in the Civil War was the Battle of Bull Run. In this first battle Jackson earns his nickname. His nickname comes about through a Union general. As Jackson rushed his men to close a gap against union attack, a Union general said “Look men, there’s Jackson standing like a stone wall”. After that day Thomas Jackson became known as “Stonewall” Jackson.  Some people might question why someone would just be standing in the middle of a battle. Later on during the Civil War, Jackson was eventually commissioned as a major general.","<strong><br /></strong>","Throughout the Civil War, Jackson led his men through some great victories. But little did he know that the end was near. Jackson’s final battle took place in Chancellorsville, Virginia. In this battle, Jackson went to fight with almost two times less men than the opposing Union Army.  The Union came into the battle with about 130,000 soldiers, and Jackson brought about 60,000 soldiers to the battle. Jackson already knew that he had the lower hand in this battle. Being that he had the lower hand he decided to join forces with Robert E. Lee to help fight towards victory.","<br />Out of that 60,000 soldiers, Jackson took 28,000 and  engaged in diversionary attacks against Hooker’s exposed flank. Jackson’s attack caused extreme casualties to the Union force. Following the attacks, Hooker was eventually forced to withdraw his soldiers. Hooker’s withdrawal meant victory for the Confederate Army.  The attacks by Jackson lasted until sunset. Following the end of the conflict, Jackson took some of his men to the forest to scout for approaching Union forces. Because it was night time, a North Carolina regiment mistook the Confederate Army for Union troops and opened fire. After realising that they weren’t Union soldiers, they ceased fire only to find that they had wounded Jackson. Jackson later died because the wounds were too severe for him to survive. Jackson went on to be known as one of the most notorious leaders during the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 16, 1917 - April 18, 1917","search_date":"1917-04-17","locations":[{"id":53067,"lat":38.3084627,"lng":-77.6344334,"zoom":8,"place":"Chancellorsville, Virginia"},{"id":52766,"lat":37.4315734,"lng":-78.6568942,"zoom":8,"place":"Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2930,"tag":"Virginia"},{"id":2676,"tag":"Stonewall"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":3347,"tag":"1861"},{"id":3348,"tag":"Thomas Jackson"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6718,"title":"Green Grass, Dark Nights","course_id":171,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"1/1/48","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            One morning while playing on the woodpile, five year old Charles Grandy was approached by his slaveholder who sternly said to him, “Boy, do you see this grass growing along the side of the fence? Well pull it all up.” Grandy, who was born into slavery, dutifully pulled all of the grass out. Immediately after finishing the task his master assigned to him, Grandy was carried to the fields where the cotton and other crops were growing, and he was instructed to pull out all the grass growing near the crops as well. Due to Grandy’s young age, he was not allowed to use any of the gardening tools, so all of the manual labor the little boy was forced to do was done by hand. From that day forward, Charles Grandy’s days of playing were replaced with the daily task of removing all of the grass and weeds growing near the crops on the plantation. ","            Typically, children born into slavery were not immediately aware that they were enslaved. Often there was a specific moment or event that showed the child that he or she was not free. The average age for children to recognize their servility was in between the ages of six and ten. It is possible that when Grandy’s master told him to pull out the grass, Grandy realized that he was under another person’s control. Prior to being forced to work, Grandy would play around the big plantation house during the day. Occasionally he would be asked to do small errands; however, one may conclude that he did not realize he was doing those small errands due to his enslavement. Grandy’s experience of being forced to pull out grass is representative of the experiences of many other enslaved children who became aware at very young ages that they were owned by another person. ","Charles Grandy shaped and was shaped by history. The experiences that he shared have formed what we know about enslaved children’s struggles. Grandy was robbed of his childhood because he was born into slavery and was forced to do manual labor for his master. The work he was required to do exhausted young Grandy so much that he often would fall asleep on the cold, hard ground before making it back home. If he woke up in the middle of the night, he would stumble around and struggle to find his home in the pitch-black darkness of the night."],"display_date":"January 1, 1947 - January 1, 1948","search_date":"1947-07-02","locations":[{"id":52766,"lat":37.4315734,"lng":-78.6568942,"zoom":6,"place":"Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"},{"id":2930,"tag":"Virginia"},{"id":3362,"tag":"forced labor"},{"id":3363,"tag":"manual labor"},{"id":3364,"tag":"enslaved children"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}}]}
