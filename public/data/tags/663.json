Often, the actions taken by Northern troops led to hostility and bitterness by southerners towards Northern troops because often the soldiers would cause destruction to civilian Property. This hostility appeared in letters written by both sides.","In May of 1861 Federal troops occupied the home of Robert E. Lee in Arlington, Virginia.  Mary Curtis Lee, the Confederate commander’s wife, was denied access to her home, along with all of her servants. In a plea to return to her home, Lee wrote to Union General Sanford.  She states “It never occurred to me Gen’l Sanford that I could be forced to sue for permission to enter my own house that such an outrage as its military occupation to the exclusion of me and my children could ever have been perpetrated by anyone in the whole extent of this country” However, the plea was ultimately denied. This occupation and then restriction of access was common in the South during the American Civil War.  This occupation of captured territory would ultimately end in bloodshed committed, not by soldiers, but by the civilian population.","As tensions began to rise in the South, Northern troops also began to write letters home describing the hostilities. One Northern officer wrote, “ You have no idea Libbie, how bitter these people are in their hatred of Yankees. They hate us all the way through.” This hatred ultimately came as a shock to Northern troops who viewed themselves as Americans. In actuality they could have been a foreign invaders those affected civilians.  Southerners generally viewed property as sacred. This view of property included not only their lands but also slaves and agricultural products.","As the Northern Army pushed deeper into the South, the civilian population grew more hostile. Ultimately the occupation would lead to acts of violence and to the declaration of Northern generals as war criminals. The occupation would leave its mark on southern families not only throughout the civil war and reconstruction but into the present day."],"display_date":"May 30, 1861","search_date":"1861-05-30","locations":[{"id":13632,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ARLINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5239,"title":"A Soldier Gets Sick","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-17","end_date":"1864-05-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lewis E. Parsons wrote many letters during the Civil War to his family in Talladega, Alabama. Parsons talks about many different things in his letters to home. He mainly asks questions about the home front, and he also talks a great deal about how war is an awful thing. He describes many different situations that he and his fellow men have to go through during the time of war. One of the situations or problems that these soldiers had to face was being sick or getting a disease. Sickness was a very serious problem that many soldiers had to deal with while they were off at war. Parsons does not talk very much about sickness or disease, but he does make one reference to sickness in a letter that he wrote on May 17. He says “I am still having chills and am very weak.” Many soldiers had these same symptoms or feelings that Parsons had. These chills that Parsons takes note of could probably be the symptoms of typhoid fever. The men in the camps started calling the sickness “camp fever”. Many soldiers got sick during the war because of the camps that they had to stay in all the time.","            The camps were very unsanitary, and disease was all around the men because of these unsanitary conditions. Historian Thomas Cutrer wrote about some letters from a Confederate soldier to his wife. The soldier’s name was William Moxley, and he served in the Eighteenth Alabama Infantry during the war. Cutrer tells of how Moxley wrote a lot about the sickness of the soldiers and diseases that they had. The soldiers “never acquired the immunities necessary to fight off even the most common of childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and scarlet fever.” So when the soldiers had to leave their homes to go live in these unsanitary camps they contracted many different diseases. Cutrer also says that a “great interest and value in the Moxley letters is their wealth of commentary concerning the epidemics of disease that shattered both Southern armies and Southern home communities.” These diseases wiped out a huge percentage of both armies during the war. The main disease that was “especially deadly was typhoid.” There were many other diseases and infections that went through these soldiers, but typhoid fever killed the most number of men.","            Another historian by the name of James Pate writes about the letters of the Francis brothers who were soldiers in the Civil War. Pate says that “health issues were a major subject, and outbreaks of measles, mumps, and typhoid fever were routinely reported.” So, Lewis Parsons was not the only soldier sitting in his camp with chills and a feeling of weakness. Every other soldier in that same camp with Parsons probably had some type of sickness or disease. Parsons probably had one of the diseases mentioned above. He did not say in his letter how bad he was feeling, but the sentence he writes does let the reader know that Parsons was sick or on the verge of getting sick. It could have been one of the deadly diseases that were rampaging through both armies."],"display_date":"May 17, 1864","search_date":"1864-05-17","locations":[{"id":13598,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":6241,"title":"Seven Days Battle Letter Gives Insight into Soldier’s Lives","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-07-03","end_date":"1862-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter from R. Emmett Martin to his wife, one can see the content, yet suffering state of mind that most Confederate soldiers were in during the days following the Seven Days Battle. Soldiers wanted to be cheerful as they had just won a battle, but were seemingly unable to muster that emotion because of the losses they endured. The Seven Days Battle was technically a Confederate victory. However, historians wonder if it should be considered a victory at all, as the South suffered immense losses.  Martin demonstrated how distressed many southern soldiers were from the deaths and wounds of comrades and the prolonged time and distance between themselves and their loved ones. Other than the effects of the Seven Days Battle on the Confederacy, it also becomes obvious in this letter how poorly educated some of the soldiers were who were fighting in the Civil War.","James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom,</em> has discussed how devastating the Seven Days Battle was to the southern troops. McPherson reports that the Confederate’s “total causalities in these six contests exceeded Union casualties by 20,000 men.” R. Emmett Martin emphasized this reality as he named off several soldiers he knew who fell that day. Martin summarized that “Our regiment lost in killed and wounded one hundred and twenty six [men].” It is questionable how southerners were supposed to consider this battle a victory when they had lost so much.","The importance of family is also emphasized in Martin’s letter. These soldiers had lives and families waiting for them to return home. Martin showed how important his family was to him as he began his letter: “I write in a haste and only a few lines to inform you of my safety after the hard fought Battle…” Martin spent his spare moments on writing letters to reassure his family that he was still alive. At the end of the letter, he also promises to write again, and in more detail, when he had more time.","Lastly, R. Emmett Martin’s letter shows a stereotypical southern Civil War soldier. It seems as though Martin could not have gone more than a few lines in his letter without a spelling error. For example, “I was in with the regimant,” and “it was an awfull hot place.” These spelling errors also could have been due to other factors such as hurrying to write. However, Frank E. Smitha, a lifelong researcher of history and philosophy, explains that southerners overall were in fact poorly educated during this time compared to their northern counterparts. He states that “Of the nation's 321 public high schools only 30 were in the South.”","Overall, the letter from R. Emmett Martin reiterated many ideas from McPherson, and brought plenty of new ideas to the table as well."],"display_date":"July 3, 1862","search_date":"1862-07-03","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"},{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":2229,"tag":"Soldier's letter"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}}]}
