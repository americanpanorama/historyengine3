General Daniel E. Sickles, commanding the Third Corps, had moved his men off higher ground, which included Little Round Top, and created a line running from the Peach Orchard to Devil's Den. This placed the Union left flank open for an attack. Chief Engineer General Gouvernur K. Warren atop Little Round Top spotted Confederates forming for an attack on his position. He sent word of this attack and Sykes' Fifth Corps was notified. Colonel Strong Vincent's 3rd Brigade of Sykes' Core moved his men into position on Little Round Top and anticipated a Confederate attack.","            Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commanding the 20th Maine Regiment, commanded the extreme left of Little Round Top. The regiment was consequently   at the very end of the Union line at Gettysburg and Chamberlain was ordered to hold his ground at all costs.  ","            Upon reaching his position, the 20th Maine became engaged with Confederate forces who were trying to flank the Union position at Little Round Top. Seeing that the enemy, comprised of the 47th and 15th Alabama regiments, was a threat to the left of his line, Chamberlain ordered sharpshooters from his regiment to move to this vulnerable position that threatened his flank. Confederate attacks (mounted from Big Round Top) were driven off with high casualties. Chamberlain, in a after action battle report, stated, \"We opened a brisk fire at close range, which was so sudden and effective that they soon fell back among the rocks and low trees in the valley, only to burst forth again with a shout…\" This renewed attack failed as \"the terrible effectiveness of our fire compelled them to break and take shelter.\"  Continued attacks were driven back and fighting became brutal as Confederates made it close to Chamberlain's line. Hand- to- hand fighting resulted as the 20th Maine's line thinned but Confederates forces were still unable to break through.","            As ammunition ran out, Chamberlain was forced to order a bayonet charge against the advancing enemy. This attack, directed at the slope of Big Round Top, was effective and Chamberlain captured four hundred prisoners. \"The effect of the charge was surprising; many of the enemy's first line threw down their weapons and surrendered.\" The rebels who were not captured fell back and Little Round Top was not attacked again.  Colonel Chamberlain is remembered for his bayonet attack that secured the Union's victory at Little Round Top. As a result of their failures on the second day at the Battle of Gettysburg, General Robert E. Lee decided to attack the Union center; an attack that was doomed to fail.

At Gettysburg, the 20th Maine and other Union troops took both Little Round Top and Big Round Top. They have become immortalized through the accounts of Joshua Chamberlain.","Writers and scholars alike have found the narrative style of Chamberlain’s after action report to be both unique and captivating. It was his own artful and inspirational portrayal of the battle that brought Joshua Chamberlain fame as America’s Gettysburg hero.","In his report, what Chamberlain did not disclose is as important, if not more, than what he did. The report of Joshua Chamberlain found in the Official Records, dated July 6th, 1863, was actually recreated from memory in 1884 because government editors lost the original. Combined with the the discrepancies of his report and the reports of other participants in the battle, Chamberlain’s accuracy and role in the victory on Little Round Top comes into question.","In Chamberlain’s report, the Union regiments initially opened fire at close range and pushed the Confederates into taking shelter. Soon after, a final assault by the Confederate forces came. All seemed lost for the 20th regiment on Little Round Top as their ammunition depleted, until a rash call by Chamberlain for the bayonet and hand-to-hand combat took the Confederates by surprise.  Chamberlain claimed, “the effect was surprising; many of the enemy’s first line threw down their arms and surrendered.”","In the view of the soldiers of the 20th Maine, many agreed that their attack with the bayonets was the result of their pent up frustrations in the battle. According to their accounts, Chamberlain never said “charge”, as he later claimed, he only called that they fix the bayonet and prepare for a charge.","At the time of this charge, Confederate Colonel Calvin Oates had begun to withdraw Confederate troops seeing the ineffectiveness of their rally for Little Round Top. Along with the move by Oates and Colonel Michael Bulger to disperse and detach Confederate troops prior to the battle, Chamberlain faced depleted Confederate forces that were much smaller than he would later claim.","Later in life, Joshua Chamberlain sought to defend his legacy and story against the contradictory reports of the battle. In particular, both Colonel Oates and Colonel Elias Spear challenged his presentation of the battle.  Chamberlain’s unwillingness to admit the true efforts of Oates’ troops and their thrusts on the crest of Vincent’s spur, led to the denial of a battlefield monument for Oates’ 15th Alabama regiment. Despite the discrepancies to his reports, Joshua Chamberlain has maintained his role as the Hero of Little Round Top at Gettysburg."],"display_date":"July 2, 1863 - July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":103,"tag":"Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain"},{"id":912,"tag":"Gettysburg"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}}]}
