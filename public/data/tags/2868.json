Historians describe the sixties as a monumental decade in terms of technology, music, fashion, sexual revolution, and youth rebellion; but the Age of Aquarius also marked the beginning of a newfound recognition for Americans with mental disabilities. ","John F. Kennedy was the first president to make improving the lives of handicapped Americans a priority in his administration. He issued a message to Congress in 1963 addressing the dire need to aid and support Americans suffering from mental illness. He stated, “…as Americans, it is our duty to seek out the causes of mental illness, strengthen public awareness of intellectual disabilities and create programs and facilities to assist the mentally ill.” This message marked the beginning of a revolution for Americans with intellectual disabilities. ","Kennedy’s sister, Rosemary, who suffered from intellectual disabilities herself, influenced him during his presidency. Witnessing firsthand the heartbreaking tribulations of growing up mentally handicapped, President Kennedy, along with his other sister, Eunice, decided to set forth to improve the lives of the intellectually disabled forever.","A short eight months after President Kennedy’s special message to Congress, he signed the Community Mental Health Act. The CMHA provided funding for research centers and facilities in order to combat mental illness and improve the lives of those who suffer from it. Up until October of 1963, there had never been a law or act aiming to serve the mentally disabled; instead, families kept disabled children at home because society considered them a burden to society. To this day, the signing of this act signifies the official change in government perspective towards Americans living with intellectual handicaps. ","Although President Kennedy died less than a month after signing the CMHA, his legacy for helping the intellectually disabled carried on. Thanks to her brother’s public awareness, Eunice Kennedy founded the Special Olympics in 1968. The goal of the Special Olympics was to provide a day filled with events and sports clinics specifically for intellectually disabled children.  The Olympics proved to be so successful that, by 1970, the organization had spread internationally to France and Canada. At Eunice’s press conference in 1970, she reflected on how much support the organization gained in only two years and thanked Americans for their ongoing efforts to raise awareness for the mentally handicapped. ","Since John F. Kennedy’s presidency, the lives of Americans with mental disabilities have improved greatly.  Thanks to the Kennedy family, the intellectually handicapped are treated with extra care and compassion. Although some may argue that this was not the most important initiative of Kennedy’s presidency, his influence absolutely sparked a significant change in the way Americans view people who are disabled. "," "],"display_date":"February 5, 1963 - December 31, 1970","search_date":"1967-01-18","locations":[{"id":52870,"lat":41.8781136,"lng":-87.6297982,"zoom":8,"place":"Chicago, Il"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":2872,"tag":"Special Olympics"},{"id":2871,"tag":"Rosemary Kennedy"},{"id":2870,"tag":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver"},{"id":2869,"tag":"Mental Retardation"},{"id":2868,"tag":"Intellectual Disabilities"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

Because nobody accepted them anyplace.” This sense of not belonging prompted Eunice Kennedy to take action.","The Kennedy family tried to maintain a perfect outward appearance, but secretly one of their children, Rosemary Kennedy, suffered from intellectual disabilities. During this time, society treated people with intellectual disabilities and other mental handicaps as outcasts. In 1946, Rosemary’s father and mother, established the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation in honor of their eldest son who died at war. The foundation aimed to identify the causes of intellectual disabilities and improve the way society handled people with intellectual disabilities. Eunice Kennedy, Rosemary’s sister, took over the foundation in 1957, which initiated her career as an advocate for people with special needs.","But her work as an advocate began before this; according to Victoria Dawson of the Washington Post, upon graduation from Stanford in 1944, Eunice worked helping acclimate American POWs back into society. She also served as coordinator of the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency from 1947 to 1948.","When John F. Kennedy became President in 1961, his sister, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, made it her mission to change how the world treated and perceived intellectual disabilities. The combined efforts of Eunice and John F. Kennedy helped establish a new precedent for legislation regarding intellectual disabilities.","The Kennedys wanted to further honor their sister, Rosemary, which ultimately led to the creation of Special Olympics. In 1962 Eunice Kennedy started a camp in her backyard in Maryland for children with intellectual disabilities because other summer camps would not accept them. This summer camp ultimately developed into the Special Olympics, which is now recognized on a global scale with over 2.5 million children and adults participating from 180 countries. The origins of Special Olympics on an international platform can be traced back to July 1968. At Soldier Field in Chicago, the world witnessed the very first International Special Olympics Games with over 1,000 athletes participating. The Special Olympics’ mission is to create an atmosphere that allows both children and adults to compete in an athletic setting while “giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills and friendship with their families.”  According to Shirli Werner of Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability, when studying how Special Olympics have affected athletes with intellectual disabilities and their families four major themes appeared: athlete identity formation, family quality of life, the impact on siblings, and the impact on community awareness and inclusion.","In the 20 year time frame since the end of the Kennedy administration, 116 acts or amendments providing support for people with intellectual disabilities and their families were put in place. The Kennedys certainly honored their sister and brought intellectual disabilities into the spotlight by changing people's perspectives and encouraging inclusiveness."],"display_date":"1962 - 1968","search_date":"1965-07-02","locations":[{"id":52870,"lat":41.8781136,"lng":-87.6297982,"zoom":8,"place":"Chicago, Il"}],"tags":[{"id":2872,"tag":"Special Olympics"},{"id":3416,"tag":"Eunice Kennedy"},{"id":2868,"tag":"Intellectual Disabilities"}],"course":{"name":"JFK","school":"Marist College","course_id":174,"school_id":77}}]}
