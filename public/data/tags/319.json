The general populations’ recognition of the battles in the west does not compare to their recognition of the battles in the east such as Gettysburg and Harpers Ferry. The reason is that the battles in the east took place in close proximity to some of the larger national newspapers while the battles in the west were not and therefore did not get the same kind of publicity. The battle itself was a very important piece of the Civil War in the west. Shiloh, when looked at closely, can be considered the Gettysburg of the west. If the South had won, it quite possibly could have been the end to the war in the west. “Long after the last gun cooled on the Shiloh field, writers would bitterly argue the nearness of a Confederate victory on April 6.”","In the broad scheme of the battle, most historians would say that the actions of Col. Cyprus Hall and the 14th Illinois Infantry did not mean much. According to his report of the battle one would think differently. In his account of the battle he describes, move-by-move, the chronology of the actions his men took and what they witnessed. Many of Hall’s descriptions of battle fail to give any recognition to the events of the rest of the battle, much less the Civil War. At first, Hall describes many of his actions as if he does not know what is going on around him but rather that he is just awaiting orders: “I ordered my men to lie down, conceal themselves as much as possible, and await orders”. Hall was even forced to cease fire when he was not sure whom he was firing on. It is a popular belief that the brigade commanders were only giving the power to carry out orders. On the contrary, because of the vast landscape of most battlefields and the resulting slow communication, many officers were charged with the responsibility to both carry out orders and to adapt to the events of battle without putting the army at a disadvantage: “General Grant ordered me to advance, feel my way cautiously, and engage the enemy wherever I might find him”. As the report goes on, Hall is able to acknowledge his surrounding much better than before. He was able to regurgitate every other brigade’s position around him and what he believed to be the positions of the enemy soldiers. While he did not have a true grasp on what was happening in the battle as a whole, he did understand his own positioning and the responsibilities that came with it.","It is interesting at the same time to notice that while he did not seem to mention the purpose of the battle or even the Civil War, he did recognize as many killed and wounded soldiers as he could. He mentioned the bravery of many of his Captains saying that they “were all wounded on Sunday morning, while bravely and gallantly leading and encouraging their men.” Col. Hall’s account of the battle was a very personable one, with great attention to detail of his men, not the entire battle."],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":317,"tag":"1862"},{"id":318,"tag":"Shiloh"},{"id":319,"tag":"Pittsburgh Landing"},{"id":320,"tag":"Cyprus Hall"},{"id":321,"tag":"Union Army"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4722,"title":"Shiloh: Col.

The general populations’ recognition of the battles in the west, concentrating on Shiloh in particular, does not equate to their recognition of the battles in the east such as Gettysburg and Harpers Ferry. The reason is that the battles in the east took place in close proximity to some of the larger national newspapers while the battles in the west did not, and therefore did not receive the same publicity . The battle itself was a very important piece of the Civil War in the west. Shiloh, when looked at closely, can be considered the Gettysburg of the west. If the South had won, it quite possibly could have been the end to the war in the west. “Long after the last gun cooled on the Shiloh field, writers would bitterly argue the nearness of a Confederate victory on April 6.”<br /> <br /> Except for the familiar names of Grant, Buell and McClernand, one can barely decipher which battle he or she is reading about. Shiloh is just a normal battle to the men fighting. The importance of the battle was only understood by those leading the war effort. An Ohio native who studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1837, Col. Ralph P. Buckland, 72nd Ohio Infantry, Commanding Fourth Brigade wrote a report his battle accounts from the battle of Pittsburg Landing (the northern name for Shiloh) to higher authority on April 9, 1862. Buckland, like many other Federal commanding officers, did not know the lay of the land of west Tennessee very well, nor did he have any pre-Civil War combat experience or training. He described his first encounter of the battle as if it came out of nowhere. He wrote, “We had marched about 30 to 40 rods when we discovered the enemy, and open fire upon him along the whole line…” Although he seemed to be unsure of his own positioning and the positioning of the enemy, Buckland’s report comes off as very confident and calm. He talks of the successes of his men during the battle writing that “I think I may safely put the number killed by my brigade in that action at 200.”<br /> <br /> Buckland's account of the battle never mentions the broad scheme of the battle or his opinion of the war. It only really talks about the events that are affecting him directly (i.e. the fighting for life and death of he and his men). This lack of opinion can be partly attributed to the intent of the report to be merely a factual account of events and casualties for the use of higher ranked commanding officers. One can also notice Buckland’s feeling of personal responsibility to recognize the dead and wounded in his ranks by describing the extent to which his men, alive, wounded and dead, were brave and fought for their country. Buckland even gives credit to the surgeons working the field for the Federal army saying, “I take the liberty to refer to the important services of Surg. J. B. Rice and the assistant surgeons of the 48th, 17th and 72 Regiments Ohio Volunteers. They labored…taking no sleep for two days and nights.\"<br /> <br /> Following the war, Buckland was elected to the thirty-ninth and fortieth Congresses as a Republican. He later retired from politics, worked as the government directory for Union Pacific Railroad. He died in Fremont, OH in 1892."],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":322,"tag":"Ralph P.
