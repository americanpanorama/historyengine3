In poignant eloquence, Sullivan Ballou described the conflicting forces at the heart of his identity. Though consumed by undying love for his wife, his patriotic devotion drove him forward toward battle—and death.“[M]y love of Country,” he wrote, “comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on… If I do not [return], never forget how much I love you, and as my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it shall whisper your name...But, O Sarah! if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you—in the garish days and darkest nights…always, always….Sarah do not mourn me dead—think I am gone and wait for thee—for we shall meet again…”","Sullivan Ballou was born in rural Rhode Island, in 1829 and was left destitute by his father’s death just four years later. Intelligent, eloquent, and committed to own self-creation, Sullivan struggled to support his family and put himself through school. He attended Brown University and then the National Law School before being admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-four. He was thereafter elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives, serving as clerk and then Speaker of the House. When war erupted, he was among the first to enlist, leaving his nascent political career to more actively serve his beloved country. At Bull Run, while rallying his men forward, he was shot from his horse and mortally wounded. When he died seven days later, his body was exhumed, decapitated, and set aflame by occupying Confederate soldiers.","His belief in self-improvement and personal recreation reflected the Lincolnian ideology of the Republican Party; his every action attests to the convictions of the Victorian Era. Self-worth was tied to public service, a truth reified in Sullivan’s career as a lawyer, politician, and soldier. His patriotism was tied to Victorian ideals of manhood and self-sacrifice—one’s willingness to defend one’s homes and families, to value one’s nation over one’s own personal interests. His final words articulate the “cult of death” that pervaded contemporary thought. To many American colonists, death was the culmination of one’s search for salvation, ending for many in eternal damnation. In the nineteenth century, those beliefs were reevaluated, and new ideas glorified and romanticized the afterlife. This new understanding, intimately binding life and death, prompted the ritualization of burial and mourning. Sullivan’s widow—like many of her generation—never remarried, mourning her martyred husband for the rest of her life. Only in 1917, at the age of eighty-two, did she at last rejoin Sullivan in fulfillment of the words he had written fifty-six years ago."],"display_date":"July 14, 1861","search_date":"1861-07-14","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":724,"tag":"Cult of Death"},{"id":723,"tag":"Victorian Era"},{"id":722,"tag":"Love letter"},{"id":721,"tag":"Rhode Island"},{"id":516,"tag":"Battle of Bull Run"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5095,"title":"<strong>True Love</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-01","end_date":"1863-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the Civil War era of 1863, Harvey Black, a Confederate surgeon to the Army of Northern Virginia, described in a love letter the great affection he had for his wife Mary.  He wrote about their first encounter when he was seventeen and she just eight years old.  Harvey described, “I became so favorably impressed with her fair face and gentle manners that I frequently said to myself that I wished she was older or I younger.”  Examining the seriousness of the age difference in their relationship showed the genuineness of his love for Mary.  He traveled and pursued his education, but he never strayed from reminiscing about his true love.  Upon his return home, Harvey continued his courtship with Mary, and through marriage many years later, Harvey was able to fully express his love for her."," ","In the early nineteenth century, the role of women was limited in the marriage sphere and in love relationships.  The importance of socio-cultural formation was identified according to the established norms of society and gender.  The meaning of marriage had been primarily functional, in a sense that men and women were not necessarily tied together emotionally.  However, in the love story of Harvey and Mary, the shift in the traditional ideals of marriage was seen, and their relationship was based on compassionate love."," ","The retelling of this love story by Harvey in his old age showed the value of their relationship and the powerful feelings of love that time could not erase.  Harvey described in this letter a love tested through their time apart and reiterated their commitment to each other.  Through their years of marriage, Mary and Harvey were connected to each other in deep affection.  He proclaimed, “and how happy the thought that years increase the affection and esteem we have for each other to love and be loved.  May it ever be so, and may I ever be a husband worthy of your warmest affections.”  Harvey’s determination, love, and devotion was never ceasing for Mary.   "],"display_date":"November 1863","search_date":"1863-11-15","locations":[{"id":13797,"lat":38.8383886986,"lng":-77.2747207757,"zoom":9,"place":"FAIRFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":722,"tag":"Love letter"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}}]}
