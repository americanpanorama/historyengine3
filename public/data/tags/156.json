The roundhouse caught fire.  Over one hundred locomotives belonging to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company were destroyed.  It was a wild night.\"  ","            According to historian Eric Foner, the \"Great Strike,\" which led to that \"wild night\" in Pittsburgh, began in Martinsburg, West Virginia on July 16, 1877.  In their book, <em>Constructing the American Past,</em> Elliot Gorn, Randy Roberts and Terry D. Bilhartz wrote that the workers began the strike when the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad \"announced a 10 percent wage cut for all employees,\" the second such cut in eight months and part of a policy for railroads across the country.  The strikers proceeded to shut down all train traffic through Martinsburg and move all the engines into the roundhouse.  Gorn et. al. wrote that the \"incidents begun in Martinsburg were repeated across the county,\" as workers from \"various industries refused to accept low wages.\"","            The conflagration that occurred in the Pittsburgh rail yards was, according to Gorn, the climax of the \"Great Strike.\"  Gorn et. al. wrote that three days after the strike began in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania Railroad managers angered the Pittsburgh workers by ordering \"that all trains running east from Pittsburgh be 'double headers.'  \"Double headers\" are trains with two engines that pull twice as many cars, and cause twice as much work and danger for the workers. Gorn et. al. wrote that once the Railroad workers walked off the job, they were joined by incensed workers from other industries.","            According to Gorn et. al. the state militia was called into Pittsburgh to control the strike, but many of the militia men sympathized with the strikers. One officer, as quoted by Gorn et al. said, \"the sympathy of the people, the sympathy of the troops, my own sympathy, was with the strikers proper.  We all felt that those men were not receiving enough wages.\"  Instead of controlling the strike, Gorn et. al. contended that many of the soldier put down their weapons and \"fraternized with the strikers.\"","            According to Gorn et. al., the clash between the militia and strikers began when 600 militiamen arrived from Philadelphia.  They noted that the small force of Philadelphia militiamen was faced by an angry mob of nearly 6,000 people.  The angry crowd of strikers included women  and children who jeered and threw rocks at the Philadelphia militiamen.  Foner wrote that because of this, the militia \"fired on the crowds that had seized railroad switches, killing twenty people.\"  According to historian Troy Rondinone, after the militia fired into the strikers they retreated into the roundhouse at the train yards. The strikers reacted to the shooting with outrage and in Rondinone's words \"it seemed as though the striking railroad workers had become a massed army.\"  Gorn et. al. described how the strikers armed themselves and attacked the militia men in the roundhouse by setting fire to it.  The strikers then proceeded to burn and in other ways destroy the train yard.  ","According to Gorn et. al., the rioting resulted in the destruction of 2,000 railroad cars and 100 engines.  \"The resulting fires,\" Rondinone wrote, \"could be seen at a distance of seven miles.\"  The incident in Pittsburgh is just one of the many events of 1877 that according to Gorn et.al., showed that a deep chasm divided and would continue to divide the rich and the poor in America.  In her memoirs \"Mother\" Jones blamed the rioting on and the fires on \"hoodlums backed by the business men of Pittsburgh who for a long time had felt that the Railroad Company discriminated against the city on the matter of rates.\"  However Gorn et. al. noted that Jones was a \"socialist known for her militant oratory,\" so it is likely that her beliefs, and the fact that she wrote her memoirs fifty years after the strikes, led her to believe that the strikers were innocent.  Innocent or guilty, according to Gorn et. al., the strikers were involved in the climax of the largest strike America had witnessed up until that point in her history."],"display_date":"July 19, 1877 - July 23, 1877","search_date":"1877-07-21","locations":[{"id":10817,"lat":40.468833638,"lng":-79.9812076782,"zoom":9,"place":"ALLEGHENY, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":156,"tag":"Labor Strike"},{"id":33,"tag":"Labor Union"},{"id":67,"tag":"Militia"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":6263,"title":"The Baltimore Jewish Garment Workers’ Strike of 1892","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-06-01","end_date":"1892-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1890s Baltimore, coats were made in a multi-stage process. First, Lithuanian “cutters” employed by wholesalers of fabric worked in warehouses to form the parts of coats—the sleeves, the collars, and so on. Next, these parts were moved to the sweatshops that teemed in the neighborhood bounded by Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue on the north and south, and Central Avenue and Broadway on the east and west.. There, men operating sewing machines assembled the parts into coats. Finally, women working by hand finished the coats. The owners of these sweatshops, like almost all the sewing machine operators and seamstresses, were Jews from Poland.","Since 1886, the men working the sewing machines and the women finishing the coats had each had their own union, first as part of Terence Powderly’s Knights of Labor, and then beginning in 1891 in the United Garment Workers, affiliated with Samuel Gompers’ American Federation of Labor. In these early days of American labor, disputes among unions were frequent, and the AFL had split off from the Knights only a few years prior in a major schism. And while the Jewish seamstresses and sewing machine operators had switched to the AFL, the Lithuanian cutters remained Knights. Soon after joining up with the AFL (which was far more strident than the Knights), the members of Baltimore’s UGW locals began to circulate their demands. They wanted a ten-hour workday instead of twelve to eighteen. They wanted to be paid every week, instead of whenever their bosses got paid for finished coats. They wanted year-long contracts, instead of ad-hoc employment. And they wanted everyone working in the shops to be a member of the UGW, with a UGW representative coming by regularly to ensure that workplace conditions were suitable.","The employees of the shops discovered that the owners were going to complete their current orders and then lock the union members out. So the UGW (with the assistance of national secretary Henry Reichers) preemptively went on strike on June 30. Approximately one thousand tailors and seamstresses shut down over thirty sweatshops. Within a week, a third of the “sweaters,” as the shop owners were known, had given in and agreed to operate their shops on union terms. In fact, the strike may have been too successful. Days later, the sweaters formed their own union, the Monumental Tailors’ Benevolent Association. The MTBA was advised by (though not yet aligned with) the Knights of Labor, who were staunch competitors against the AFL. The Knights, who were already affiliated with the Lithuanian cutters, pressured the sweaters not to give in to the demands of the Polish Jewish tailors and seamstresses. Now, instead of each sweatshop owner dealing with the union on his own, the Association was dealing with the UGW. The MTBA tried to convince the male tailors, who led the UGW negotiators, to abandon the female seamstresses, but were rebuffed by a strong show of solidarity. Despite this new stumbling block, the UGW and MTBA hammered out the framework of an agreement by early August. Only one problem remained.","The MTBA, on the advice of local Knights leader J. G. Schonfarber, insisted that the restriction of employees to membership in the UGW be changed to membership in any labor organization, including the Knights of Labor. The UGW, frustrated by the turn negotiations had taken, decided that they would go back to dealing with individual employers, which had worked so well just a month earlier. The MTBA responded by formally joining the Knights of Labor as the Monumental Coat Contractors’ Association. It now became clear to most of the seamstresses, tailors, and sweaters (who themselves were not wealthy or powerful men) that their local dispute had been hijacked by the rivalry between two major national unions. They had been better off before the Knights of Labor ever intervened. By October, almost all the striking workers had returned to the shops. The sweaters employed them on the union’s terms, even without a formal agreement between the union and the shops. The strike had ended when the owners decided to come to terms with their fellow Polish Jews rather than maintain the interests of the Lithuanian cutters or participate in the squabble between the AFL and the Knights of Labor."],"display_date":"June 1, 1892 - October 30, 1892","search_date":"1892-08-15","locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":156,"tag":"Labor Strike"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1664,"tag":"Jewish"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}}]}
