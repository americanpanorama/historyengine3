The report, titled “Perversion Cases- Department of Commerce” entails the procedure and process used to dismiss employees who were found to be “sexually perverted”. Once individuals were suspected or alleged to be homosexual, they were investigated thoroughly by their department and this investigation was then followed up by a personal hearing; if both the investigation and personal hearing were to indicate that the individual was in fact homosexual, they were immediately dismissed from their job (forced to resign). Overall, of the twenty-two individuals which were suspected to be homosexual by the Civil Service Commission, only one individual was found to have false charges against them, sixteen individuals had been or were in the process of being dismissed at the time this report was published and four individuals’ cases were pending decision. Individual cases outlining the forced resignation of employees are also described in this report; employees that were found to be homosexual after a thorough investigation and personal hearing were promptly dismissed. One such case describes the dismissal by retirement of an employee who had served the Department of Commerce for thirty-one years.","Throughout the 1950’s, the practice of firing alleged homosexual individuals was gradually becoming more and more widespread; mostly based on the belief that homosexuals and communists possessed common characteristics which included moral corruption and sexual perversion; these traits made them vulnerable and left them psychologically weak, and therefore, a national security threat; according to the likes of the McCarthy administration and other anti-gay commentators of the time. The instance outlined in the Department of Commerce report is one of many that resulted from what Andrea Friedman calls “the sexualisation of cold war politics” in her article on the manipulation of homosexuality as a political tactic during Joe McCarthy’s term as a senator. The crackdown on homosexual people, according to Friedman, was a result of growing sentiment to differentiate the loyal from the disloyal in which private relationships which were considered inappropriate and abnormal became synonymous with symbols of disloyalty and national betrayal. The use of this political tactic known as the “Lavender Scare” alongside the anti-communist sentiments of what is known as the “Red Scare” portrays the idea that both homosexuality and communism were closely linked in the minds of those who sought to perpetuate misconceptions for their political motivations in the unsure times of the Cold War. "," "," "],"display_date":"1950 - 1969","search_date":"1960-01-01","locations":[{"id":53040,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"USA"}],"tags":[{"id":3289,"tag":"Mass Firings"},{"id":3288,"tag":"Persecution"},{"id":584,"tag":"gay"},{"id":3287,"tag":"Lesbian"},{"id":3284,"tag":"Lavender Scare"},{"id":3286,"tag":"Mccarthyism"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":265,"tag":"america"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}},{"id":6884,"title":"The Legend and Lesbian Visibility Movement created by Dyke TV","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/93","end_date":"1/31/03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Now is the perfect time to join Dyke TV’s membership roster and join hundreds of lesbians around the country who are making Dyke TV happen”.2 The original Dyke TV subscription letter from 1994 was sent out by the station’s creators: Ana Maria Simo, Linda Chapman and Mary Patierno. These three women fought against the mass media in order to portray real-life lesbians on television, instead of the stereotyped version of lumberjack women who lusted after white married women. Through Dyke TV, they were able to do segments on various aspects of lesbian life, such as: Lesbian Health, Workplace, Street Squad’s “Dyke on the Street”, and I Was a Lesbian Child, where adult women would narrate their childhood photos to the audience. As these segments made their way into the homes of thousands of Americans across the country, they played a massive role in opening the virgin eyes of some to the idea that it was acceptable to be a lesbian. Dyke TV reminded some that they had the right to not only be tolerated, but to be accepted, respected and loved, no matter their sexuality.  ","Dyke TV played an integral part in the lesbian visibility movement. “The political moment of identity politics is over. Now it is time for people to come together”.1 The main purpose of creating Dyke TV was not to create an institution, but a single political movement that lesbians and other individuals could get behind who had been previously left out of alternative movements. Though the lesbians remained in their positions fighting for the rights of others, they also demanded their own political liberation, sexual liberation and liberation in all forms for themselves.  ","While Dyke TV ended airing its shows in 2003, it had lived up to its goal and motto, “to incite, provoke and organize”.2 Dyke TV assisted in the organization and operation of multiple protest marches about the lack of lesbian rights in America. They marched in New York City, Washington D.C., London, Germany, San Francisco, and Seattle. Because of Dyke TV, many lesbians who felt that they did not belong to or in a movement finally had a voice that was heard by the public and gained support by other movements, eventually leading the way to the creation of the LGBTQ+ political movement and group that lives today.  "],"display_date":"June 1993 - January 1903","search_date":"1948-04-01","locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"}],"tags":[{"id":3287,"tag":"Lesbian"},{"id":3691,"tag":"Dyke TV"},{"id":3692,"tag":"LGBTQ+"},{"id":3693,"tag":"Lesbian Visibility"},{"id":3694,"tag":"Lesbian Movement"},{"id":3695,"tag":"New York Marches"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}}]}
