Cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and wheat were cultivated on large plantations that saw tremendous profits. A large amount of cheap labor was essential to producing these profits. This cheap labor came in the form of slavery, and it allowed an immense amount of work to be done without costing too much. Without slavery this rapid economic expansion would not have been possible. There is no doubt that slavery was cruel and evil, but was it a necessary evil?","Initially, when Britain arrived in the Americas a plantation system was utilized. Their mercantilist ideas caused the people in the Americas to produce as much as possible in order to achieve the greatest wealth. This system utilized cheap slave labor to tend the large amount of crops on these plantations. However, this labor was cruel and unusual, and was one of the most debated issues within American society for three centuries. The conditions slaves had to endure were unjustifiable. Slaves lived in shacks, ate small amounts of food, were constantly separated from family members, and were beaten with any act of misconduct. Disease, malnutrition, sickness, injuries, and death were prevalent throughout most of the slave accommodations. There was a constant push for the abolition of slavery because it contradicted the ‘”all men are created equal” idea implemented in American society. “It is most certain that all Men, as they are the Sons of Adam, are; and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life.”[1] This came from a publication in a Boston journal in 1700. The article expressed the wrongs of the slave trade by referring to the specific selling of a slave named Joseph. “There is no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and liberty.”<sup>1</sup> The journal expressed this exchange as a lack of humanity towards Joseph. If humans were bought with money then they were not humans at all. The article produces a vivid argument for the contradicting idea of slavery. Americans expressed equal rights for all humans, but treated slaves with little humanity and respect.","Consequently, it is obvious and definite that slavery was cruel, sacrilegious, barbaric, and absolutely unjustifiable. But was it necessary for the progress of the Americas? During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Americas saw a gigantic increase in production and therefore profitability. This increase in production was only possible because of the immense amount of cheap labor supplied by slavery and the slave trade. “Slavery was overall very beneficial for Southerners. After 1830 cotton was booming and it became extremely profitable for a southerner to have a slave.”[2] The Americas had two established cash crops, cotton and tobacco. Both of these crops were labor intensive and required a great deal of manual work. It is apparent that the most cost effective way to utilize these cash crops would be to somehow implement large groups of cheap laborers. With this in mind; it is obvious the best economical solution would have been to use slavery. For this reason, slavery was necessary for the economic progression America saw in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.","In summation, no matter how necessary slavery was to the economic progression of the Americas it does not justify it in any way. But I can understand the thought process of the people at the time. Utilizing slavery was the best possible solution for cheap labor and directly contributed to the wealthy nation we are today. Slavery was evil, but also the most economically beneficial form of production during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."," ","[1] Green, Bartholomew . \"The Selling of Joseph .\" Ames. Cas.

He was finishing his late night rounds for the evening, anxious to get home to his family. He was heading down a road to look for any suspicious activity when there was a ruslting in the bushes along the side of the road. He froze and looked over, and saw someone dart out into the road. It was a teenager, around eleven years old. He looked around skittishly, before running to the cop. It took the cop one look to see the black skin of the boy. He grabbed his hand roughly. “What certificate do you have?” the cop shouted, brandishing a pistol. The slave boy, John Joseph, was lead back to his master. ","The story of a slave who was taking back after attempting to escape is all too common in the south. Since the start of the trade, slaves have always looked for escape. Most that did manage to get away found their ways to the Mississippi River. The river, with the steam boats that moved up and down with traded goods, were often open to the idea of hiring on dark skins for the helpful work around the boat, such as deckhands, riggers, table setters, and most commonly, in the furnace rooms for the large steam engines. 'The thousands of blacks who arrived in New Orleans...thus a crucial nexus of the Atlantic world' (16, <em>Black Life on the Mississippi</em>). John had not reached freedom, despite his murmerous sells till he was discovered by a british team on a boat in the Mississippi. They heard his woes, and carried him out to London. ","Slaves that didn't get to a safety port were often dragged back to their old owners and lashed. The lashing left tell tale scars along their backs, which could impact the resale value. Slavers who were in the market for another batch would inspect each slave carefully for any obvious signs of disease, illness, weakness, or scars. Diseased slaves were good as dead, and a weak armed slave could do little for the tasks in the fields of cotton. Scars along the back are similar, to the slavers, as scratches along a car. It shows that either the previous owner was a poor one, or that the slave was disobedient and didn't work or tried to escape. John Joseph had scars, and this would have decreased his value in the markets. John was whipped numerous times under his first owner's thumb. The standard practice at that farm was to whip the slaves, and then see how much they could bring of the harvest. This amount would then be their expected harvest. John attempted escape, as depicted in the story, and when he was brought back, he recieved thirty lashes and was doused in salt water. The scars detailed an escape event, a stiuation where he tried to flee, and it impacted his pay. "],"display_date":"January 1, 1820 - August 8, 1843","search_date":"1831-10-20","locations":[{"id":52763,"lat":29.9510658,"lng":-90.0715323,"zoom":8,"place":"New Orleans, Louisina"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":500,"tag":"trade"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6404,"title":"Coming South: A Confederate Sympathizer in a Northern State","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-14","end_date":"1860-12-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Just days before South Carolina seceded from the United States in December of 1860, an article titled “Coming South” was printed in a South Carolina newspaper, the <em>Abbeville Press.</em> The article included a letter written by a Northern Gentleman who wanted to support Southerner’s interests in rebelling against the abolitionist North. He believed that the South had been tolerant of the North’s tyranny for too long, and that the Southern states should rebel against the Union. The letter was originally addressed to a large commercial house in Mobile, Alabama, and it discussed the mounting political tensions at the time of publication between the Northern abolitionist states and the Southern pro-slavery states. The author of the letter stated that he was always a believer in the “divine and legal right of slavery,” and in state’s right of secession, and his beliefs made him an outlier in the North. Because secession seemed likely, the author wanted to express his support for the state’s right to secede, and for his desire to conduct business with or even migrate to the South in the event of secession. The author had accumulated land and wealth, and also produced goods that were exclusive to northern states, which would be valuable to the cotton states. The author claimed that if the Southern Confederacy was created as its own union, his first priority would have been to defend that right to secede, and his second would have been to help establish trade between the Confederacy and Europe, both of which would have been essential to fostering the Confederacy’s independence. The author chose to side with the South, because he believed fundamentally in the right to own slaves, to trade freely, and to secede if these rights were infringed upon.","In the letter presented in “Coming South,” the author addressed the issue of secession in terms of it being the only means to protect the interests of the South. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War,</em> historian Bruce Levine discussed how Southerners believed that their position in the United States was untenable, and how the fear of abolition lead to secession (226). The letter author reflected the dominant ideology of the South at the time, because Southerners felt that in order to protect their economic interests and their existing lifestyle, it was necessary to remove themselves from a union that sought to eradicate slavery. Levine notes that antislavery sentiment had “demonstrably taken hold of a huge portion of the northern population” and that this instilled fear in the South, but the Northern letter author interestingly contrasted the dominant view of his region (233). The letter author's position as a wealthy gentelmen suggests that his interest in engaging with the South stemmed from economic concerns. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free, </em>Levine described instances of Northerners who sought to reconcile with Southern planters for the sake of economic gain, and stated that those who sided with the South were usually “key sections of the economic elite who feared alienating the slave owners more than they disliked slavery” (229). Essentially, in some instances businessmen, like the letter author, were more concerned with profiting from the Southern agricultural giants than they were with the moral aims of abolition. In \"Coming South,\" the <em>A</em><em>bbeville Press </em>used the letter to<em> </em>further the newspaper’s own pro-slavery and pro-secession agenda, by highlighting the possibility of economic and moral supprot from wealthy men in the North. The article did not give a name, location, or any identifying information about the letter’s author, so the letter could even have been a fabricated piece of propaganda, intended to encourage readers to side with secession. Southerner’s feared oppression from the majority of the North, but the existence of a pro-secession minority in the North would give Southerner’s reason to believe that they would be supported and successful if they removed themselves from the Union. Overall, the letter transcribed in “Coming South” is significant to period leading up to secession and the Civil War, because it reflected the contrast between Northern and Southern interests, and foreshadowed the eventual secession of the Southern slave states.  "," "," "],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":52809,"lat":30.6953657,"lng":-88.0398912,"zoom":8,"place":"Mobile Alabama"},{"id":52808,"lat":34.1781719,"lng":-82.3790147,"zoom":8,"place":"Abbeville South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":500,"tag":"trade"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}}]}
