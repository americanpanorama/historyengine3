receiving a petition by Baton Rouge citizens, the local government established a colored church and hired a black Methodist preacher, George Menard, to lead the church.  Besides encouraging this and other black churches, townsmen even permitted blacks to attend white churches.  Although the Black Code in Baton Rouge seemed to impress a harsh code of conduct, the authorities rarely enforced these statutes.  Instead, there was more trust in this community, leading to a more peaceful region.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One example of the different attitude Baton Rouge and Louisiana held toward slavery is found in newspapers.  Consistently, the New Orleans Times-Picayune presented favorable articles about blacks and slaves.  For instance, in covering the funeral of a former Savannah mayor, it reported more on the heartwarming response of slaves to his death than on the white response, or even the funeral itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historians recognize that this unique system was due to a variety of factors.  The multiracial Creole society and the strong Catholic influences in Louisiana explain part of it.  However, Baton Rouge also had a different sort of community.  Because it was not a plantation area, slaves were more likely to belong in small numbers to individual families than to reside in large numbers.  Maybe due to this, unlike many Southern areas, the white leaders of Baton Rouge did not fear the spread of antislavery sentiments through black churches, perhaps considering their own influence to be stronger."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":5503,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":26,"title":"State vs. Oscar decided\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the decades before the Civil War, Louisiana began using special tribunals to try slaves accused of violent crimes.  State vs. Oscar is just one example of a case using such a tribunal, where Oscar, a slave, was on trial for the rape of a young white girl.  Oscar was tried in a regular court, but his appeal went to a special tribunal.  The tribunal upheld his guilty verdict, and he was subsequently executed.  The tribunals were often fraught with errors and allowed prejudices to easily influence verdicts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Louisiana tribunals were indicative of increasingly harsh treatment of slaves by the law.  Vigilance committees became common as groups of citizens banded together to investigate and observe the actions of blacks.  Though some government officials, such as Governor Wise of Virginia, tried to prevent such groups, it was to no avail.  Meanwhile, citizens pressured police authorities to enact stronger rules.  In South Carolina, the Lancaster Ledger reported a new ordinance that it shall be the duty of all patrols to whip all slaves, who shall be found with improper permits'.  A policeman's duty now included inflicting violent punishment.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the wake of Nat Turner's rebellion, whites' suspicions and fears were not entirely unfounded.  In Kentucky, a young Negro girl poisoned her master's family with arsenic under the promptings of her neighbor slaves.  With such instances as these, it is not surprising that communities responded.

Generating the overwhelming majority of the party's votes, blacks became the majority of the electorate in Southern states, such as South Carolina, Louisiana, and Mississippi. As the black support increased, it was clear that policies and enactments had to be geared towards the large freedmen population. To maintain control and influence, Republicans mobilized black voters by emphasizing their party's commitment and promise for black rights and interests.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Mississippi, where the freedmen constituted a majority of almost six to five in the state's electorate, the newly enfranchised blacks would open the doors for Republican rule. In 1868, the Republicans constructed a new constitution; in 1869, they won the elections to fill the offices created under it; and by 1870, the first Republican administration of Mississippi took office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1873, the Republican Party continued to control Mississippi. In that year, Adelbert Ames, Mississippi's best-known carpetbagger became the second Republican governor of Mississippi. Under his administration, Republican state legislators were able to pass an important Civil Rights Bill that stated all citizens of this State, without distinction of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, are entitled to the equal and impartial enjoyment of any accommodation, advantage, facility, or privilege;and is hereby declared to have always been, is now, and shall forever remain a right, inherent in every citizen or person, and which right shall not be denied, abridged or infringed;' Subsequently, any person that went against this bill was to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. As a result of enactments such as this, black voters responded exactly as Republican leaders hoped. Unsurprisingly, colored turnout for Republican candidates increased dramatically in Mississippi. In a negative regard, the deliberate painting of the Republican Party as the party of the blacks also encouraged Democrats throughout the South to run as the party of white supremacy."],"display_date":"February 27, 1873","search_date":"1873-02-27","locations":[{"id":7060,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":38,"title":"Alabama Legislature Introduces a Civil Rights Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-02-20","end_date":"1873-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As acquiring civil rights became a political mark indicating the party's commitment to its black supporters, the passage of these measures demonstrated the shift of priority and power that was occurring within the Republican Party. Indeed, the black constituency in the South greatly influenced and led legislation. Needing to consolidate the crucial black vote, Republican legislators pressed for additional civil rights guarantees. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On February 20, 1873, The Weekly Clarion reported that a civil rights bill was proposed in the Alabama Legislature that decided to give to all races and colors equal civil rights in the schools, theaters, hotels, railroads, churches, cemeteries, etc.; and to punish violations by fine of from 500 5000, and imprisonment not exceeding five years;' This was an important effort by the Alabama Republican Party to gain political control as well as reassure and strengthen the necessary black constituency within the state. This bill, however, would pass in the Senate and would fail narrowly in the House. In fact, the bill failed in the House mainly because the opposition of the Democratic-Conservatives prevented the introduction of amendments that would have moderated the terms of the bill. Accordingly, Republicans in white districts opposed the seemingly extreme form of the bill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there remained the hope that the Republican Party in Alabama would stay strong, the influence of the Democratic-Conservatives would continue to grow stronger. In the summer of 1873, John Forsyth led a campaign to prove to the Democratic-Conservative leadership that Alabama could be rescued from the Republican Party if attempting to appeal to black voters and white Republicans was abandoned. Instead, those of the Democratic Party called to vigorously petition white voters of southern Alabama. By 1874, the Democrats would indeed gain dominance. Thus, Alabama became the first state to defeat the Republicans with the politics of the color line."],"display_date":"February 20, 1873","search_date":"1873-02-20","locations":[{"id":302,"lat":32.2201632469,"lng":-86.2079113368,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":41,"title":"Supreme Court Overrules Decision in United States vs. A.

These laws were a means of assessing property and establishing voter eligibility. Simply put, these laws made it the responsibility of a Delaware resident to see that his name was on the assessment lists for the county tax and then to see that he paid his taxes. Only if the tax was paid could he qualify to vote. However, if a man was delinquent in paying his tax, then this resulted in the removal of his name from the tax list for one year by the levy of the court. To hinder blacks from voting, legislators employed these tactics so that their taxes could not be paid, therefore disqualifying them their vote. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To disqualify voters, some assessors acted neglectful, conveniently forgetting to enter a name or entering it in the wrong assessment record. Subsequently, when a black property owner went to pay his tax, it was refused on the grounds that the property owner had not been properly assessed. The tax collector then recorded him as delinquent and struck him from voter registration lists. Furthermore, names were often misspelled or recorded wrong. As a result, black property owners were omitted from tax lists. In these instances, the tax collector refused to accept the assessment, believing the receipt to be counterfeit. Thus, most of the black population and even some white Republicans could not vote. As the Democrats retained control of the election machinery and acts such as these were passed, it became very difficult for African-Americans to qualify to vote. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the specific case of United States vs. A, Given, the U.S. Circuit Court  convicted a collector of county taxes last October for the violation of the second section of the enforcement act. Given had disqualified colored voters by throwing their names off the assessment lists as could be done by the Assessment and Collection Laws. Supreme Court Justices Strong and Bradford, however, rendered a decision overruling the motion for arrest of judgment made by the counsel of the defendant on the grounds that the enforcement act of Congress was unconstitutional. This decision, thereby, affirmed the constitutionality of the Assessment and Collection Laws of Delaware."],"display_date":"January 9, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-09","locations":[{"id":1259,"lat":39.5008834932,"lng":-75.568787499,"zoom":9,"place":"NEW CASTLE, Delaware"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":43,"title":"President Ulysses S.

Called the most brilliant inauguration which ever took place in this country' by The Courier-Journal, the speech was witnessed by thousands of spectators who had been attracted to Washington simply for this occasion.  The immense crowd cheered the President as he passed along in his carriage. However, it was reported that his address was not applauded. Though the Courier called the demonstration imposing and brilliant, it seems to have lacked vim and enthusiasm. The President did not appear like a conquering hero;there was something wanting there.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the actual speech, the President addressed issues of utilizing technological advancements, promoting societal harmony, reinforcing the gold standard, reforming Indian policy as well as restoring domestic and international commerce. He also acknowledged the tense civil environment of the nation.  He confirmed that the slaves were free and deserved to be American citizens but also recognized that the black man had not received the civil rights that went along with citizenship.

A large presence of over three hundred delegates attended the convention, a number of which were African-Americans occupying seats in common with white delegates. The delegates, in general, were composed of a variety of distinguished figures representing the pulpit, the legal bar, the merchant business, the agricultural farm, and other interests. There were also women present claiming to be members of the Equal Rights Association. For the most part, the attendants of the convention retained a strong Christian enthusiasm as well as aroused a great hope for the future of the state. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desiring to pursue temperance rather than politics, a strong theme throughout the convention surrounded the idea that the presence of misery and crime within society was directly caused by the consumption of alcohol. Thus, the delegates claimed the duty to promote moral reform of temperance in order to battle the social problem of drinking. Many hoped that pursuing temperance would not only lessen societal crime rates, but would also hopefully unite the racially divided population. Including the remarks of a colored minister who was invited to speak at the Convention, the Sun reported his statements that ;Maryland was the first State in the Union where colored Sons and Daughters of Temperance were welcomed with their white brethren.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the second day of the convention, an association formed calling itself the Maryland State Temperance Alliance.' The body also adopted a Constitution, where the object of the alliance was the prohibition by law of the traffic of alcoholic drinks, and the education of public sentiment to that end. Thus, the alliance hoped to provide and employ ministers and others of the like to preach and lecture, so that all religious, moral and temperance societies may be united in the work of enactment and enforcement of prohibitory legislation. In the end, alliances and active reformers, like those in Maryland, served to further the growing national crusade towards Prohibition."],"display_date":"May 7, 1873 - May 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-05-07","locations":[{"id":5933,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":48,"title":"Black Representation Increases in Federal and State Governments\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-03-04","end_date":"1873-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As Reconstruction progressed, blacks became more assertive and prominent in the southern Republican Party. African-Americans began to flex their political muscles despite common obstacles of white dominance. An example of momentary white repression occurred in South Carolina to black politician Robert B. Elliott, who later took a seat in the House. It is likely that South Carolina would have had an African American Senator represent them through Elliott. However, in the late 1872 election, white carpetbagger, John J. Patterson, bought the U.S. Senate seat through bribery, disgracing, not only Elliott, but also the colored population. Elliott later commented on the peculiar circumstances in the Atlanta Constitution saying the colored men, as you know, are in large majority in the Legislature, and then for them to deliberately sell out by wholesale is a blow;at our integrity, our honestly, our manhood.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, instances like Elliott's did not stop African-Americans from increasingly occupying offices on all levels of government. By 1873, black representation in the newly elected 43rd Congress had grown from five representatives to seven. They included, Richard H. Cain, Robert B. Elliott, Joseph H. Rainey, and Alonzo J. Ransier of South Carolina, Josiah Walls of Florida, James T. Rapier of Alabama, and John R. Lynch of Mississippi. Starting in late 1872 moving into 1873, Republicans increased their black political leadership on the state and local level as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As 1873 began, Republicans controlled the state governments in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Tennessee, Georgia, and Virginia had turned to Democratic control, while in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, and Texas, Republican governors confronted hostile or divided legislatures. The salience of black politicians within the party and the awareness of the need to satisfy and consolidate the significant Republican black constituency were both growing. As the Radical Republican evolved into the party predominately supporting African-Americans, the Democrats were encouraged to run as the party of white supremacy. Hence, all whites were urged and rallied to vote Democratic-Conservative out of loyalty to their race."],"display_date":"March 4, 1873","search_date":"1873-03-04","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":56,"title":"Mississippi House Signs a Social Equality Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-02-05","end_date":"1873-02-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Wednesday, February 5, 1873, the Mississippi House passed a bill forbidding owners of hotels, theaters, or other places of amusement, common carriers, etc., from making any distinction on account of color.

An African American member of the House introduced the bill, and the proposal passed along a virtually strict party line. Along with the black members, many carpetbaggers and scalawags voted for the passing of this bill. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the Weekly Clarion, the Conservatives unsurprisingly voted against this proposition on the grounds that it was an unwarranted interference with private rights, and a dangerous and demoralizing innovation on the customs of society derived from natural and irreversible laws, which cannot be violated without the most disastrous consequences.' For them, the law should have instead reflected the right for proprietors, without regard to race, to determine for themselves who they will accommodate. Just as the Legislature had no ground to decide whom the owners of a farm can employ to cultivate their land nor could they do the same with private businesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the controversial nature of this bill, its capacity to be introduced by an African American House member and passed within the legislative body was reflective of how the increasing number of black political representatives formed working relationships with white politicians and voters in order to succeed in the South during Reconstruction. More than just being elected by a black electoral base, many African American politicians needed cooperation from their white counterparts in order to be successful.

Following the war, the government established the Freedman's Bureau in Kentucky with offices created to aid African-Americans. However, the new agency was not very active in actually supporting the newly freed slaves. In fact, the only real accomplishment of the bureau in favor of the black population was getting back wages paid to blacks that had been promised compensation but had yet to see that pay after the work was completed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the white- dominated legislature did very little to aid their African American population out of poverty and financial hardship. During the summer Democratic State Convention in 1873, the Kentuckian resolutions passed did not even recognize the inequality and economic strife that a large portion of their society faced. Rather, politicians and legislators focused on maintaining state's rights, limiting the power of the general government, keeping a rigid interpretation of the Constitution, amongst other administrative tasks. In time, the Kentucky legislature soon adopted black codes and segregation laws that the United States Supreme Court eventually deemed lawful.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Additionally, only the revenue raised from black taxpayers could be utilized for African American education and school buildings. No federal, state or local administrations made university or professional level education available to black adults as well. The African-Americans in Kentucky were indeed free and no longer slaves.

The new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 eliminated property holding requirements for holding public office, and established total population (including free whites, voteless free blacks and slaves) for the use of apportionment in the state senate, while the state house of representatives was still apportioned by voter population.

His arguments against slavery usually were primarily economic in nature, thus appealing to the self-interests of farmers and small slaveholders that, at the time, were feeling the effects of severe economic depression in the tobacco market.  Clay listed several reasons why slavery was inefficient: it impoverishes soil', slaves weren't as skillful, energetic, or full of self interest' as whites, slaves supposedly produced less and consumed more than freemen, and slavery caused the poor to despise labor by degrading' it, while at the same time turning slaveholders into lazy, idle people.  He also argued that slavery caused national poverty, kept economic development from occurring at the pace that it could have by restricting education, diverting funds into slaves, and discouraging development of skills.&lt;br /&gt;Clay was correct to fear pro-slavery forces in Lexington; he fortified the office of the True American with cannons, rifles, lances, and a keg of gunpowder, and carried weapons with him wherever he went.  The Christian patriot' John G. Fee, who also harbored antislavery sentiments, experienced the threat of violence against Clay in Kentucky himself: About this time, at my suggestion, a petition was sent to Cassius M. Clay, requesting him to come to Lewis County, July 4th, 1846, and make to us an address on the subject of slavery and emancipation. The call was signed by twenty-seven citizens, to be sent to Mr. Clay.  Mr. Clay accepted the invitation, commended highly the courage of the men who had made the call, but sent back the sad intelligence that he must defer the purposed address until his return from the war with Mexico;This stirred the slave power, especially in Mason County, the adjoining county. ","An article appeared in the <em>Maysville Eagle</em>, which in some respects misrepresented the statement of the former, by saying: This is as rank Abolitionism as was ever uttered by Birney or Tappan. No slaveholder is hereafter to receive the votes of these simon-pure liberty men; and they who dare to apologize for the institutions of our country are thus denounced and proscribed, and this is heralded forth as the sentiments of Lewis County.';Mr. Clay, having declined then to come, and the slave power raging, some ten men of the twenty-seven who had signed the call inviting Mr. Clay to come, took back their names; and upon myself, Mr. Clay's correspondent, were gathered the severest anathemas, and threats of violence and of the utter destruction of my house;My friends expected the threatened violence, and a man whom we knew as a friend and one who had opportunity to know the movements of our enemies came three times during the day and entreated that I leave my home or I would certainly be killed.

The race riot occurred in an isolated area in the southwest corner of the state and because of this remote location, it was very difficult for reporters to obtain reliable details. However, as of Friday March 21, at least seven victims had been identified and by Saturday, it was believed that at least twelve were dead. &lt;br /&gt;According to the Birmingham newspaper, Little River County was known for its racial turmoil. The negro population is large and has for a long time proved very troublesome to the whites. Frequent murders have occurred and the fights have been common affairs'. In this particular incident, whites claim that they had discovered a very carefully laid plan among blacks in the area to incite a race war and that individual whites had been identified at potential targets. They believed that as many as twenty-three men were involved in the plot. In response, whites set out to wipe out' all twenty-three of the supposed conspirators. The Birmingham paper reported chaos in the region: white men are collecting in mobs, heavily armed and determined; negroes are fleeing for their lives, and the community is in uproar'. Anyone suspected of involvement that was found was quickly hung from the closest branch. When black citizens learned of the first several deaths, they became panicked and fled the area. Several among the dead reached the Texas state line before being caught by mobs and killed. Surrounding towns, such as Texarkana, Arkansas and New Boston, Texas learned of the uproar when wagons full of fleeing blacks arrived in their towns. &lt;br /&gt;Reporters had trouble gathering details about the incident because of the location but also because citizens were reluctant to share information. The white citizens are very reticent and are apparently not willing to give any news for publication'. A justice of peace was sent into the area from Texas on Saturday March 22 and reported of one of the victims that the deceased came to his death from natural causes, or was frozen to death'', a comment which was taken to be a cruel joke. However, this reaction demonstrates the indifference on the part of Southern officials towards the injustice being done to blacks in the area."],"display_date":"March 18, 1899 - March 22, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-20","locations":[{"id":654,"lat":33.7005137104,"lng":-94.2343382029,"zoom":9,"place":"LITTLE RIVER, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":165,"title":"William Henson sentenced to death.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-04-27","end_date":"1827-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27th, 1827 a verdict was reached in the William Henson case.  The court convicted this free black for forcibly breaking into a house and stealing items of a small value.'  His punishment was death, to be carried out on May 3rd.  This punishment was certainly extreme for such a petty offense, but the court was using what was called the Bloody Act of 1806.  This act as the Raleigh Register explained it said: any person shall break into any dwelling house, shop, warehouse or other outhouse thereto belonging and feloniously take away any money, goods, or chattels of the value of 20 schillings or upwards;shall suffer death without the benefit of clergy'.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henson's skin color certainly did not help his case, but surprisingly the Raleigh Register actually took to the defense of William Henson.  They did not however, come to the obvious conclusion that this act was utilized mainly because of Henson's pigmentation, but instead took it from the fear that any man (particularly white) might be tried under this obscure yet existing law.  People were advocating that although laws needed to exist to curtail crime, they must be equal to the crime.  The Register put it best when it said: Again and again we repeat, let a penitentiary be established'.  People wanted peace, but not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This occurrence shows two strains that mark the South throughout the nineteenth century.  One, that there was a double set of standards for the free black and the white male (even the poorest of whites).  Henson was the sacrificial lamb towards a political movement towards prison reform, not discrimination.  Second, that the entire justice system of the 1800's would undergo drastic changes during this time period from a place of punishment to a place of reform.  It would bring men like de Tocqueville from France to come to the United States and report on this new prison system in 1831.  Therefore, one can see that in many ways 1827 differed from current times but yet it maintained a battle over security vs. freedom that is still being debated to this very day."],"display_date":"April 27, 1827 - May 3, 1827","search_date":"1827-04-30","locations":[{"id":9840,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":168,"title":"African-Americans Try to Improve the Status of Their Race\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1863, black communities began to hold large meetings to discuss the articulation and communication of new attitudes towards African-Americans.

In addition, at this meeting, African-American men in all places, at all times and under all circumstances' were encouraged to stop using the vulgar phrase, nigger,'' because it had become common practice for military officers to address black soldiers as such (Journal, 186).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that African-Americans did attempt to improve the status of their race, the officers did not always respond favorably to these attempts.

The soldier said that he would not stand such language,' especially considering the how respectable the officer was.  The officer responded by hitting the soldier over the head with his gun, which instantly killed him.  The black soldiers then flew to arms' and wounded or killed over one hundred whites.

The article claimed that a portion of the Federal Army was enlisting black soldiers because it would be a great insult and wrong to the South.  However, this article also focuses on the issue of enlisting African-American soldiers into the Confederate Army, which seems to have been met with even greater resistance among Southerners.  The article refers to the Southerners who suggested African-American enlistment into the Confederate Army as traitors' and scoundrels.' (BKW, 5)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article goes into detail about the laws that had been established previously in 1861 regarding the admission of African-Americans into the Army.  The law stated that the Governor of Tennessee was authorized at his discretion to receive into military service of the state all male free persons of color between the ages of fifteen and fifty.' (BKW, 5)  In addition, the law stated that it was the sheriffs' job to collect names of free African-Americans and give the names to the Governor, should he feel the need to begin enlisting them as soldiers.  However, judging by the article, it appears that the law had not been utilized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Union Army had already been allowing for the enlistment of African-American soldiers into the Federal Army.  In early 1864, Union Gen. Grant requested that one of his commanders organize a black corps.  The recruitment for this corps would start in Tennessee, and then move to Alabama and Georgia.  Although an entire black corps was not created until late 1864, many black regiments started coming into existence well before then.  Because the North had begun recruiting black soldiers (and because the Confederate Army was running low on troops), it would only make sense to some Southerners to suggest enlisting free African-Americans in order to put down the Union.'

The radical Republican Congress that dominated Reconstruction enacted the measure.&lt;br /&gt;     The 14th Amendment extended citizenship to blacks, overturning the Dred Scott decision of 1857.  The most important clause of the amendment, Clause 1, dictated that no state could take away the privileges or immunities of citizens, deprive citizens of life, liberty or property without due process, or deny any person equal protection of the laws.  This amendment was passed over President Johnson's veto by the more radical Republican Congress, and was aimed at the southern states which had used black codes and other measures to strip Negroes of their rights.  It was also used to validate the Civil Rights Act of 1866.&lt;br /&gt;     However, Congress' decision to use the language, No State Shall,' instead of giving the Federal Government constructive power to enforce the provisions of the amendment left the door open for continued racial violence in the South.  Though it forbid state action against blacks, it left them at the mercy of private individuals and organizations like the Ku Klux Klan.  The Supreme Court would seize on this opportunity and remove much of the power of the amendment in later years.  In the Civil Rights Cases of 1875, it held that it was the state's responsibility to regulate private action; Congress had no power under the 14th Amendment.

The emigrants hailed mainly from Mississippi and only men and women in good physical condition were permitted to join. Thousands turned out to bid farewell.  As the vessel was departing the port, the emigrants and those on shore reportedly sang I'm Going Back to Africa's Shores.'   Upon their arrival in Liberia, the married men were given 25 acres of land and the unmarried men ten acres with shelter provided by the Liberian government for the first three months of their arrival."],"display_date":"March 18, 1895 - March 19, 1895","search_date":"1895-03-18","locations":[{"id":1635,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":214,"title":"Frederick Law Olmsted Journeys Through Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As the Northern journalist and famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted began his journal through Texas, he wrote, In entering new precincts, the mind instinctively looks for salient incidents to fix its whereabouts and reduce of define its vague anticipations.'

With the backing of Delaware Senator Louis McLane, they presented a petition by the American Colonization Society (ACS) requesting the Senators and Representatives of that State, in Congress, to use their best efforts to facilitate the removal of such free people of color as may desire to emigrate to the colony in Africa, and to ensure to them the protection and patronage of the United States'. &lt;br /&gt;Clarke added some riders to his proposed bill in Congress, another one pertaining specifically to slavery: requesting the President of the United States to call the attention of the British Government to the subject of slaves, the property of citizens of the United States, who make their escape into the British Province of Canada.'  The bill was sent to the Whole House Committee where it would spend a great deal of time being debated and edited but never passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bill was important because it showed the increasing resistance to free blacks in the United States.  The free black was of little use to many Americans North and South because they could not be seen as reliable or hard working as the slave or they might harbinger delusions' of equality.  Irish and German immigrants saw that since blacks no longer constituted free labor they were now competing with these inferiors' for jobs in unskilled labor, which could be seen, in the eyes of the immigrants, as a hindrance to their well being.  The problem was most people did not know exactly what do with them, and where they fit on the social hierarchy but it was certainly not equal to any white man.  Gradual emancipation was becoming a topic of merit, but could they really survive in the land that oppressed them for so long.  To several people, blacks could be free just not here.  Many were so moved they had already serviced a ship, the brig Doris with Captain Matthews for Virginian free blacks willing to embrace this opportunity'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this was not a majority opinion.  Some believed that slavery was serving a good, eradicating their natural savagery' and that a trip to Africa would be unsuitable for these newly civilized' blacks. Therefore, this petition was not completely supported by any one area.  Fear would not really play a role until after Nat Turner's rebellion and free blacks were seen as a catalyst towards revolt.  The main impetus was maintaining social superiority but the plan failed because of wealthy slave owners' hostility in the South to any discussion on the topic.  Though not speaking for the entire South, they were a substantial part of the higher social ladder, and therefore a force to be reckoned with.  Congress feared the backlash from irate plantation owners, infringing on property rights' struck severe Constitutional problems for some Congressmen.  The American Beacon put it this way It was opposed by others as containing principles injurious to a certain description of property and contemplating an immediate emancipation'.

The white Northern press excluded most African American writers, so Wells was forced to create new arguments and tactics.  In an effort to attract attention to the plight of blacks, Wells attacked white fears of declining manliness and blamed those fears as the motivation and perpetration behind lynchings of blacks.    &lt;br /&gt;In 1895, Ida B. Wells released her pamphlet titled A Red Record: Tabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynchings in the U.S. 1892-94.  The pamphlet drew on her rhetoric about declining manliness and described hangings, burnings, and mutilations of blacks, thus revealing the nation's tolerance of cruelty to blacks.  In the pamphlet, Wells claims that it is the white man's civilization and the white man's government which are on trial.'  Through her discourse on manly civilization, Wells showed that white manliness could only be saved and civilization advanced by obliterating lynch law.  The pamphlet and Wells's rhetoric shocked white America and it became quite popular in Northeast cities as well as in Great Britain.  &lt;br /&gt;On April 8, 1895, following the release of Wells's pamphlet, women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony joined Wells at a lecture at the First Baptist Church in Rochester, N.Y.

A young Texan theological student echoed the sentiments of many Americans during the time and rebutted that if Negroes are so badly treated in the South, why do they not come North, or go West, or to some more congenial place?'  Anthony and Wells both retorted that the North treated Negroes no better than the south.

Its students staged Texas's first sit-ins in the 1960s and James Farmer, a 1938 alumnus, was the founder of the Congress On Racial Equality (CORE).&lt;br /&gt;In a larger context, Wiley's founding was just one example of the wave of educational institutions whites established and/or managed specifically for black students in the wake of emancipation to channel the energies of young freed slaves and socialize them in the ways of the white-dominated South.  In many Eastern states, negro' colleges were established with taxpayer-funded state support as part of the emphasis Southern legislators placed on establishing a public educational system which followed the separate-but-equal' philosophy that Plessy v. Ferguson would legalize a few decades later.  The case of Texas, however, was a bit different than that of North Carolina or Tennessee.  The Annual Report of the United States Commissioner of Public Education published in August 1873 identified Texas as the last of the Southern states to act' legislatively to provide for the education of colored children' and young adults.  Religious organizations, such as the black Methodist Episcopal Church in the case of Wiley, stepped in to fill the void, reinforcing the central role churches played in the black community after the war and providing leadership for freed slaves."],"display_date":"January 1, 1873 - January 1, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-01","locations":[{"id":12842,"lat":32.565944688,"lng":-94.3830109697,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRISON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":311,"title":"Miscegenation laws passed prohibiting racial intermarriage\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-07","end_date":"1873-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[":  By 1873, both Virginia and North Carolina had installed conservative, white-dominated state governments, the former having been redeemed' in 1870; that is, white Virginians generally opposed to black rights controlled state government.' (Hartzell 135).  The relative lack of Federal interference in these states' legislative actions and nearly nonexistent Republican influence allowed North Carolina and Virginia to pass anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting persons of different racial background from intermarrying.  The Carolina law forbade marriages of whites to blacks or Indians (to the third generation).  The Virginia statute carried a fine of at least 100.00 and a minimum of one year in jail for whites who married blacks, while the marriage celebrant faced a 200.00 fine.  An added dimension of the Virginia law was the encouragement of informing on fellow whites who might be tempted to perform a mixed marriage: half of the 200.00 fine went to the informer.  &lt;br /&gt;Even in more liberal (and federally controlled) states, the rumblings of a highly anti-miscegenation white population could be heard.  Any report of an interracial affair in the South was quickly passed around the community via informal local communications.  Even recognized news channels like newspapers reported instances of racial mixing in other towns and neighboring states, usually with a disapproving tone.  The Charleston News & Courier described the sensation in Savannah' that occurred when a black woman visited the wife of a white man and insultingly informed her that she (the negress) was the party's wife.'  The black woman claimed she had married the white man a year earlier in neighboring Charleston.  &lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the ideal of sexual segregation that proper white Southerners tried to project and enforce was just as much of an illusion in the so-called New South as it had been in the Old.  By 1873, black and white Southerners had been living among each other for well over 200 years, a closeness which produced the inevitable: interbreeding of the races.  That kind of entrenched sociocultural and sexual interaction is difficult to suppress simply for the sake of an ideal, but the Jim Crow South insisted on at least appearing to abide by sexual segregation laws.  Anti-miscegenation laws continued to be updated and implemented throughout the South until the Civil Rights movement nearly a century later."],"display_date":"July 7, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-07","locations":[{"id":9845,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":312,"title":"Segregated Schools Mandated\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-08-31","end_date":"1873-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the first Confederate state readmitted to the Union on July 23, 1866 Tennessee never experienced Federal military occupation. As a result, Tennessee was able to get through Reconstruction with relatively few changes to its state constitution.  In 1873, a majority-white legislature passed a new public school law mandating separate but equal for black students and teachers, supported by property taxes and, ironically enough, poll taxes.  Despite its siding with the Union in the Civil War, the school segregation laws of West Virginia and Kentucky proved that racism was not limited to the Five Military Districts and Tennessee.  West Virginia's updated segregation law provided that separate black schools should only be opened if the number of black students in the district exceeded 15.  Kentucky followed its southern neighbor's example by making it illegal for a white child to attend a black school, and vice versa, in 1873, just five years after it had barred school segregation.  The following year legislators instituted uniform, federally-funded segregation in the education system.  &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, even some unredeemed' states managed to institute separate schools for the races, as evidenced by an August Atlanta Constitution editorial by Joseph Brown criticizing the Atlanta Board of Education and City Council for refusing to allow a local white woman, who had been teaching in the colored system, to transfer into the white schools.  The latter part of Brown's article offers a notable disclaimer to reiterate directly what I have frequently said; that I am not, and never have been, an advocate of social equality between the races; I have always insisted that the races should have separate schools.'  Undoubtedly, millions of white Southerners shared Brown's opinion, believing black students to be inherently inferior in the academic arena, a dangerous and unpredictable social element unfit to mix with white children, or sexual deviants waiting to ravish young white girls on the way home from school (or all three).  &lt;br /&gt;By 1873, the importance of segregation in public education was already commonly accepted in a majority of white Southern states as necessary for peaceful racial coexistence, even in states (like Georgia) which did not yet have a legislated framework for two parallel educational systems.  The legal entrenchment of separate but equal' schools, first seen in two states outside the Deep South and outside the reach of Federally-protected black equality, laid the groundwork for the later institutionalization of Jim Crow segregation in almost every area of social and educational life throughout the South."],"display_date":"August 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-31","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":316,"title":"Hamburg Massacre\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-07-04","end_date":"1876-07-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 4 a Black militia gathered in Hamburg, South Carolina, a center of Reconstruction and Black power, to celebrate the nation's centennial.  A white farmer arrived on the scene and ordered the militia to move aside for their carriage.  Although the militia eventually opened ranks, the next day the farmer demanded to a state justice that the leader of the militia, Dock Adams, be arrested for obstructing my road.'  Adams chastised the justice for entertaining such a complaint and was charged with contempt of court.  Meanwhile, the Black militia again gathered in Hamburg, but this time there was also a large group of white men.  Adams refused to disarm the armory and hundreds of white reinforcements joined the crowd.  The outnumbered blacks attempted to flee, but 25 men were captured and five were murdered in cold blood.  African American shops and homes were also ransacked.  &lt;br /&gt;In South Carolina, the massacre ended any chance of a union between Governor Chamblerlain's Republican and Democratic supporters, and the reconstruction governor would eventually lose to his Democratic challenger, General Wade Hampton, in the election that November , marking the final triumph of Redemption' in South Carolina.  &lt;br /&gt;On the national scene, Democrats viewed the event as an example of how Republican Reconstructionists should not be in control of the southern states.  They pointed out that most of these deplorable events, similar to the Hamburg Massacre, were occurring in South Carolina, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi, where Republicans still had the political power.  Senator William Andrew Wallace of Pennsylvania said in a speech to Congress in early August 1876: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this, I ask, while in States that are still under control of others than the Democratic party in the South the freedman is discontented and riotous, outrages, blood and murder are heard of, the people are discontented and unhappy, taxation is redoubled, and the only right that a white man has there is the right to be taxed?  Why is it that in all these States material prosperity is lessening, prosperity decreasing?  Why is this?  Can there by any other answer than that in the latter the power, the control, the interference of the Federal Government exists, and men are not permitted to govern themselves as we do in the North, regulating and controlling our domestic affairs in our own way?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, newspapers throughout the South, and especially in South Carolina, blamed the event almost entirely on the Black militia.  The origin of the affray was the insolent behavior of a colored militia company,' wrote The Charleston News and Courier.

Hailing from Nashville, Tennessee, the Jubilee chorus was composed of four men and seven women who sang traditional black spirituals to raise money for Fisk University, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy in the 1860s and 70s.  The majesty of the Singers' harmonies and stately bearing stood in stark contrast to African-American minstrel and burlesque entertainment, such as the Georgia Minstrels, which was also popular in Europe and America at the time.  Advertisements for these types of shows tended to present common white stereotypes of black Americans, including the sexually provocative black female and the Northern black dandy.'

(Edgar 388)  As a result of black Republicans' overwhelming legislative successes (blacks won 255 of the 487 federal and state elections in South Carolina between 1867 and 1876), equal opportunity education was made a top priority.  A government-funded public school system was instituted, albeit with segregated secondary and elementary schools, and the former South Carolina College was re-chartered in 1865 as the University of South Carolina.  Two black trustees were appointed in 1869, and integration of the University began in earnest in the fall of 1873.   In a series of firsts that year, the school hired Richard D. Greener, its first black professor, to teach metaphysics, and subsequently enrolled of then-Secretary of State Henry E. Hayne as the school's first black student.  The school was the only Southern state university open to black students&lt;br /&gt;Integration, however, quickly became a sort of unintended reverse segregation as the last native white professors and students withdrew in protest, leaving only Radical white professors, black professors, and black students at USC.  The lack of a conservative presence earned the school the derisive epithet of Reconstruction University' and School for the Deaf and Blind' among white Carolinians, and white boycotts of the school extended to neighboring states as well. The Atlanta Constitution's educational announcements mentioned nearly every institute of higher education in the South, from Davidson College and the University of Virginia to ladies' finishing schools; nowhere do those ads mention USC and the opportunities it would provide for biracial education.  Meanwhile, editorials in influential papers like the Richmond Dispatch decried any educational funding or policy bill under which negroes shall be admitted upon the same terms as whites' and declaring that, should a Southern state school choose to receive and use federal funding to provide integrated schools, that institution would quickly lose its white patronage.  &lt;br /&gt;USC's brief four-year interlude of integration ended in 1876 with the conservatives' Redemption of South Carolina.  Democrats quickly closed the school in 1877 and reopened it in 1881, again as an all-white institution.  White opposition to integration, especially in higher education, was a powerful force in the postwar South as whites struggled to reestablish their social identity and cultural supremacy in the face of competition from resourceful and capable former slaves.  The University of South Carolina was an anomalous but important experiment which demonstrated that, contrary to contemporary popular opinion, black students could indeed benefit from higher education just as much as white students."],"display_date":"August 1873 - December 1877","search_date":"1875-10-16","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":328,"title":"Fredrick Douglass boards train for freedom\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-09-03","end_date":"1838-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 3, future abolitionist Fredrick Douglass successfully impersonated a sailor and gained access to a train ride toward freedom.  Unlike most slaves, Douglass was literate and could therefore taste the pleasures of freedom. This desire was also augmented by his location in the upper south.  While such a position eased some of the burdens of bondage,' it also increased one's knowledge of potential autonomy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglass's account of his mind state prior to the escape is particularly instructive.  In his narrative he describes the conflicting emotions and pulls to both remain a slave, and attempt escape.  He comments that, like other slaves, his knowledge of geography and the distance of his escape route was largely unknown - slave owners portrayed slave territory as endless.  However, lack of a secure plan and potential danger could not outweigh the appeals of freedom, regardless of its remote possibility.  In reference to his mentality and that of his coconspirators, Douglass writes, I believe there was not one among us who would not rather have been shot down than pass away life in hopeless bondage.'  It is clear that the privilege of education played a role in such an assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future impact of Douglass's escape was pervasive.  A skilled and artful author, the writings of Douglass were able to strike an emotional chord with nearly all those who read them.  Douglass released an influential autobiography in 1845, and soon after founded an abolitionist newspaper, the North Star.'  During the Civil War, he served as an advisor to president Lincoln.  Today, nearly all students of racial history read his powerful accounts.  However, his 1838 escape is an example of an event that remained under the contemporary radar.

The new three-story structure, which cost 23,000 and was funded by taxpayers and the new Kentucky public educational system, also responded to a genuine desire of the black community to provide what the local paper called a sound common school education' for its young students.  White citizens of Louisville, not wanting the state to be behindhand as regards the education of the colored people,' agreed that a new, elegant' facility for black students was necessary, as long as their own children remained housed in whites-only buildings.  The fawning Courier-Journal reported that the new school's trustees were all black, which was unusual, especially for a school with such a large number of students (approximately 300 were enrolled, with maximum capacity at 600 pupils).  Often, whites preferred to have people of their own race supervising black educators in order to ensure that appropriate messages and teaching methods were being used to socialize young blacks to know their place' in the community.&lt;br /&gt;Republican control of Kentucky did little to stop the spread of segregation in the state.  Howard Rabinowitz's essay on the post-war shift from exclusion to segregation, rather than integration, sheds some light on the reasons the Republican party of the 1870s chose not to support integration, yet moved forward from total exclusion.  Segregation became a middle ground which allowed politicians to appease white voters and avoid integration while complying with the letter, though not the spirit, of Federal laws barring exclusion and forcing states to provide equal opportunities for their black citizens.  Some black Southerners unwittingly supported segregated schools as a means of taking care of their own, not realizing the precedent such an institution would set.  Indeed, segregation became the symbol of white supremacy in the American South after the Civil War, replacing the plantation big house' and slave owning Master' of the antebellum period, spreading rapidly from education to transportation to consumption spaces like restaurants, shops, and hotels.  The sheer size and speed of segregation left freedmen essentially powerless to stop legalized Jim Crow laws of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."],"display_date":"October 7, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-07","locations":[{"id":4800,"lat":38.0422598094,"lng":-84.4586978215,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":335,"title":"Black Religious Revival in South Carolina sends congregation to Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-08-05","end_date":"1873-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 8, 1873, a correspondent for the Charleston News & Courier dispatched a report on a mass exodus led by a black preacher-prophet named Bobo, described as the spiritual head and adviser of one of the largest negro congregations in [the] county.'  Bobo's church was located slightly south of Spartanburg, and his followers came from nearly every local plantation to hear him preach.  Toward the end of July, Bobo's significant congregation had gathered for a kind of revival' which by August 5th had culminated in one of the greatest religious demonstrations ever seen in this country.'  Whites thought the preacher's passionate exhortations, urging his flock to sell all their belongings and follow him at the appointed time, were the ravings of a madman; black churchgoers thought he was the new prophet high in favor' who would lead the children of Zion' to the Promised Land, which he claimed was just 160 miles to the east. &lt;br /&gt;During the first week of August, Bobo announced that the command to march had been received,' and as soon as the oldest member of the group was sacrificed, they would leave Spartanburg.  With a show of violence, local whites managed to save the elderly black woman (who was not opposed to the idea) selected as the group's martyr, foiling one part of Bobo's rather bizarre plan.  Undeterred, his followers immediately sold off the majority of their possessions, packed up their children and food in a single wagon, and began their march.  Witnesses interviewed by the News and Courier reported that, On the march several attempts were made to dissuade them from their folly, but without turning to the right or left, with eyes upturned they went on without making any answers. The last heard of them they were crossing the mountains in the direction of Tennessee.'  &lt;br /&gt;Although Bobo's revival and march were not intended to shed white blood, as Turner's did, several elements in this rather peculiar event merit comparison with Nat Turner's 1831 uprising.  Turner's religiously-inspired prophesies and declarations were dubbed insane by whites, who fearing any show of black independence and leadership, did everything they could to discredit him.  Forty-two years later, the same thing happened in South Carolina to Bobo; the paper dubbed him a Negro of gross ignorance; of very loose morals' whose followers were poor deluded creatures.'  Again, white Carolinians seem to have missed the importance of Bobo's flight: he was leading freedmen out of the land of their enslavement, away from their former masters, toward a new life of possibility.  The Biblical analogy of a prophet leading the Israelites away from Egypt signifies the importance of religion to the black community, much as Turner proclaimed himself a prophet in 1831.  It is, of course, entirely possible that the black mystic named Bobo who led sixty fellow freedmen away from Spartanburg was completely insane; regardless, the event is an important indicator of the continuity of the role of religion in Southern black communities and the mistrust which unexpected black action inspired in the white population."],"display_date":"August 5, 1873 - August 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-06","locations":[{"id":11648,"lat":34.9591922676,"lng":-81.9357757115,"zoom":9,"place":"SPARTANBURG, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":337,"title":"Republican vs. Republican for Mississippi Governor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-09-22","end_date":"1873-11-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 25, the Louisville Courier Journal wrote, The most interesting campaign now in progress in any state is on the boards in Mississippi.'  Why?  First, there was no Democratic candidate in a Deep South State, and second, there were two Republicans , one a scalawag, the other a carpetbagger , running for the position.  In August of 1873, Adelbert Ames was nominated for governor of Mississippi by the radical wing of the Republican Party.  As an ardent and vocal supporter of black suffrage and former governor of the Fourth Military District, Ames's ticket also included a number of black candidates.  Blanche K. Bruce was nominated for United States Senator and Alexander K. Davis was nominated for Lieutenant Governor.  Because he was a carpetbagger (born in Maine), conservative whites despised Ames; his base of support instead consisted of black voters and a small group of radical whites.  His opponent, James Alcorn, was the native, moderate Republican candidate.  A Delta planter turned scalawag turned Republican, Alcorn was preferred by the wealthy planter elite, taken up by the hard-pressed Democrats because he was the Administration's brother-in-law.' &lt;br /&gt;The very lively' race had the added intensity of mutual personal dislike between the two men; according to the Courier Journal so eloquently put it, two Tom-cats tied in a tow sack would have been more harmonious.'  Newspapers at the time felt that Alcorn would be the clear winner of the contest: Ames is no match for Alcorn; Ames will be as mushy as clay in the hands of the robust Mississippian.'  Conservatives disparaged the Radical ticket as not respectable; made up of bummers and dead-beats' and unfairly criticized black nominees, particularly Davis, in an attempt to draw votes away from the more progressive Republican wing.  Their efforts were in vain, however, as Ames soundly defeated Alcorn in the November 4 election, installing the Radical party for its last term in Mississippi's government (1874-1876).  Under Radical Republican rule between 1870 and 1876, Mississippi's taxes increased by 1400%, in large part due to the new state-financed public education system (Skates 116), and black Mississippians were able to truly participate at the highest levels of state government."],"display_date":"September 22, 1873 - November 4, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-13","locations":[{"id":7060,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":341,"title":"Ku Klux Klan pardons issued by President Grant in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-31","end_date":"1873-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The South Carolina branch of the Ku Klux Klan was established during the 1868 Presidential campaign.

In a rare show of support for a Republican policy, the Charleston News & Courier praised Grant's decision as highly esteemed; The action of the President does him honor, and time will show that his conduct in the Kuklux matter was as wise as it is generous and just.'  The implications for the freedmen's futures, however, were not so rosy.  The federal government's withdrawal from Klan prosecutions was one of the first inklings of what was to come in 1877, when the government's removal of remaining Federal troops from the South effectively abandoned blacks to Jim Crow.  Grant did manage to destroy the Klan organization in South Carolina, but on a larger scale, his failure to bring violently bigoted whites to justice set the stage for the rise of unabashed racial brutality, especially lynching, during the 1880s and 1890s."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":354,"title":"Lynching to Protect White Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-31","end_date":"1873-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though the exponential increase in lynching did not truly begin until the late 1880s, the upward trend had already begun a decade earlier.  Casual articles with headlines like A Rascal Lynched' were fairly common in the newspapers of the 1870s; already, much of the Southern public was blinded with fear and rage at the idea of a black man with a white woman.  A lynching was most likely to occur in cases where a black man had been convicted of outraging' (raping) a white woman, though a lack of conviction did not mean whites presupposed an accused negro's innocence.  In Cairo, Mississippi, for example, a black man arrested for attempted rape of a white girl was taken from the jailhouse by a number of citizens and hanged.'  Threats of extralegal executions for black men were accepted as almost normal when a white woman's integrity and supposed virginity were at stake; many newspaper accounts failed to even mention the suspect's name.  A one-sentence account in the Richmond Daily Dispatch relayed a Mason County, Kentucky incident: A negro was shot dead in Mason County yesterday for rape.'  &lt;br /&gt;But why did rape merit the death penalty only in cases where the accused was black and the victim was a white woman? The Civil War ripped apart the Southern social structure; white men were no longer the unquestioned masters of their region.  The threat of white-black racial amalgamation coupled with post-slavery black competition in social and economic spheres struck fear into the hearts of white men across the South and compelled them to reassert their power over both their' women and the black men who were their competition. During Reconstruction, scattered incidents of lynching foreshadowed its exponential rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Lynchings in 1873 and those that occurred 2 decades later differed only in their frequency and intensity.  By the last decade of the nineteenth century, lynching had become the ultimate public expression of white male dominance, complete with cameras, newspaper announcements, and special excursion trains chartered for urban whites to view the ritual and extended torture of African-American men and even women in rural areas."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":5125,"lat":38.5951990256,"lng":-83.8240569898,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":358,"title":"Maggie L.

Only in retrospect can it be said that Reconstruction began in 1866, as it was not until March of 1867 that Congress passed the first of the so-called Reconstruction Acts that would truly force change in the South.  President Andrew Johnson attempted to veto all three acts, but each time Congress passed the act despite these objections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On July 19, 1867, the third of the Reconstruction Acts gave supreme power to the five Union generals overseeing Reconstruction in the five districts of the South.  Each district included several former states of the Confederacy, with the exception of Tennessee, which was never under military rule.  These generals held the power to remove any official, elected or otherwise, from office if they believed the official to impede rather than expedite the process of Reconstruction.  Understandably, the North felt that the South would try to avoid the obligations stated under the previous Reconstruction Acts, which included holding a constitutional convention to re-write each state's constitution as well as the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Despite the implicit fact that this law was intended to improve the situation in the South for blacks trying to resettle after emancipation, it was widely resented by Southerners who felt that the North was, yet again, attempting to impose their will on the former Confederacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Congress pushed the Reconstruction Acts through, despite President Johnson's veto, they were likely unaware of the repercussions that would result from these acts.  In the South, white citizens would go to extremes including the formation of the Klu Klux Klan and, sometime later, the writing of Jim Crow' laws in order to keep blacks from gaining power.  Meanwhile, Johnson was impeached by the House of Representatives for attempting to remove members of his cabinet who had supported Reconstruction, even as he vetoed it.

As a result, even though Maryland was not controlled by the mandates of the Reconstruction Acts, the state, which had supported slavery, needed to rework its constitution in the wake of the war's conclusion.  In the August 18 edition of the Baltimore Sun, the editors proudly proclaimed that the convention had drawn to a close and that voting to ratify the new constitution would occur in approximately one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 18, the people of Maryland ratified the constitution, but it did not take effect until October 5 of the same year.

Conversely, Washington convinced much of white America that the industrial education would keep the blacks in a low position.

There were only three dissenting votes against these two measures. The first measure urged Kentucky's statesmen in Washington to endeavor Congress to appropriate money and aid, so far is consistent with the Constitution of the United States, in colonizing the free people of color' in Africa. The second measure stated that Kentucky's Governor should send a copy of the previous resolution to all the States' Governors and Statesmen. Since whites were very suspicious of free blacks and loathed the very idea of coexisting with them, Kentucky's action was very typical of this time period. To solve this problem humanely, many advocated colonization of freed blacks and many colonization societies were founded to promote this idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example of one of these colonization societies was founded in December of 1829 in Nashville, Tennessee. To promote the formation and expansion of colonies of free slaves in Africa, many prominent Nashvillians joined together and formed the Tennessee Colonization Society. Philip Lindsley, head of the University of Nashville, was made president of the society. This event reveals that anti-slavery sentiment had already made its way into the south by 1829 and that prominent citizens were beginning to take a philanthropic view towards slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few people knew what to do with the rising number of free people of color and even fewer people knew what to do about the moral issue of slavery. During this period there was a flourishing of Colonization societies and colonization sentiment because colonization was seen as a humane solution to the free black problem.' In other words, the people of the United States, especially the South, could not imagine a society of peacefully coexisting free blacks and whites, and colonization was seen as a humane way to avoid a race war. Unfortunately, the resettlement and transportation of former slaves to Africa was not only costly but few slaves desired to make the perilous and long journey.

A man who had been well acquainted with Patty Cannon, Jo Johnson, and their gang was soon apprehended and questioned. This individual confessed that the gang had been responsible for the murder of the buried individual, who had allegedly had 35,000 dollars on his person at the time of his murder. The man went on to confess that the gang had also been responsible for other murders. This individual showed authorities the locations of other graves. Soon after, Cannon was arrested and placed in jail. Jo Johnson, Johnson's brother, and the other gang members were never apprehended (Saturday Evening Post)."],"display_date":"March - April 1829","search_date":"1829-03-31","locations":[{"id":1263,"lat":38.5891476507,"lng":-75.2274591863,"zoom":9,"place":"SUSSEX, Delaware"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":418,"title":"Fine for teaching African American to read is raised to 500 in Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-12-22","end_date":"1829-12-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1829, the fine for teaching an African-American (slave or free) was raised to the exorbitant sum of 500. This figure was far higher than in many other states (for example: 100-200 in North Carolina). This law applied to slave and free blacks. Even a father could be fined for teaching his own child to read. This law was influenced by the appearance of David Walker's Appeals to the Colored Citizens of the World (Clayton 81).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Walker's Appeals were published on September 28th, 1829 and many copies soon found their way into the South. This one pamphlet did more to scare white slave holders than any previous literature. Supposedly 50 copies of Walker's Appeals made it to Savannah, Georgia, and this was the event that caused the legislature to create such a stiff fine for teaching slaves to read. This would have been understandable considering what was contained in the Appeals. Walker talked of Slaves rising up like the great Hannibal and mercilessly killing their white oppressors (David Walker Appeals').&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This law revealed how scared Southerners were of a slave rebellion. The threat of a slave rebellion was constant when there were over 300, 000 slaves in some states. Mississippi had only 899 free blacks while they possessed 309,000 slaves. Southerners even talked about the awful prospect of the slave population out growing the white population. The Weekly Gazette and Comet wrote Humanity shudders at even the conception of what must one day be the consequence of the great and increasing disproportion of the white to the slave population of Louisiana.' Slavery laws, such as fines for teaching blacks to read, were designed to keep the African American race inferior to whites and keep the slave situation dependant on a more educated and literate white population. Slave holders figured they could put off the end of slavery by keeping slaves unable to function as free citizens in society"],"display_date":"December 22, 1829","search_date":"1829-12-22","locations":[{"id":1522,"lat":33.0721732643,"lng":-83.2584220033,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":423,"title":"General Sherman Forbids the Entry of Blacks into Army\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-03","end_date":"1864-06-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After the Emancipation Proclamation, many former slaves sought to join the Union army.  However, during the Atlanta campaign that lasted from May-September 1864, General William T. Sherman, a Union commander, forbade the entry of African-Americans into the army.  Sherman did not hide the fact that he was a white supremacist.  His view represented the views of many of his men, who came from the Midwest, where racism was widespread.  He said that he would not trust blacks to fight yet.' (Smith, 229)  Rather than employ blacks as solders, he sought to employ them as laborers.  He believed that blacks should be kept in jobs that were not that different from what slaves were doing for the Confederate Army. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to keep his forces exclusively white, Sherman issued Special Field Order No. 16, which forbade recruitment officers from enlisting blacks.  To make himself clear, he warned that any recruiter who enlisted black soldiers would be arrested and possibly imprisoned.  Despite Sherman's orders, however, former slaves continued to enlist in the army in other areas of Georgia. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite strong coaxing from others, Sherman refused to change his attitude on the matter.  Even Lincoln reminded Sherman that there was a law in effect regarding black recruitment into the Union Army, and that because it was a law, all must follow it.  Sherman claimed to have the highest regard for the law, but refused to change his mind because he believed his view represented a large portion of Union soldiers.  By the early summer, the claim that the Northern war was a failure was no longer valid, and so Sherman continued to ignore Washington's pleas that black soldiers be included in white armies."],"display_date":"June 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-03","locations":[{"id":1820,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":443,"title":"Cleburne Recommends Enlistment of Blacks into Confederate Army\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-02","end_date":"1864-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In mid-1863, the Confederate Army and Confederate Congress decided that steps needed to be taken toward strengthening the Confederate Army.

Out of this idea grew the proposal to arm slaves, as well as the proposal to emancipate slaves as a reward for their service.  Gen. Joseph E.

However, the proposal did have some support (it was signed by 13 other officers), and so another officer forwarded it to Jefferson Davis instead.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Jefferson Davis did not feel did not feel that the military situation in early 1864 was enough to warrant such an extreme measure as allowing African-Americans into the Confederate Army, and so he asked that the proposal be suppressed.

Less than a year later, Davis, moved by circumstances and events, proposed to the Confederate Congress the arming of slaves.  This proposal was very similar to Cleburne's proposal.

In Boston, the regiment received a warm send-off, and the cheering crowds wishing them well were as vast as have seldom before been seen.' Not all Northerners were enthusiastic about black soldiers however. Two African American regiments were attacked in Washington by a band of Pro-Slavery ruffians.'&lt;br /&gt;The regiment did not succeed at first, but news of their valiant effort brought increased recruitment among the black community. Their efforts help sustain the Union's war effort, and slaves began to escape from their masters in the Northern slave states, so that they could enlist and fight. The success of this regiment led to the commissioning of Major Stearns to recruit African American soldiers nationally.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the commanders welcomed the new recruits. Major General N.

However, acceptance of the soldiers was not universal among fellow military men. Observing an African American regiment fighting in New Orleans, one author observed that the coexistence of colored and white regiments had led to much agitation and dissatisfaction,' and that some white officers have threatened to kill the first colored officer that offers to assume in any way military authority in their presences.' In Baton Rouge, a soldier from Connecticut argued, God never made [African-Americans] soldiers, or any thing to make soldiers of.' In addition, it dampened morale among some white soldiers as they asked themselves, What are we fighting for?

The South expressed its paternal attitude towards slavery, attacking the North for assigning the blacks in uniform the post of honorable danger;thrown forward to receive the murderous fire of the brave Confederates.' They also fault the emancipated soldiers for buying into the Northern ideology: he does not penetrate the motive that actuates his Abolition friends in endowing him with qualities and qualifications that he himself knows he does not possess.'

Hose, a farm laborer, was accused of murdering his employer, Alfred Cranford, after a dispute broke out over wages and of brutally attacking his wife, although sources differ on the precise details of the encounter. Hose escaped from Palmetto, Georgia, where the crimes took place, but was captured the following day in the neighboring town of Griffin by the Jones brothers. Citizens of Griffin wished to execute Hose immediately, but it was decided that he should be taken to the sheriff in the county seat, Newnan, so that the Jones could claim the reward that had been offered. &lt;br /&gt;          The train carrying Hose to Newnan was packed with people who were eager to witness the man's execution. As soon as Hose was off of the train, a huge mob crowded around him and marched him to the jail, cheering and shouting along the way. Plans were made to take Hose back to Palmetto for his execution; however, several prominent members of the community spoke out, pleading with the mob to allow justice to take its course. Governor Candler ordered even ordered out the troops. Upon hearing this, the mob decided that the execution needed to take place immediately and within minutes, Sam Hose was hanging from a tree. &lt;br /&gt;          Hose's execution was extremely brutal. Hose initially refused to confess, but after his ears were cut from his head, he claimed responsibility for the crimes. The Atlanta Constitution reported that 2000 witnesses watched as he was burned alive and his body cut and mutilated. Peculiarly, the man responsible for dousing Hose's body and clothes in kerosene was a stranger from the North, who was reported as saying that, though he did not know how people from his part of the country would respond to this, he felt the need to avenge the terrible crimes that had been committed. For sickening sights, harrowing details and bloodcurdling incidents, the burning of Holt is unsurpassed by any occurrence of a like kind ever heard of in the history of the state'. Even Hose's bones were taken from the scene as souvenirs. &lt;br /&gt;          Hose claimed that he was paid to murder Alfred Cranford by Lige Strickland, another African-American from the same community who was arrested and tried the day after Hose's execution. Strickland denied the accusations, but it was believed that he would be hanged regardless. The involvement of more than one black laborer led many to believe that Cranford's murder was part of a widespread conspiracy on the part of blacks. However, those present at the execution reported feeling relieved and comforted by the fact that Hose was so quickly apprehended and executed. &lt;br /&gt;          Coverage of the story varied tremendously from publication to publication, with whites typically portraying Hose as a vicious murderer, while blacks pointed out that he was never given a trial or proven guilty of the crimes which he was accused of.

Hon. Samuel Pasco, the long-time chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee, was elected to be President of the convention unanimously.  Because Florida was a relatively new state at the time, many of its delegates were not native-born.  However, they were considered to be a largely competent group representing a myriad of interests throughout the state.&lt;br /&gt;The new constitution that this body formed , a product of much political infighting and dissension -- greatly weakened the power of the governor, namely by increasing the residency requirement, forbidding a second consecutive term, and making the cabinet elected as opposed to appointed.  In addition, it made most offices at the state and local offices elective, as well as strengthening the power of local officials.  Last, and most important, it mandated the use of a poll tax as a requirement for voting.  &lt;br /&gt;The latter alteration was the direct result of a compromise between smaller black belt' counties who wanted to see all their county offices elective and those of the large and prosperous counties who did not wish the administration of their counties in the hands of people who had very little stake in it.  The resulting system was that certain important county officers would be appointed by the governor (with the consent of the Senate) while the majority of other officers would be elected, with the reassurance that a poll tax would be the prerequisite qualification in such elections if the people communicated such a wish to their representatives in the legislature.

Their suit was based not only on a charge of wrongful arrest and imprisonment but, more significantly, on the relatively recent federal Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination within the states on account of race.  Importantly, the two men made sure to fashion the legal argument in their suit in such a way so that it would be more amenable with the reasoning of the line of recent Supreme Court decisions unfavorable towards similar suits by African-Americans.

Pushed by President Abraham Lincoln, the Thirteenth Amendment worked within a year to wipe out slavery across every state in America. Immediately after the amendment was approved there was a popular demonstration supporting the decision.  Congress passed the amendment by two thirds; there were 119 in favor, 56 opposed, and 8 not voting.  The approval of the amendment meant that it would be sent to the states for ratification.  It took until December 18th for two thirds of the states in the nation to ratify and add the amendment officially to the Constitution. Illinois was the first state to ratify on February 1st and Georgia was the last, which was done as a part of Reconstruction.&lt;br /&gt; The Thirteenth Amendment passing and becoming ratified was a landmark event in American history.  It put an end to a system of slavery which had been in place for hundreds of years and founded the economy of the American South.  Immediately after this Amendment was passed, both the social structure and the economic structure of the nation were dramatically altered. People's lives all over the country changed as slaves were freed and began their own lives.  However, the ongoing war over slavery between the North and the South had divided the nation, and Lincoln understood that the best decision for the sake of the country was to push the Amendment for immediate ratification.  The immediate aftermath of the Amendment rose questions on its effects on peace within the nation and the long term effects. However, Southern Confederates were appalled by the Amendment and feared its effects on their way of life, and they feared the consequences."],"display_date":"January 31, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-31","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":576,"title":"Authorization of the Freedman&#39;s Bureau\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-03","end_date":"1865-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 3rd the U.S Congress authorizes the formation of the Freedman's Bureau.

It gave refugees clothing and food, and would assign them temporary plots of land. The Freedman's Bureau also provided the opportunity of education to blacks outside of manual labor; it taught them to read and write, and it sought to improve the lives of the black in the south.

Between the years of 1833 and 1843 Scott lived in Illinois (a free state) and a part of the Louisiana Territory that barred slavery under the Missouri Compromise of 1820.  When he returned home to Missouri, Scott claimed that after living in a free state he had become a free man and was no longer a slave.  Scott's master, Mr. John F. A. Sanford, claimed that Scott was still a slave under Article III of the Constitution.  Scott filed a petition in the St. Louis Circuit Court in 1846 and after eleven years of idling in the American judicial system, the case reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1856.&lt;br /&gt;Delivering the opinion of the Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled in a 6-3 majority that slaves were not and could not become citizens of the United States and thus were not afforded any civil liberties under the Constitution.  Under Article III, persons of African American descent were not citizens of any state at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and were instead considered beings of inferior order' by the drafters of the document.  In regards to the Declaration of Independence's claim all men are created equal,' Chief Justice Taney stated, as reported in the Richmond Daily Dispatch, It is too clear for dispute that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, for in that case, the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would be flagrantly against the principles which they asserted.'  &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the court ruled that, under Article V, it could not deprive any man of life, liberty, and property' and since Scott was in fact a slave and not a citizen, he was the lawful property of his owner, regardless if he was in a free state or a slave state.  Therefore, Scott was still a slave according to the law.&lt;br /&gt;In the second time ever, the Court used its power of judicial review to rule an act of Congress (the Missouri Compromise) unconstitutional.  The Court declared that it was beyond the constitutional powers of Congress to enact a law regarding the territories of the states.  Congress could not deprive citizens from taking their property (i.e. slaves) into and out of territories or states.&lt;br /&gt;After the infamous decision was handed down in the spring of that year, a flurry of reactions erupted across the United States.  Democrats were as quick to defend the decision as Republicans were to assault it. Many northerners felt that parts of Chief Justice Taney's decision, specifically declaring the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, were extrajudicial because they were not necessary for arriving at a decision in the case. Northerners charged that after Chief Justice Taney had shown that Scott, as a Negro, had no right to bring a case into a federal court, he should have ended his decision. Some Northerners went as far as to say the decision was a pro-slavery conspiracy.  Southerners, for the most part, stood firmly by the decision of the Court, refusing to concede that any part of Chief Justice Taney's decision had been extrajudicial. Relationships between Northerners and Southerners were already tense, but the Dred Scott decision served to further polarize the two sides.&lt;br /&gt;Frederick Douglas, a prominent African-American abolitionist, remarked after hearing the decision: The highest authority has spoken. The voice of the Supreme Court has gone out over the troubled waves of the National Conscience. But my hopes were never brighter than now.

Charlottesville acted as a hospital during the War and was thus less scathed than other small towns in Virginia by the enemy. However, the Union invasion of Charlottesville demonstrated the North's unforgiving assaults on the Confederacy.

This had been a highly controversial issue and many continued to disagree with the black involvement. Black soldiers were seen as inferior in ability, and Confederate generals and soldiers did not want to fight along side them, and they didn't trust them.  However, the law was passed and signed by President Davis, and black soldiers, in retribution for fighting were given their freedom. Able bodied black man could fight, and they were able to secure independence and receive the same rations, clothing, and compensation as white soldiers.  Black soldiers in the Confederate ranks were compiled of both slaves and previously freed blacks. Many cried out against the integration, but General Lee stated, If we do not need the negro soldiers, the enemy will.' However, the bills to pass integrated soldiers didn't get to every state, and many prolonged the process, so by the time the Civil War ended on April 9th, there was very little integration of blacks into the army which had occurred.&lt;br /&gt;Congress passes the integrated soldiers bill out of desperation of troops to fight, the South is continuously finding itself at a disadvantage in numbers, and by adding the abundant race of blacks, the odds for a turnaround in the war were more probable. Confederacy integration of black troops was a huge step for southern states as it demonstrated that they could not fight the war alone and needed the help and numbers of black soldiers. Though most Confederates were opposed to the idea, if they wanted a chance in the war, numbers needed to increase. This was also a significant step in Confederate Congress' realization that blacks were able beings who could fight beside white soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;For African-Americans, the integration bill was a ticket to freedom. Slaves had nothing to lose by joining the war as soldiers, and they saw their chance out when laws of integrated troops were passed.

The law was passed in order to speed the economic development of the island, but it had a second effect of encouraging freed slaves in the United States to emigrate.  This gave free blacks an alternative to the colonization sponsored by the American Colonization Society.  The Liberian colony which the Society sponsored was diseased and overcrowded, considered by many to be a death trap.'  &lt;br /&gt;Colonization had long been a project of abolitionists and slave-holders alike, often resulting as much from a mistrust of freedmen as from the opinion that colonization would be most beneficial to free blacks.  Opinions differed on whether it was even possible for free blacks and whites to coexist in American society.  Northern opponents of abolition had argued early in American history that liberated, propertyless, black men and women would become a burden on society.'  Free blacks on the whole seemed to oppose colonization, and some abolitionists viewed it as a means to strengthen slavery by exporting all the free blacks.  The American Colonization Society itself was a target of abolitionist ire.  Garrison, a former advocate of colonization, wondered how the Society was advancing the cause of immediate emancipation.  He also saw it as something which reinforced racism.  The Society's efforts enjoyed a surge of popularity in the 1830s after Nat Turner's rebellion, but then this support began to wane as finances decreased and as absolute emancipation and full citizenship continued to gain ground in the anti-slavery movement."],"display_date":"March 18, 1840","search_date":"1840-03-18","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":658,"title":"Southern Newspapers Report on Slave Abduction Controversy in Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-08","end_date":"1840-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the first half of the nineteenth century, slaveholders were becoming progressively more stubborn partisans of their peculiar institution.  This was happening throughout the South to different degrees.  This stubbornness manifested itself in national politics and the increasing anxiety over inter-state relations concerning slavery.  As northern abolitionism became stronger over the next few decades, there was more often trouble with northerners interfering with the southern institution whether through the government or on an individual basis.  In the Baltimore American in January, there was an article commenting on the controversy between Maine and Georgia over the abduction by two citizens of Maine of a Georgian slave.  Southern slaveholders demanded the protection of their property, but northern states had a good states rights basis for refusing to cooperate in matters of fugitive slaves.

Rather than look at this positively, white men were intimidated by blacks and thus considered Wilmington the city of lost opportunity' for white men.  Regardless of the fact that the majority of blacks in Wilmington were upstanding citizens the popular opinion among whites was that the blacks were dangerous.  Many white men were specifically afraid of black men raping white women.  Furthermore whites were angered at the insurgence of political participation by carpet baggers' and negroes.'  As a result many white men made it their personal mission to prove that blacks were socially inferior to whites.  In response to the white supremacist sentiment, the editor of The Record, the black newspaper in Wilmington published an editorial blaming white men for the fact that white women were often raped.  This was the last straw for the white democrats in Wilmington.  Soon after the publication, nine white men came together and formed the Secret Nine.'  The group's purpose was to cooperate with the North Carolina White Supremacist movement to protect their homes and their city.  The Secret Nine planned to revolt the day after the state election.  They worried that the Republican ticket would prevail and thus the city would fail to progress.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the relief of the Secret Nine the Democratic candidate, Charles B.

The citizens then drew up a declaration of White Supremacy demanding that the editor of The Record, leave Wilmington immediately, and further demanding that the most gainful employment be reserved for whites.  The resolution was sent to Negro leaders.  While awaiting a response armed white men assembled throughout the city with rifles.  They then marched to The Record burning it to the ground.  Inadvertent shots were fired injuring white men.  A large scale riot ensued between the black and white civilians.  Ultimately the editor of The Record was banned from Wilmington, and white supremacist sentiment prevailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wilmington riot occurred nearly 35 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Although the blacks in 1898 were legally free' they were still considered inferior to whites.

Although there are only three reported lynchings in Texas in 1893, Henry Smith's lynching quickly became national news. The New York Times ran the headline Another Negro Burned' and reported the story of the allegations raised against Henry Smith. A week prior to his lynching, Smith was reportedly seen carrying three-and-a-half-year-old Myrtle Vance, through the city of Paris, Texas, telling onlookers he was taking her to the doctor's office, when all along he had lured her to him with a piece of candy. Smith supposedly took the young girl to a pasture outside of the city, assaulted, and murdered her, covering her body with leaves and staying beside her throughout the night. Later the next day, after the girl's body was discovered, a search party was assembled to locate the missing Henry Smith.&lt;br /&gt;Smith was found almost a week later in Hempstead County, Arkansas and was then transported back to Paris, Texas, where his train was greeted by over 10,000 outraged citizens from all parts of Texas. Smith's torture began not long after his arrival in Paris, with his body being burned all over with hot irons for over an hour. The detailed story of Smith's Terrible Lynching' was even told on the front page of Virginia's Richmond Dispatch the day after the act took place, the paper reporting that the maddened mob tortured him with a diabolical cunning that savages only are supposed to show' (1).      &lt;br /&gt;In the years following the lynching of Henry Smith, the number of lynchings in Texas fluctuated, but the lynching of Henry Smith would eventually have an effect. Because the lynching of Henry Smith was so widely publicized and seen by all of America, a Texan antilynching movement began to work for antilynching laws.

Whitecapping in Mississippi specifically refers to using violent tactics to force African American farmers to leave their farm land and their homes. Farmers living in poverty because of widespread agricultural problems were usually the culprits of this type of violence. When a farmer was forced to give up his land because of too much debt, local merchants acquired the land and often hired African-Americans to farm the land. Poor white farmers were angered by the fact that African-Americans were farming the land that another white farmer had been forced to give up and they took out their anger on the African-Americans by using whatever means they had to force them to leave. &lt;br /&gt;The issue came to a head on May 5, 1893 when over a hundred white farmers interrupted the proceedings of the court in Jackson, Mississippi by surrounding the courthouse, pistols in hand. The presiding judge, Judge Chrisman, left the courthouse and fearlessly denounced them and ordered their arrest' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution. The whitecaps soon retreated, upon arrival of another posse of armed citizens raised by Judge Chrisman. After their retreat, the governor of Mississippi arrived with a military company to insure that the whitecaps didn't try another attack later that night.  &lt;br /&gt;The whitecaps taking part in the siege on the Jackson courthouse claimed their actions were meant as a dispute against their fellow imprisoned whitecaps being denied bail. However, the acts the imprisoned whitecaps were arrested for were acts of arson on buildings inhabited by humans, acts which were not allowed bail in Mississippi at the time. Local citizens were outraged at the nerve of the men who thought they could overrule the law with intimidation and violence. The good citizens of the county are aroused, and publicly denounce the actions of the sympathizers of the prisoners' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution.

Affects of the Civil War had created a dominant middle class, as well as a strong African American vote, in Clarke County. When the 1892 elections for Governor of Alabama arrived, most Clarke County residents supported one of two political parties- the Democratic Party or the Farmer's Alliance. The race for governor between Democratic candidate, Thomas Goode Jones, and Alliance-backed candidate, Reuben F. Kolb, promised to be a close one. Local newspapers enhanced the dramatic race by publishing warnings from the Democratic Party, stating that Misrepresentations and falsehood are the chief weapons of the Kolb party' (2). Conflict began immediately after the election, with claims that Jones' victory was the result of illegal actions, such as ballot stuffing. The front page of the Birmingham Age-Herald reported, just days after the election, that The political situation in Alabama is critical and the gravest fears of the leaders of two legislatures and two state governments from present indications, may be realized' (1). Democrats carried the black vote in Clarke County, infuriating citizens of the rural precinct of Mitcham Beat, who had turned to the Alliance after feeling ignored by their own local Democratic Party. This group of citizens of Mitcham Beat, secretly named Hell-at-the-Breech, didn't have a loyalty to the Alliance, either, but voted that way simply to be accepted politically. When the Alliance began reporting lawlessness on the part of white men in Mitcham Beat, the men took out their frustration with violence.     &lt;br /&gt;The murder of elite Democratic Party member Ernest McCorquodale, allegedly over McCorquodale's foreclosure of a Hell-at-the-Breech member's farm , was investigated, but never solved after all suspects were found to have alibis. Not long after, in June 1893, a black man, William Howze, was murdered outside of Mitcham Beat for mistreating a white woman. When the black man's brother was accused of the same crime a month later, two prominent citizens of Clarke County stepped forward to prevent his lynching. When the Hell-at-the-Breech posse confronted an upper-class store owner in a neighboring town over allegations that the store owner had mistreated a boy from Mitcham Beat, leaders of Clarke County saw connections between McCorquodale and Howze's murders. The Mayor stepped in to protect Clarke County around the same time that McCorquodale's death was avenged by the murder of Hell-at-the-Breech member, Lev James. Soon after, Hell-at-the-Breech members' names were given by tortured members and, to make a point, the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot one of the most prominent members of the group, Quincy Bledsole. Although this ended the reign of Mitcham Beat's Hell-at-the-Breech, the bitterness of the working class would live on in Clarke County."],"display_date":"June 1, 1893 - August 30, 1893","search_date":"1893-07-16","locations":[{"id":83,"lat":31.6766489025,"lng":-87.8308040287,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":787,"title":"Fire in Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-11","end_date":"1861-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A huge fire broke out in the city of Charleston on December 11, 1861.  It continued to burn into the next day.  Charleston was historically one of the wealthiest cities in the South because of its role as a leading port.  The fire attracted national attention, as the New York Times compiled what information it could from various Southern papers: A reprint from the Charleston Courier estimated the fire caused 7,000,000 in damage (in 1861 currency, not adjusted).  Close to 600 buildings 540 acres of the city burned, including five churches.  Negro shanties' may have been included in the count, exaggerating the damage, according to the opinion of the New York Times writer.  Confederate President Jefferson Davis expressed his condolences, according to a reprint from Richmond Dispatch, promising to pay part of the debt owed to South Carolina by the Confederate government.  &lt;br /&gt;The fire was thought to break out early in the morning in Russel and Olds' sash and blind factory.  By midnight much of the city was on fire.  The business and trading parts of the town, and a great part of its public edifices and churches, are in ashes,' the Times article stated.  Another article in the New York Times stated the fire was rumored to be brought about by arson many of the rumors featured slaves starting the blaze.  On December 13, South Carolina Governor Pickens addressed the state Senate and House of Representatives about the fire, as reported by the Charleston Mercury.  He noted that A great calamity has befallen our state,' and it had happened in the very place where secession had begun, as well as where the war had begun (Fort Sumter).  He called for aid for this city at the heart of the Confederacy.  I;call your immediate attention to the relief, for the present, of the poor and destitute who may be sufferers.'  There was a large outpouring of support from around the Confederacy.

The town was estimated to have somewhere around 500 buildings.  By the morning of August 8, seven or eight buildings were left standing.'  The town was located close to Fort Monroe, an important base of operations for Union forces during the war.  Union naval ships based at the fort plied the Chesapeake Bay to enforce the blockade.  A Confederate deserter reported that General Magruder wanted to burn Hampton to prevent Union troops from using the town for Winter quarters.  According to Union General Butler, commander of Fort Monroe, Union forces were intended to winter many miles beyond Hampton.'  The fire was thus a wanton act of cruelty to the resident Unionists, and moreover entirely useless,' concluded a New York Times writer.  Perhaps twenty white people and double that number of negroes' remained in the town; unaware of the fire or unable to flee, some were killed in their sleep.    &lt;br /&gt;According to the same deserter, General Magruder had left Yorktown, VA with 7,000 Confederates in order to attack Newport News or Camp Hamilton.

In May, 1861, three slaves had run away from their master and sought refuge within Union lines at Fort Monroe.  When their master, Colonel Charles Mallory attempted to claim them, General Butler refused. Butler drew on his legal training for his answer.  He called the slaves contraband,' and because they could be used by the Confederates in the war against the Union, he would not return the slaves.  This, of course, contradicted the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850.  But the Confederacy was no longer a part of the United States; therefore, rebelling states were no longer entitled to protection under United States law, Butler reasoned.  His decision infuriated southerners.  Word spread among slaves in the Hampton area, and hundreds of slaves began to flood the Union lines.  Butler employed them in digging ditches, in his words, saving our soldiers from that labor, under the gleam of the mid-day sun.'  Many of the slave women laundered uniforms for the Union soldiers.  The slaves were paid for their labor.  &lt;br /&gt;By July, there were so many former slaves living in the city of Hampton, Butler did not know what to do with them.  He wrote a letter to Secretary Cameron on July 20, published in the New York Times several weeks later.  In it, he asked, What shall be done with them?'  He continued, Are these men, women, and children, slaves?  Are they free?'  He received a reply in August, described in The New York Herald.  The response stated that Congress had passed a new act on August 6.  Fugitive slaves in rebelling states did not have to be returned to their masters, and certainly any slave used in the Confederate war effort was forfeited.  The letter was far from abolition, mentioning reimbursing slaveholders for their escaped slaves after the war.  Still, it was a step toward emancipation, and the importance of the decision was clear to both Northerners and Southerners.  News articles about the so-called contrabands' were common.  An article in December described ex-slaves living in former President Tyler's residence in Hampton.  The basement is occupied as a contraband school-room;there stood about fifty little black children as eagerly pursueing [sic] their studies as any children could,' wrote a reporter stationed at Fort Monroe.  Many of the former slaves questioned what would become of them at the end of the war.

It was formally defeated in October of 1853 by a referendum in which every county in the state of Delaware voted against it.

Upon arrival in the city, referred to by Civil War historian James McPherson as the “communications center for abolition,” Knight and Hughes were met with hostility and resistance, rather than cooperation or even legal compliance, with the Act.","William and Ellen Craft had escaped their master’s hold two years prior, in December of 1848. Ellen, being the offspring of an African American woman and her white owner, had sufficiently light-skin as to cross the color-line, disguised as an ailing white man, after obtaining the proper attire and cutting her hair. With William posing as Ellen’s servant accompanying his master, the couple traveled on a variety of steamships and trains inconspicuously even though stopping in several slave-holding areas, such as Charleston, SC, Wilmington, NC, Fredericksburg, VA, and others before finally crossing the Mason-Dixon line into Pennsylvania.","Soon after the couple settled themselves in Boston, the Crafts became involved in the active abolitionist efforts in the city. With a firm community of members in Beacon Hill, the Crafts found themselves swept up in abolitionist lecture circuits throughout the area. Unfortunately, such activism naturally increased the risk of discovery, as they told the story of their disguised escape to fellow campaigners. Thus, when the Fugitive Slave legislation passed, the Crafts’ owner knew exactly where to find the pair.","While Section 5 of the Fugitive Slave Act required that “..all good citizens [were thereby] commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law..” the reaction to Knights and Hughes was anything but. Theodore Parker, the chair of the Vigilance Committee, (the primary organization in Boston created to aide fugitive slaves, which had increased by 100 members since the arrival of the two slave catchers) hid Ellen in his home, placed William in a separate safe haven, and ensured that both blacks were guarded by at least one armed white. Additional members of the committee filled the town with notices depicting the “two prowling villains,” “the pursuing bloodhounds,” as they were described.","Yet the truly extreme abhorrence for the Fugitive Slave law among these Boston abolitionists was seen in the multiple arrests of Knight and Hughes. The two were arrested on October 26 around 3 p.m. by Deputy Sheriff Coburn, according to <em>The</em> <em>Farmer’s Cabinet, </em>on charges of slander against William Craft. After making bail, both men were again arrested some hours later, this time for conspiracy to kidnap the Crafts, accordingly in clear violation of the new legislation. Bail for each arrest was set at $10,000, and it remains unclear who posted such bail, yet speculation has been made, namely that John H. Pearson (a noted pro-slavery acquaintance of the men) and Patrick Riley (US Deputy Marshall) had a hand in assisting the men in this manner.","President Fillmore upon hearing of these actions, which effectively drove Knight and Hughes out of the city by October 30, warned the Bostonians of his inclination to send federal troops to the city to enforce the law, and assured the Crafts’ owner that he would be provided with any and all support he desired to attempt the recapture a second time.","Fillmore failed to deliver on such promises, however, as the Vigilance Committee was determined not to yield to legislation they believed immoral in all aspects. Members placed William and Ellen Craft safely on a ship destined for Liverpool by December of that year, enabling the couple to successfully continue their plight speaking out against the evils of slavery, and leaving the Bostonians to view the event as a victory among the context of the larger sectional crisis."],"display_date":"October 25, 1850 - October 31, 1850","search_date":"1850-10-28","locations":[{"id":6209,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":602,"tag":"Transportation/Migration"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":833,"title":"Southern disdain for Stowe&#39;s A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-07-01","end_date":"1853-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1853 Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the companion to her famous novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, and she titled it A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Her purpose in writing the book was to explain why she thought that whites were still unwilling to take pity on slaves.  While Stowe claimed that she understood that slaves were more than property, she postulated that other whites still saw slaves as sub-human.  Stowe did admit that she did not fully understand blacks, but she thought that by applying Christian kindness to them, their situation might be helped.  One shocking thing that Stowe revealed was that she believed that slaves repulsed themselves; she wrote that they thought they were evil because their skin was black.  She did not think that blacks were capable of reaching the same intellectual and moral heights as whites, and she blames that inability on their disgust in themselves.  Southerners were not at all pleased with Stowe's book.  Critics characterized it as having a narrow field of view.  She was accused of making generalizations about Southerners as being unaffected by the plights of slaves.  This bothered critics who felt that Southerners were not deficient in their morality.  One critic tried to explain that the North had the same prejudices as the South.  He wrote wherever man is found, we find equally the same vices, crimes, and weaknesses.   Southerners were also alarmed at the lack of biblical references in <em>A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  They felt that she was writing too righteously not to be using the Bible.

Not only did the city have to contend with an outbreak of yellow fever, but cholera broke out as well.  Most likely, the appalling sanitation system in New Orleans contributed to it.  While cholera only took the lives of 129 people in late 1853 (as opposed to the near 8,000 who died from yellow fever) it still caused serious alarm.  Most of the mortalities occurred among the immigrant community who likely had no access to proper drinking water.  Cholera also struck New Orleans poor, free blacks, who lived in filthy and cramped rooms. &lt;br /&gt;Not much was known about either yellow fever or cholera in 1853.  In fact, physicians believed that cholera was transported through the air simply because victims of cholera claimed that they had trouble breathing.  This false belief was carried out to the extreme.  No one was willing to nurse the victims of cholera back to health for fear of catching the airborne' disease.  Therefore, many victims died alone in their homes.  Fearful citizens would burn tar in the streets to create a thick smoke which they believed might help eradicate the infection from the air.  Stray animals were also believed to be vectors of infection, and people would let the dead bodies of the animals decompose in the street instead of removing the bodies for fear of contracting cholera.  &lt;br /&gt; One interesting remedy' for cholera was alcohol consumption.  This was particularly interesting in a time when the subject of temperance was so hotly debated.  Women and even children would imbibe spirits because it was believed that it would cure cholera.  The tragedy was that cholera was spread through drinking- not drinking alcohol, but drinking water.  Cholera traveled in rivers and into public drinking water.

Nearly fifteen hundred Union troops, mostly African-Americans, fought side by side against the two or three thousand Confederates stationed there. However, there still was not racially equal treatment of the soldiers, as the white soldiers rode forward on horseback, before retreating to the relative safety of the rest of the Union infantry. &lt;br /&gt;This battle was also one of the few fought with extensive hand-to-hand combat, with soldiers attacking one another with bayonets and clubbed muskets. Soldiers described it as the most gruesome and one of the bloodiest battles they had ever witnessed: Upon both sides men were killed with the butts of muskets. White and black men were lying side by side, pierced by bayonets.' Naval artillery was used to assist the Union troops, but poor communication ability caused frequent mistakes, and friendly-fire casualties resulted. Despite the presence of naval forces, the Confederates pressed on, running upon the Union troops. After several hours of fighting, the difficulties in aiming the gunboats was resolved, and the success of the naval firepower in attacking the Confederates swiftly drove them away. Despite the Union victory here, they lost more than three and a half times as many soldiers as the Confederates did.&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. Assistant Secretary of War commended the bravery of the blacks at Milliken's Bend,' for they extreme capability, contradicting earlier views that black soldiers were inferior. It was not only their bravery, but also their skill and adroit preparation that impressed. One account of the battle reads, [The commanding officer] ordered [an African American soldier] to have the men load their guns at once. He instantly replied: We have done did dat now, massa.' Before the colonel was ready the men were in line, ready for action.' As word of their abilities traveled, many become more accepting. Southerners remained skeptical of the joint efforts of black and white soldiers fighting together. They continued to refuse to realize that African American regiments were becoming successful in attacking them. The Southern standard forced them to scoff at the prospect of fighting against former slaves, so much so that they killed many that they captured rather than holding them as POWs."],"display_date":"June 7, 1863","search_date":"1863-06-07","locations":[{"id":5576,"lat":32.3562821099,"lng":-91.2432226508,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":884,"title":"Emancipation Proclamation issued\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1863-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation through his Secretary of State, William Seward. The proclamation decreed that slaves in the rebellious counties of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were to be set free. Those territories excepted were those over which the Union army had seized control during the Civil War. The list of states was notable, because although Tennessee had rebelled, it was excepted from the enumeration of affected states.&lt;br /&gt;The simple language of the manumission of the slaves was not terrible effective in its own right. The proclamation did only apply to those areas in which the Confederacy governed. One northerner described the government as having no power to enforce the decree;the paper is a dead letter.' However, the declaration that the government would recognise and maintain the freedom of such persons' was a much more promising measure since this clause would have a tangible effect at the conclusion of the fighting. Not even all Northerners were in agreement with his proclamation, suggesting that the President may free slaves so far as may be necessary to the success of his military operations,' but that any further freeing of slaves would enable the President to gain de jure control over the law of slavery.' &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln saw emancipation as a measure of expedience in a war-torn nation. In a letter to Horace Greeley, he expressed his ambivalence: If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.' The Emancipation Proclamation was no surprise to the country. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation noting that on January 1 of the subsequent year, he would issue the statement that he did. He was not held to that promise, however. His local paper gave him some leeway: He was perfectly free to exceed or to fall below the line of conduct marked out in his preliminary proclamation of September 22d.'&lt;br /&gt;Besides its primary purpose in renewing enthusiasm towards winning the war, the act was a major step in the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States, making abolition a national issue central to the Civil War, and it give interested parties around the world reason to take note. The major effect of this proclamation came about as the Union took control of Confederate states and freed the slaves therein. In addition to adding a dimension of morality to the way, it also attracted international interest as a statement on human rights. The Southern perspective of this event, however, was drastically different. Lincoln's speech, described as the world's most pitiable spectacle,' was vague' and visionary' and had already failed in practical application.' The South was amenable to a discussion of compensated emancipation, but outright rejected Lincoln's notion that he either ought to or had the authority to emancipate their slaves."],"display_date":"January 1, 1863","search_date":"1863-01-01","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":919,"title":"The Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment&#39;s Attack on Fort Wagner\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-18","end_date":"1863-07-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["July 18, 1863 marked the first time an all-black regiment fought in the Civil War.  The Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Regiment composed of only blacks and led by abolitionist Robert Gould Shaw, attacked Fort Wagner in a Union attempt to gain control of Charleston Harbor in Charleston, South Carolina.  During the recruiting process of his regiment, Shaw experienced a difficult time attempting to recruit blacks from other states to fight in his regiment due to the fact that only men from Massachusetts could receive state aid for their families if they fought in a Massachusetts regiment.  Consequently, this policy discouraged black men from other states from fighting under Shaw.  &lt;br /&gt;Along with the duty of fighting to end the Confederate stronghold on Charleston Harbor, an additional role of the Fifty-Fourth Regiment was to provide cover for the Fourth South Carolina Calvary once the cavalry was deployed at Lighthouse Inlet in Charleston.  It should be noted that although the Fifty-Fourth did fight under the Union Army, they were not always taken to kindly by even their Federal allies in other regiments.  For instance, Captain Thomas Pickney of the Fourth South Carolina Calvary admitted his disgust at fighting alongside blacks regardless of the fact that blacks were providing protection for Pickney and his comrades.  During battle, Shaw was killed leading his men on, and the Fifty-Fourth Regiment's attack ultimately proved unsuccessful due to the overpowering numbers of the Confederate Army.  Of the 600 men of the Fifty-Fourth Regiment, 272 were lost in casualties, while the Confederates lost 174.

Many problems plagued the public school system at the time, including necessary funding and the inclusion of African-Americans into the system. &lt;br /&gt;The state did not have enough money to fund the school system in 1871. In order to get funding, the state issued three modes of taxation for public schools that required schools to be partially funded by a county tax. County school districts were not eligible to receive state money if the county did not provide some of the funding. In Henrico County, not one African-American cast a vote, for or against, the local school tax when it was put to a vote because most of the African-Americans in Henrico were not property owners. The white voters determined the local tax would be initiated in Henrico County and as a result the white voters essentially allocated all of the tax revenue to the white schools. &lt;br /&gt;The state also had to determine how it would allocate its teachers. The Richmond Board of Education session of 1871-1872 needed to decide on how to allocate its teachers. It needed twelve teachers for white schools and fifteen teachers for Negro schools. The teachers with the highest scores on the teacher examination were sent to the white schools and the teachers with the lowest scores were sent to the Negro schools. During this time period it seemed improbable that a competent teacher would end up teaching at a Negro school. This Richmond Board of Education session occurred in the midst of a national debate of whether black teachers were more equipped to teach black students. In this instance, the Negro schools became the dumping grounds of the rejects of the white schools."],"display_date":"January 13, 1871","search_date":"1871-01-13","locations":[{"id":13918,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":975,"title":"Calvin v.

The state provided four different lawyers to the defendant through the trial and appeals process.  This case was also important because it was overturned in an appeal due to a technical weakness in the trial process.  The judge insisted that the law of the case is precisely the same as if the accused were a free white man'.  &lt;br /&gt;This was not usually the way that African-Americans were prosecuted in criminal procedures.

Shelley introduced a resolution in the US House of Representative to appoint a committee of five members to study the causes of the exoduster movement.  By this point the growth of the exoduster movement threatened the social and economic dominance of the white, Bourbon ruling class in the south, and represented one of the most significant movements of black resistance in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.  During the movement, originally organized by Benjamin Pap' Singleton, tens of thousands of African-Americans left their homes in the South to establish new communities in Northern states.  Although there impossible to determine the exact number of African-Americans who emigrated from the South during the exoduster movement, it is estimated that 60,000 exodusters settled in Northern states from 1873 to 1880 with approximately 20,000 settling in Kansas alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Responses to the exoduster movement varied sharply, with African American leaders, working class African-Americans, and white planters all responding the movement in sharply divergent tones.  In the wake of the economic exploitation of the sharecropping system, as well as the political repression and racial violence in Southern states following the end of reconstruction, many in the African-American working class responded to the movement by organizing public meetings to encourage and facilitate migration.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time many nationally prominent African-Americans, including Frederick Douglass, urged the African-American public not to join the exoduster movement and to remain in the South. These messages were echoed by local African-American leaders who sometimes came to exoduster meetings to urge potential exodusters to stay in their home towns.  This occurred on December 8, 1879 when former congressman Jeff Long urged attendees at meeting in Forsyth, Georgia not to leave for the North.  For their part, the organizations headed by the white economic elite from Louisville Kentucky, to East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, sought to repress the movement by concocting dubious stories about the suffering of blacks in Northern states, and by making accommodations with their black workers.  Ultimately, the exoduster movement not only presaged the great black migrations to the North in the early 20th century, but also achieved in gaining concessions from the white power structure such as lower rent rates, and usage fees for equipment for AfricanAmerican sharecroppers."],"display_date":"December 16, 1879","search_date":"1879-12-16","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1043,"title":"The 15th Amendment is passed by Congressional Republicans and then sent to the states.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-02-01","end_date":"1869-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Radical Republicans had been in the process of getting another amendment to the Constitution.

In 1830, white slaveholders consisted of only 35% of the white population of Maryland, yet controlled 60% of the seats in the state legislature -- a fact which was all to prevalent to many anti-slavery whites and to free blacks. Most of these slaveholding whites lived in the southern, peninsular parts of Maryland, and they were opposed by the more urban northern parts of the state. Henry Brawner, for example, lived in Charles County where 57% of the population was enslaved and he himself owned 58 slaves worth over 30,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was in direct contradiction to northern Maryland where 35% of the non-Baltimore black population was free, the number within Baltimore itself being even higher. This shift in northern Maryland is evidenced by looking at Maryland's different newspapers and in the reactions of white slave owners. For example, the Annapolis-based Maryland Gazette lists a number of runaway slave notices, as well as a May 13, 1830, advertisement to purchase one hundred likely negroes.' This is directly contrasted by the Baltimore based Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser, where one is hard pressed to find a single such notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White slave owners reacted to this growing free black population -- and the general anti-slavery liberalization -- of northern Maryland in a number of ways. Henry Brawner, for one, chaired a committee which urged the expulsion of free blacks from the state. In addition, both whites and some free blacks pushed recolonization' of blacks back to Africa as well as what the Baltimore American calls on January 14, 1830, the African colony in Canada.' This debate over what to do with Maryland's free black population continued throughout 1830 and the following decades, especially as the number of white slave owners fell in proportion to the more anti-slavery -- or at least anti-domination by slave owners -- northern Marylanders who begun to take more control over the state government."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":5971,"lat":38.28057998,"lng":-77.0012385843,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1068,"title":"Threat of Houston, Texas race riot leads to armed suppression of African-Americans.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-07-21","end_date":"1879-07-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Racial tensions rose to the boiling point after a black citizen named Floyd was lynched by a white mob.

On January 5th, 1866 Senator Trumbull from Illinois had presented A Bill to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and furnish a means for their vindication.' In an effort to counteract the Black Codes passed in many southern states after their reincorporation into the union.  The bill dictated that, the inhabitants of every race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery...shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue...to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property...' The Act not only guaranteed these rights to African-Americans, but also made it illegal for others to infringe upon these rights.&lt;br /&gt;President Johnson did not believe that former slaves were qualified for citizenship so he vetoed the bill. The House of Representatives voted to override the President's veto by a substantial margin. In the Senate, they barely attained the two-thirds majority required to override, thanks in part to the providential absence of two Senators, friends of the veto,' as reported by Daily National Intelligencer.  With the two-thirds vote in both Houese, Johnson's veto was overridden by Congress, the first time this had ever happened in American history. Some thought that President Johnson might not enforce the act if his veto was overridden, but the Knoxville Whig reported that if its (Congress') members conscientiously considered that they ought to pass it, he would not object, and would carry out its provisions so far as they depended on him.' Henry J. Raymond, the Editor in Chief of the New York Times and Representative in the House, called it, one of the most important bills ever presented to this house for action.'&lt;br /&gt;The Civil Rights Act of 1866 has great historical significance because it formally established the rights of the freedmen and made it a crime for these rights to be infringed upon.

In 1832, Morse began his travels back to America to the job of Professor of Painting and Sculpture at the University of New York. It was on his trip home that he overheard a shipboard discussion on electromagnets. This was the idea that sparked Morse's interest. &lt;br /&gt;Although Morse is remembered for his code, which is still in use, it was his invention of the electronic telegraph that triggered a series of other inventions that make it so significant. After many long years of inventing and perfecting his numerous creations, Samuel Morse was finally ready to present his new communication system. On May 24th, 1844 Morse sent the first electrical telegram from the Supreme Court Room in the Capitol to the railway depot at Baltimore. Transmitting over long distances with weak wires, these telegrams were signaled though the Morse code alphabet of long and short beeps. The message said, What hath God wrought?', words chosen by Annie Ellsworth.&lt;br /&gt;This new invention expedited the process of communicating within and between states. Although electrical telegrams were not used among common folk, government officials could put it to great use. Through this electronic method of communication warnings, alerts and criminal investigations could be dispatched across the country in far less time. This increased the chances of catching criminals and for a lot of people escaped slaves.

Water and boats were the only adequate forms of transportation and ultimately trade. As a cycle of reinforcement, water transport promoted trade and trade promoted water transport. Soon, with the implementation of newer materials, lighter resources and fresher ideas, boats become better and faster then before. Access to a body of water was so necessary to means of living in the 18th Century that the upper class would buy isolated houses on the water front. As long as they had access to water they did not need neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;Soon thereafter railways and trains were built and a new industrialized form of trade emerged into the South. Railroads soon became another medium of trade, though not as reliable or as fast as one would have liked. The greatness of employing trains, however, meant that resources and commodities could be found and transported to places within the states that were not on or near a body of water. In 1844, iron was implemented for both railroads and underground railroads. Southern States that bordered water, had previously relied on steam boats and water for essential transportation needs. Now, they had a fast and reliable alternate form of transport. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads provided for more unity within the states, whereby people could travel across the country for leisure. It also provided an accessible method for transporting goods and commodities for trade, such as bringing sugar from the south up to the north, which boosted the economy. This improvement also enhanced the infrastructure of America. More importantly though, the railroads were now an easier way for slaves to escape their masters and oppressed lifestyles. Blacks knew that if they made it to the North or Canada, help awaited them. Underground railroads began to flourish all over the country. Wilmington, Delaware is one example of where railroads increased and subsequently blacks were led to freedom.

Betton, the owner, surmised that Davy ran for Augusta, Georgia , his hometown , and that because he was handy with the razor and scissors,' he might try to pass as a freeman working in a barbershop.  Betton offered a 25 dollar reward to anyone who could capture Davy.  &lt;br /&gt;Although Betton revealed the human nature of his slave by describing his probable thought process and plan of action, his written attitude treated the escapee as an object, a possession.  This posting is reflective of the notion of chattel' slavery, defining owned laborers as property, which had been legally recognized by the United Stated since 1650.

The General Assembly set the grounds for the divorce, requiring that the courts determine whether or not Hezekiah had been a faithful husband, as well as whether Betsy had really committed adultery.  This is an example of someone's marriage situation, while also showing that divorce did not seem uncommon if there was a sufficient reason, such as an unfaithful spouse.  &lt;br /&gt;Another example occurred in January of 1815, where a white married woman named Mary Godsey eloped with William Arthur, another white man.

As a result of the elopement, Robert Wright submitted a petition for divorce.  This was a unique situation in two ways.  First of all, with Robert Wright and Mary Godsey's marriage, the couple violated Virginia's law that forbids interracial marriage.  However, there was no evidence that anyone in the community objected to the marriage, thus signifying that miscegenation was supported in the community.  Secondly, with Robert's divorce petition, he had the support of respectable farmers and slaveholders.

The ritual act of lynching was used by white Southerners to literally destroy the humanity of the black victim, but also to symbolically destroy that of every member of the race.  White Southerners terrorized African-Americans into submission by publicly killing a black person who violated some arbitrary behavior.  White Southerners couldn't stand the idea of a black person injuring a white person and getting away with the crime.

According to Tuskegee Institute records from 1882 to 1951, crimes that resulted in lynching were: 41 per cent for felonious assault, 19.2 per cent for rape, 6.1 per cent for attempted rape, 4.9 per cent for robbery and theft, 1.8 per cent for insult to white persons, and 22.7 per cent for miscellaneous offenses or no offense at all.  In the last category various trivial offenses were reported, such as disputing with a white man, attempting to register to vote, unpopularity, self-defense, testifying against a white man, asking a white woman to marry, and peeping in a window."],"display_date":"April 23, 1889","search_date":"1889-04-23","locations":[{"id":14155,"lat":36.8111162856,"lng":-79.3976134371,"zoom":9,"place":"PITTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1276,"title":"U.S. Senator Pierre Soule files a complaint against bawdyhouses\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-08-07","end_date":"1855-08-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A brothel located next to the home of United States Senator Pierre Soule was so disturbing to him that he filed a complaint against the crib' where whites and blacks meet indiscriminately' and make the night the accomplice of their vices and the time for their hellish amusements.'

This act was causing tensions with the British vessels that landed in South Carolina, but then lost seaman to the jails.  In February 1855, the new Governor of South Carolina visited Charleston and was asked by Robert Bunch to change the Negro Seamen Acts in South Carolina.  After much consideration, Governor Adams took Bunch's argument to the South Carolina Legislature.  In his message to the session of 1855, Adams advised that it was better to be kind to colored people,' free colored people, by allowing colored seamen of foreign ships to remain on board and not be subject imprisonment.  He advised that this would make them less inclined to denounce the institution of slavery, and that the colored hireling who may visit us will see much in their [slaves] condition to envy.'  Adams emphasizes the while we continue to discharge our true obligations to our slaves, their loyalty and fidelity remains unshaken.'&lt;br /&gt;Although the bill did not pass in the Session of 1855, it was passed in the Session of 1856.  Here is seen the importance of the institution of slavery as a way of life for South Carolinians, and the desire to publicly make it appear as a positive situation for the slaves, better than being free like the seamen, according to Adams.  He tells the legislature that liberty, shorn of all its rights, is but a miserable boon compared with their [slaves] substantial comforts and happy existence.'

In the South homicide among blacks and whites was the highest compared to the rest of the nation and world. Within the turbulent south during the 1880s and early 1890s, politics and economic turmoil' constantly threw both blacks and whites into conflict. Most violence was caused by whites going against the blacks, especially since it was they who believed that it was the blacks who were dangerous and the blacks who bred the violence that hung over the South.' Blacks, however, at times did turn against the whites, and when they did so, they risked serious punishment by the whites. As Ayers explains that because the white men believed a legal execution was too good for such criminals,' these blacks were often dragged from jail to be tortured, hanged, and burned by these mobs of white men. This very situation occurred in Eastman, Georgia on August 6, 1882. &lt;br /&gt;An argument between two black men started a riot when thousands of blacks gathered for a camp meeting. The Montgomery Advertiser simply explained that a white police man attempted to restrain the aggressor, but the aggressor knocked down the policeman. A white deputy marshal shot this aggressor, called a fleeing prisoner,' which infuriated the mob. On August 12, the Atlanta Constitution states that the marshal and deputy marshal of Eastman arrested Jake Johnson on the charge of stealing a watch, and he shot and killed him as he tried to run away.  &lt;br /&gt;As a result, the angry mob murdered Mr. James Q. Harvard whose identity was mistaken for the deputy. The Atlanta Constitution describes that young Harvard was shot through the face and in the arm, and then he was dragged into the street and his head beaten into a pulp with heavy scantlings in the hands of the brutes.'  This article also claimed that the black people called for setting fire to the white houses and killing local whites. Eventually the police was able to subdue and arrest the crowd. At the end of the riot, one white man, Harvard, and four black men were killed. &lt;br /&gt;Further, Ayers also stated that local black leaders, for their own purposes, often joined with the whites in blaming vagrant blacks for any crime in the neighborhood.' &lt;br /&gt;The colored citizens of Eastman held a meeting after the outbreak to adopt resolutions unanimously' as explained in the article The Riot at Eastman.' There were two resolutions. The first stated that they, as Christians and law abiding citizens,' condemned the actions of the mob. The second stated that they were sympathetic to the unfortunate families of the deceased. The article further explained that the Eastman County is overrun by a turbulent negro population' from Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These people are supposedly brought out to Georgia to work on  the turpentine plantations below Eastman, and these people were the lawless, turbulent, and dangerous' rioters. &lt;br /&gt;The Atlanta Constitution in the Eastman Riot' article claimed that the authorities of Eastman and Doge County were doing all in their power to bring the perpetrators of this foul murder to justice.' A few months later, twenty-five people were convicted in court. The sentence called for six men and one woman to be hanged while the rest received life sentences of imprisoned labor."],"display_date":"August 6, 1882 - August 12, 1882","search_date":"1882-08-09","locations":[{"id":1735,"lat":32.1721870425,"lng":-83.1684277696,"zoom":9,"place":"DODGE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1326,"title":"Black Farmers&#39; Strike\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-09-12","end_date":"1891-11-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Colored Farmer's Alliance organized a Black Farmers' Strike to take place from September 12- November 1, 1891 across the Southern cotton states.

He was also a somewhat successful organizer for the local Republicans and he played a key role in bringing the Republicans and the Greenbacks together. Not only were the whites persuaded that black crime was out of control, but as found in the Promise of the New South, whites were terrified of the rumors stating that black criminals were held up as heroes by the black community, championed for their bravery against persistent white.'

Mr. Allen was the children's legal guardian under Mississippi's apprentice law of November 22, 1865.  This law operated under the illusion that it was protecting young black orphans and potential delinquents.  It said that young black people, orphaned or not, may be bound into an apprenticeship.  The former owner of any young black person was given the first opportunity to claim them as an apprentice, thus legally binding them to the plantation and its owner.  When Ms. Taylor appealed to a local Freedman's Bureau agent about her situation, there was little that the organization could do.  After removing her children from Mr. Allen's plantation Taylor was brought to court where a judge told her that she must leave her children.  The Mississippi apprentice law that plagued Ms. Taylor may have been conceived at an 1865 Mississippi convention, as a bill proposed to the state legislature.  Bill No. 6 was published for the readers of the <em>Hinds County Gazette</em> to consider.  The text of this proposed legislation directly discussed the apprentice system, and the ways in which a young black person could be legally bound to a plantation owner or other sort of employer.  Article No. 7 of this bill stated that: All persons holding or taking an apprentice under this act, shall have the right to control, manage and correct such apprentice, and to require such reasonable labor, service, obedience and duty, as humanity and a prudent governor may require, not inconsistent with the relation of master and servant.  Other articles proposed to Mississippi legislature in 1865 included a restriction on intermarriage between races, and disenfranchisement of black voters.

Members of the ERA felt that the Freedmen's Bureau, though helpful, could not meet all their needs, and therefore set out for themselves to secure political equality and education for blacks.  Secrecy was an important part of the ERA's operation.  Keeping a low profile as an organization allowed members to speak their minds and avoid retaliation from local whites.  At this time in Georgia, the only other group working toward a goal of political equality regardless of race was The Union League, an organization of Southern Republicans.  By early September of 1866, the ERA, under President Samuel Brown, had affiliated with The Union League and changed its name to the Dougherty Union League.  The political work of both the Dougherty ERA and the Union League up until, and after, this affiliation helped to create a base for the Republican Party organization that would take place during Radical Reconstruction in 1867. &lt;br /&gt;Though the Dougherty County ERA sought to keep a low profile throughout 1865 and 1866, the greater organization of the Georgia Equal Rights Association did make the news.

The flagrant racism found throughout the south explains why the majority of murders were committed by white men against black victims.  However, many killings of blacks remained unreported as they often went unpunished.   All murder cases in which the victim was white were reported and the black murderer was more often than not put to death.  In 1885 a publisher  estimated over two hundred and twenty three murders occurred each year in Kentucky.  Violence towards blacks in the south was commonplace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence continued in Kentucky following the post-war periods.  Formal organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan initiated acts of violence in the years following the Civil War.  However, by 1890 Kentucky had become increasingly lawless and lesser organizations connected to the Ku Klux Klan carried out frequent acts of violence throughout Kentucky.  These groups were known as Regulators'.  They committed lawless acts under the justification that they were in fact doing their part for the preservation of justice in the white south.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, 1899 a civilian mob attacked the jail and demanded prisoner Richard Coleman.   Coleman, a cook for the Lashbrook's, confessed to the murder of Mrs. Lashbrook, whose father in law had represented Mason county in the third Constitutional Convention in 1850.  Her body was found on October 5, 1899 in a cabin on her husband's farm six miles outside of Mayesville.  On October 6, 1899 hundreds of people called for the hanging of Coleman and unsuccessfully attacked the jail at 2:00 a.m.  The following day, Mrs. Lashbrook's funeral was held and Coleman was sent to Covington for safety reasons.  Once the mob seized Richard Coleman, they burned him alive in front of hundreds of onlookers and publicly mutilated his corpse.  The African American Richard Coleman was an accused murderer.

Representation and the union were also big issues. The Kentucky legislature claimed that Congress acted unconstitutionally in attempting to adapt Kentucky law. The acts offended Kentucky due to the exclusion of Southern representation in Congress. In the eyes of the Kentucky legislature, without Southern representation Congress met illegally and unconstitutionally. Therefore, Kentucky did not consider the two-thirds of the two houses needed to pass the bills enough for them to accept the acts. Kentucky regarded exclusion particularly offensive for in their eyes both the Confederate and Union Army had behaved badly in the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kentucky Governor expressed the view that the lack of representation of the South only furthered the divide between the North and South. He regarded the acts as an act of hate towards the South.

Kentucky newspapers celebrated the speeches of their Governor condemning the acts. He prophesized the ineffectiveness of ratification for as in Northern states, the South would put restrictions on the vote to re-disenfranchise blacks. Kentucky considered the extension of the vote to Southern blacks as unwise due to the potential of corruption and weakening of the system by giving the vote to men who were not competent of their responsibility. Kentuckians gave further paternalistic reasons for the rejection of the acts. In giving the vote to an inferior race, they argued that it would draw Southern blacks from under the protective care of the superior Southern whites, and therefore lead to the destruction of blacks."],"display_date":"January 7, 1867 - October 31, 1867","search_date":"1867-06-04","locations":[{"id":4826,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1426,"title":"Formation of the Ku Klux Klan\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-04-13","end_date":"1869-02-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 13, 1867 the Tennessee Conservatives held a convention in Gallatin.

The First Reconstruction Act left the Southern States in confusion to whose role it was to reinforce the legislation. The Second Act answered this problem. It established and clarified that the military commanders held responsibility to register voters and hold elections in their territories. The Second Reconstruction Act also made two changes to the first. It required that every voter recite the registration oath promising their support to the constitution and their obedience to the law.  It met the need to deal with the many Southern office holders who had entered their post before the civil war, and so had not taken the oath of allegiance to the constitution. The act specifically disenfranchised these men, and stripped them of their office. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Second Reconstruction Act altered the First in the method of counting votes. In the First Reconstruction Act, the ratification of the constitution required a majority of all registered voters. The second changed this so that only the majority of votes cast were needed to get the constitution ratified, which enabled the constitution to be ratified much more easily against the will of many ex-Confederates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the South regarded the First and Second Reconstruction Acts as embarrassments to the constitution, Northern radicals and moderates had compromised greatly to get them passed by the two thirds of support needed in Congress. The temporary military presence in the Southern states disappointed radicals. Even with this compromise, Congress did not send enough troops South to register voters and arrange elections. The act only provided suffrage for African-Americans in the Southern states, not in the North. The strength of Free Labor ideology meant the Federal Government did not include economic assistance or the provision of permanent bureaucratic agencies to assist freedmen, greatly undermining the aim of equality for freemen. The lack of support from the South, Andrew Johnson, and the unwillingness of military commanders to override state wishes made it a great difficulty for the act to be completely fulfilled by the South."],"display_date":"March 23, 1867","search_date":"1867-03-23","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1431,"title":"The First Reconstruction Act is passed\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-02","end_date":"1867-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The First Reconstruction Act, also known as the Military Reconstruction Act, passed into law on March 2, 1867 over the veto of President Andrew Johnson. The act applied to all the ex-Confederate states in the South, except Tennessee who had already ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. It split the states into five military districts, each under the control of a Northern General whose responsibility it was to protect life and property. The First Reconstruction Act also demanded the need for new state delegates and constitutions, the ratification of the Fourteenth amendment, and the provisions of equal rights for each citizen. The most radical aspect of the Act was the enfranchisement of all citizens, except ex-Confederates, and so provided for the coming of black suffrage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The President attempted to veto the bill, for he regarded it as unconstitutional. In his eyes, the act denied the states a legal government, and therefore did not provide for the protection of rights and property. Johnson saw Reconstruction as the means to establish peace between the North and South, and resume normal relations. However, like many in the South, he saw the Act as antagonistic and contradictive of this aim. Johnson, and the South, also saw the danger in the power bestowed on the military commanders. To them it appeared as if Congress were attempting to establish a military monarchy in the South, in which the will of the commander was law, and in which cruelty against the South could be exercised at a whim. The commander could condemn a person to death without trial, determine the rights of property and the person, and dispose of land and goods. The South considered this their eventual, long feared subjugation to the North. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The First Reconstruction act raised further difficulties. Firstly, it took away the equality and validity of the Southern states to which it applied, yet it demanded that they ratified the Fourteenth amendment. Southern politicians argued that Congress had illegally passed the act due to the lack of representation of Southern states. The Southern states were left inactive as neither the military commanders nor the new delegates knew if their role included the responsibility to act in accordance to the law."],"display_date":"March 2, 1867","search_date":"1867-03-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1435,"title":"World championship fights in New Orleans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-09-05","end_date":"1892-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Boxing was extremely popular in the South, especially during the 1880s and early 1890s.

The Baton Rouge Gazette reports on January 30, 1830, that on Saturday night last about 10 o'clock Mr. John Whitten was killed by one of his own slaves, by a discharge from a musket loaded with buckshot.' Events such as this, an actual murder by a slave were extremely rare in the slave South, and when they did occur were a shock to the community and caused a great deal of anxiety and often conspiracy theories about slave uprisings -- such as fear of events like what became known as Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. As to Gazette writes when we see such outrages committed by negroes of the country, what have we not to fear from the strange negroes who are introduced every day into the State of Louisiana?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far more likely than the outright murder of his or her master was that a slave would simply run away, whether it be in an attempt to get to the North or just to a secluded local area. Southern newspapers, then, are littered with advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves as well as notices of captured runaways and where they are being held. The Richmond Enquirer, for example, lists on April 16, 1830, on a single page three different rewards for runaways and three notices of a captured slave being held in the local jail. The Raleigh Regsiter, on March 25, 1830, includes an ad entitled Notice. Twenty Dollar Reward. Ran away from the subscriber on the 10th of February.' Interestingly, here the ad describes the runaway as a white slave,' referring to his skin tone, perhaps meaning he had a white parent or grandparent. All of these ads, however, list a brief description of the runaway as well as the name given by his or her master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, sometimes the unthinkable did occur and a slave struck back. The aftermath, however, is important because it is designed to establish a sense of justice in the eyes of white slave owners, and to reassure them about the continuity of a stable slave society. Zac, for example, the slave convicted of murdering John Whitten, was described as his master's favorite,' and he confessed that he alone was guilty.' Thus, to white society this was a single act by what was likely a deranged individual. After all, why would a slave who was his master's favorite' have any reason to kill that master?"],"display_date":"January 30, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-30","locations":[{"id":5501,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1466,"title":"Lynchings in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-07-05","end_date":"1892-07-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Smith Tooley and John L.

It is no wonder, therefore, that in what is still primarily a slave-based economy, especially in the South, Americans began to wonder what to do with this growing free black population. After all, how could formerly enslaved blacks fit into white society when President Andrew Jackson had declared that even the recognizably free Indian tribes were no better than savage hunters' with rude institutions' in a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a number of options available to whites as to what to do with freed blacks. For starters, Henry Brawner of Maryland chaired a commission that encouraged all free blacks be deported from the state immediately upon becoming emancipated, and similar ideas showed in other states at various times. One of the most popular ideas at the time, however, was Recolonization' of blacks back to Africa. In an address to the American Colonization Society, reprinted in the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser on January 14, 1830, Henry Clay argues that as the two races progressively multiply and augment the source of supply of labor, its wages will diminish, and the preference already noticed will be given of free to slave labor.' As a result, he says, pinched by want, and neglected by their masters;. (slaves) would be stimulated to the commission of crimes' or potentially to rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, many white Americans urged free blacks to emigrate back to Africa. Specifically, on March 25, 1830, an advertisement in the Raleigh Register offered immediate information' to any free blacks desirous of accepting the opportunity thus offered of joining the settlement of free persons of color at Liberia.' However, recolonization to Liberia was not the only option for free blacks. A number of Northern states were beginning to tolerate, if not openly accept, the growing free black population -- including, for example, Northern Maryland and especially Baltimore which had a large number of free black residents. Finally, there was an African colony in Canada, the destination of many runaway slaves, which as the Baltimore American reported on January 14, 1830, amounted to about 2000' persons. Overall, however, most whites simply did not want free blacks living in their community; especially Southern whites to whom free blacks, and especially successful free blacks, represented a direct contradiction to an economic system and a way of life based on racial inferiorities."],"display_date":"January 14, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-14","locations":[{"id":4823,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1485,"title":"Judson Lyons Rejected as Postmaster of Augusta, GA","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-07-01","end_date":"1897-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Under the heading Not a Negro' the Birmingham's Age-Herald reported that Augusta, Georgia would not have a colored postmaster'.

The Postmaster General of Augusta said that he would dare not inflict on any community a colored postmaster, provided it has never been done before.'&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this event revolves around racial tensions within a particular community, notably that many whites were extremely uncomfortable with African-Americans holding any type of authoritative or leading positions in societies.  However, as Secretary Gary mentioned above, this was also a very political move, showing the strong sectional ties and their differences between the Populist and Democratic parties.  It is of note here that many African-Americans were Republicans during this time period.&lt;br /&gt;In November of the same year, the Populists claimed that the Democrats were pushing the idea of an African American postmaster in Kinston, North Carolina.  The reasoning, according to the Populists, for the Democratic endorsement of this man (J.C. Hargett) was that it would generate political capital for them and would enable them to easily carry the county.  Furthermore, they charged the Democrats of circulating a petition setting out the fact that Hargett is a Negro of good character, and that he would be a very good postmaster.'  The Handbook then goes on, charging the Democrats of hypocrisy, that they are putting African-Americans in post-offices because they think it will give them party advantages despite their loud professions for white supremacy.'  &lt;br /&gt;This above scenario is a sad but true account of the strong racial tensions that existed in America as began the nineteenth century.  Disfranchisement laws and other forms of social repressions, including lynching, of African-Americans seemed to unite the South during this time period."],"display_date":"July 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-07-01","locations":[{"id":2194,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1490,"title":"The Formation of the Republican Party in North Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-27","end_date":"1867-03-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 27, 1867, the North Carolina Republican Party officially formed at a meeting in Raleigh.

The ex-Confederates went to prove their reluctant acceptance of Congress' decisions because they did not want to antagonize Congress further by resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third group of carpet baggers' represented white Northerners, who again reflected a variety of motives. Some had come down to the South to genuinely help the freedmen in their citizenship.

By these rules, a contract for the labor in question had to be produced in writing and given to an agent of the Bureau. It was also stated that, The employer will stipulate to provide good and sufficient food, quarters, and medical attendance for the entire family...' The contract made between Bath and Littlepage deviated quite significantly from these regulations. In their agreement, Littlepage agreed to farm part of Bath's land in shares in return for one half the cotton and one third of the corn raised. In the contract, Littlepage was required to supply his own mule, do all of the woodwork on the plows and pay for one half of the cotton, potato and pea seeds. Bath took no responsibility for the health and welfare of Littlepage's wife and children, the contract dictating that Littlepage had to pay for all his family's doctor visits.&lt;br /&gt;Although not important on the national, regional, or even state scale, the contract serves as a valuable example of the economic options open to African-Americans in the South.

In addition, referring to southern laws regarding African-Americans, he acknowledged that some (especially in the North) question the South, its history and its dealing with race relations.  Patterson added that the South's reforms (segregation laws) fail to make southerners disloyal and treasonous.

After the peace at Appomattox Courthouse, each state formerly in rebellion needed to create a new Constitution that conformed to the requirements set out by the President. A.J.

Delegate Roberts hoped that Texas would adopt, a white man's government' that would keep Sambo away from the polls.' His goals became a reality as the convention passed the Constitution with a literacy requirement for those wanting to vote. The Texas Constitutional Convention displayed the unwillingness of many Southern states to submissively adhere to the orders of their Commander in Chief.

South Carolina led the way , in the upcoming election of 1888, many candidates promised their constituency that they would introduce voting reform' that sought to ultimately disenfranchise blacks. Floridians followed suit when, in the same year, representatives from the Florida legislature presented a bill proposing a tax upon all voters. Though the legislature did not unanimously support the bill, they finally passed and fully enacted it a year later. It effectively made Florida the first Southern state to institute a poll tax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of this law were almost immediate. In the 1888 Presidential Election, a record 62% of black males and 75% of total eligible males voted. Only four years later, the figures had dropped to 11% and 39%, respectively. These statistics also illustrate an interesting side note: poll taxes and literary tests curbed both poor blacks and whites from voting. Most importantly, the Florida poll tax put a complete end to the gains of Florida's blacks during Reconstruction. At the peak of Radical Reconstruction in 1870, for example, Josiah Walls became the first black Congressman from Florida.

Also, he did research in which he developed commercial uses for many products, including peanuts, sweet potatoes, cotton and pecans.

Members of the Colonization society wanted the abolishment of slavery as an institution, but with that end, they also cried for removal of the entire black race.

This prompted feelings of anger and resentment toward organizations like the Colonization Society because though whites spearheading such efforts meant well (for the most part), they were effectively ripping blacks from their homes and families in the United States to send them to a strange and foreign place; a twisted costal role reversal from years past.  Just as the Africans brought into slavery in the United States were not American, the free blacks being taken to Africa from the United States were not African, but African-American.  White opposition came from two ends; some argued that there was no need for removal and total segregation of the races in order to achieve a peaceful and functioning society.  Other arguments rested on the tenet of the project's improbability of success, cost, and length of completion.","The Brig Nautius captained by a Capt.

Boats similar to the Brig Nautius sailed for the African colony from southern ports throughout the decades surrounding 1821 as part of an effort asserted by the American Colonization Society to rid the United States of what they continued to be the inevitable failure of free coexistence of the white and black races.  Members of the Colonization society wanted the abolishment of slavery as an institution, but with that end, they also cried for removal of the entire black race.  This removal, they stated, would end in the completed and successful colonization of a free black settlement on the coast of Africa set up by the U.S. government.  ","Although states in the south such as Virginia saw considerable rallying in support of the Colonization Society, there was also staunch opposition on behalf of both blacks and whites.  No doubt, few free-blacks living in undesirable conditions saw resettlement in Africa as an attractive option, and means by which some who had not been in the states for very long could reunite with family members left behind in Africa; however, by 1821 the majority of blacks living in the United States were products of one or more generations of life on American soil.  This prompted feelings of anger and resentment toward organizations like the Colonization Society because though whites spearheading such efforts meant well (for the most part), they were effectively ripping blacks from their homes and families in the United States to send them to a strange and foreign place; a twisted coastal role reversal from years past.  Just as the Africans brought into slavery in the United States were not American, the free blacks being taken to Africa from the United States were not African, but African-American.  White opposition came from two ends; some argued that there was no need for removal and total segregation of the races in order to achieve a peaceful and functioning society.  Other arguments rested on the tenet of the project's improbability of success, cost, and length of completion."],"display_date":"January 23, 1821","search_date":"1821-01-23","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1681,"title":"Spain Officially Cedes Florida to the United States/ Ratification of the Adams-Onis Treaty\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-02-19","end_date":"1821-02-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1818, President Monroe sent General Andrew Jackson to Spanish Florida to subdue the Seminole Indians, who were raiding American settlements. Liberally interpreting his ambiguous instructions, Jackson led his troops deep into areas of Florida under Spanish control, capturing two Spanish forts. Because Florida held the potential of becoming a new slave state, southern congressmen eagerly backed Jackson's plans.  In addition to securing greater protection for American settlements, the mission helped to expose the vulnerability of Spanish rule in Florida. Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, used that vulnerability to pressure Spain into selling Florida to the United States, and after ratification of the Adams-Onis treaty outlining the conditions of the purchase and drawing territorial boundaries for the remaining Spanish holdings in North America, the U.S. government purchased Florida in February of 1821 for five million U.S. dollars, all of which was paid directly to U.S. citizens with claims against the Spanish government.  General Jackson was appointed Military Governor of the Territory in March, and resigned in December of the same year. Florida was not signed into statehood until March 3, 1845 during the Presidential term of John Tyler. ","During the later years of the eighteenth century and start of the nineteenth century, Spanish Florida saw an onslaught of immigration from U.S. states due to attractive land grants and because it was seen as a safe haven for escaped slaves seeking refuge from U.S. laws binding them to harsh masters and conditions in the southern plantation states.  Though runaway slaves viewed Florida as a place to find freedom, slave traders considered Florida an ideal place of business.  Although in 1808 the U.S. passed laws prohibiting the importation of African slaves, because Florida was still under Spanish rule and in combination with its abundance of coastline, slave traders brought African slaves into Florida and then smuggled them into Georgia to be sold to plantation owners.  The Florida slave trade continued even after the United States took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1821.  Plantation owners began to immigrate to Florida, bringing their slaves with them, and the population of Florida more that quadrupled between the years of 1830 and 1860.  However, the population of free blacks barely increased.

His experience in politics, high intelligence, and knowledge of Louisiana law led to his early admittance. Percy Bysshe Shelly Pinchback became known as one of the most brilliant politicians of his era. His father died when he was a young boy, and the father's relatives disinherited the 10 children he had sired from his mulatto mistress and attempted to sell them back into slavery as well. The children were sent to safety in Cincinnati, and conditions led to P.B.S. Pinchback to fend for himself at the young age of twelve.  From a cabin boy in Cincinnati, he was convicted of assault with attempt to murder at age twenty five and sentenced to two years in the workhouse in New Orleans. After serving his time he enlisted in the First Louisiana Volunteer Infantry. Although was so fair-skinned that he could pass for a White man, he was known to stand up for his race at all times. He became Captain, and did an admirable job at recruiting colored troops, however was denied his commission on the grounds of him being a Black man. This was because no authority existed for the employment of colored persons in any position other than privates, citizens and noncommissioned officers. Eventually he was elected state Senator, president of the state senate, lieutenant governor, president of the board of metropolitan police, and finally nominated by the Republican state convention for governor. In 1873 the legislature elected Pinchback U.S Senator for a full term, and he had the distinction of being member-elect of both houses of Congress. Trouble ensued when racism caused the removal of this title for a short period of time, and he made a famous speech exposing this very fact. During his service, he introduced and secured the adoption of the Thirteenth Article, which guaranteed civil rights to all people of the state of Louisiana regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude', and although he received much criticism he steadfastly insisted that blacks receive equal accommodations. Pinchback was a credit to his race, and although the ignorance of prejudice hindered his success at times, he was a notably brilliant man loved by both sides of the color line in the end.&lt;br /&gt;Mulattoes in the nation's history, especially from the Deep South, came to occupy political positions much more frequently than their Black non-mulatto counterparts, who were kept out of elite circles unless extremely successful. Mulattoes formed a distinct social caste in the late 19th century and early 20th century, gaining respect and credibility quicker than Blacks among important Whites because of their mixed blood ancestry. Mulattoes by default were seen as more assimilated into society by Whites and Blacks alike because they represented the ability to straddle both sides of the fence, and to be an intermediary between the two races. While at this time many fair skinned mulattoes were choosing to pass for White to escape the stigma of Blackness, Pinchback represented a part of this group which claimed their African lineage and used their intelligence and opportunities to try to improve conditions for their race."],"display_date":"April 10, 1886","search_date":"1886-04-10","locations":[{"id":5601,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1802,"title":"African-Americans Gain Control of Tuskegee Institute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-05-01","end_date":"1892-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1892, Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, founded by Booker T.

As part of his weekly papers, Lovejoy printed national and international news on a variety of subjects, most frequently the debate on slavery. Lovejoy printed one of these hotly debated articles on September 17, 1835, when Asa A. Stone's editorial article on the clothing condition of slaves in the South appeared in the Observer. Stone claimed that blacks' absence of clothing was a function of slave choice and low intelligence, not the poor treatment slaves received. The article angered free black supporters and abolitionists alike in Missouri and fueled further efforts of abolitionists who worked to erase the misconceptions printed by pro-slavery advocates."," This fight over slave conditions took on a fervent religious tone that highlighted the basic equalities of man, regardless of skin color. Lovejoy and his abolitionist publishing staff inserted an interesting caveat that preceded Stone's editorial. That the Christian slave-holders-at least so many of them as read the Observer-we only ask of every brother, when about to complete the bargain with the negro-driver...Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even to them for this is the law and the prophets. "," When Stone wrote that Thousands of Creole slaves of Louisiana do go naked, from choice, in the summer time...it is a common, I must say general practice to raise children without any clothing whatever, either in summer or winter, he failed to realize that many of these slaves did not wear clothes for reasons other than their inherent primitiveness. Often, economic conditions of black and white alike dictated what was available. On poor white farms and small plantations, the availability of fabric was limited only to white households. Hannah Jones, a former slave, recounted that for blacks without any source of income or education, it was impossible to gain fabric to clothe a family. As Jones' told of her experience, Old Marse Ben died and after dat Tom carried us all back down der to New Orleans wid him and opened up a n*r pen. Dat's a place like a stock yard where dey auction us off. We only know our ages by known' we is born in corn plantin' and cotton pickin' time. We never even knowed de days of de week. "," Many times, slaves only received new clothing when sold by slave traders. As Walter Johnson notes, future jobs slaves were to perform dictated clothing; future field hands dressed in far fewer and shabbier clothing than hotel workers or household workers. Often in addition, clothing covered up scars and illnesses in the marketplace, so nakedness was desirable in commodities sales. For slaves with particularly cruel masters, the scars left from whippings were often very visible. Another slave, Henry Johnson said, In de start de slave has been stripped naked, and lashed, often to death. Dey would be left strapped after from twenty-five to fifty lashes every two or three hours to stand dere all night...I never knowed what a shirt was until I was past twenty. "," The situation in which blacks lived in the South-for most, not of their own volition-sparked not only distaste of slaveholders, as Johnson notes, but the slave traders as well. Stone's editorial in the Observer brought further national debate on the premise of white superiority over blacks, especially in the South. The basic need for clothing ignored by slave owners, whether out of cruelty or poor economic success, could not be further avoided; even Stone himself stated that he could not comment on the debasing influence of a system that can produce such a state of things."],"display_date":"September 17,

would be too good.Unspeakable tortures of accused black criminals would often occur before a fair trial was given time to occur.Newspapers were hesitant to accuse townspeople of performing a lynching, instead focusing on the brutality of the crime committed by the murdered black man.Although lynching was not very common in Virginia compared to other states such as Kentucky and West Virginia, it was still a problem.In Richmond, lynching was rare because it had an established police force.However, the outskirts of Richmond were not as densely populated as the city."," By far the crimes that caused lynchings most often were crimes against white women.Assault and rape against black women sent white communities into a rage.The reason for such a strong reaction to these crimes was the belief that black men lusted after white women.The intensity of the reaction of whites towards these crimes caused blacks to teach young boys to avoid all contact with white women to prevent being falsely accused.The violence that occurred in the 1890s was an indicator that there were major problems regarding interracial relations.Even forty years after the abolition of slavery, there was still a long way to go before blacks and whites could live together without fear."],"display_date":"September 4,

passerby saw the scuffle and the man ran away.The man attempted to continue the assault after the car had passed but Mr. Riggins was able to run away.The man was disguised and Chastain Riggins was unable to distinguish anything about the man other than his size and race.The perpetrator in the incident was referred to as the large negro report.The incident took place in an alleyway near Fourteenth Street, between Semmes and McDonough.Mr. Riggins' watch chain was damaged during the assault."," The late 1800s were a difficult time for Richmonders.Reconstruction took a toll on Southern cities, as technology and commerce lagged behind the rich Northern cities.Because of the lack of commerce and economic improvement, Richmond developed slums.Poor black families as well as struggling whites moved into the cities to find low wage jobs but there were very few positions to go around.Overcrowding caused areas of the city to become dirty and unsanitary.Edward Ayers described buildings in the city as having broken front doors that cannot be closed, revealing decaying floors, broken walls, stairways, and hallways reeking with dirt; chimneys tumbling, streets littered, everything in and about tending to degrade the human beings that call this section home.The sanitation of the city was also a mess.Indoor plumbing was a luxury that only the richest could afford.The streets wreaked of excrement from both humans and horses.This horrible way of life that many Richmonders experienced, coupled with the lack of jobs in the city, made crime a viable option for many."," As illustrated in Mr. Riggin's experience, most of the reported crimes in the newspapers described crimes committed by blacks against whites.Newspapers were extremely biased during the 1890s.The newspapers refer to all blacks as Negro's and their descriptions lead the reader to regard blacks as animalistic.The racist narration is repeated in the police logs day after day.However, crimes committed by whites against whites are narrated differently, often referring to the criminal formally using Mister.Although both black and white criminals often lived in the same slums and committed the same crimes, the

Washington's speech concluded with an eruption of applause from the audience.The event went without incident and was considered a great success."," Segregation and inequality dominated the post-war South.Even with slavery forty years in the past, blacks were still expected to act a certain way.Blacks were expected to treat whites with the utmost respect.When in the presence of whites, black men were expected to remove their hats.Blacks were also expected to greet whites formally.Whites on the other hand were not expected to remove their hats, even when in the home of a black man.Whites would also refer to blacks very informally, using boy or George.Even newspapers followed this etiquette.Newspapers referred to blacks always as negroes.There was very little equality in the South."," The visit from Booker T.

Hamilton ran a regular advertisement for his services in The Nashville Daily Union. In the advertisement he ran on Saturday, July 6, 1850, Hamilton reassured his former patrons that he planned to remain in the business of buying and selling cotton. Hamilton thanked the public for the business they provided him in that venture. Directly below he advertised his steamboat packets. Through this advertisement, Hamilton reintroduced himself as an agent of the steamers that traveled between Nashville and New Orleans, and Nashville and Memphis. In addition, the advertisement declared Hamilton's need to hire 100 NEGROES to work on the steamboats that traveled back and forth along these two routes. Although he claimed to want to hire these black workers, he did not necessarily mean to hire them independently. Some slave owners often hired their slaves out to others within their community, keeping the salaries for themselves. "," Hamilton advertised two types of steamboat packets. The first he described as regular packets traveling from New Orleans to Nashville. The steamers left the port of New Orleans every Tuesday at four o'clock in the afternoon for Nashville. The steamer left to return to New Orleans from Nashville every Saturday afternoon at four o'clock. The advertisement described the other packet as weekly. It left Nashville for Memphis every Monday at four o'clock and left to return to Nashville from Memphis on Thursday mornings at ten o'clock. "," Before railroads, steamboats provided the most rapid means of transportation of both people and goods. Tennessee played a large role in this river transportation. The Cumberland River ran through the middle of Tennessee eventually intersecting with the Ohio River. The Ohio River indirectly connected cities along the Cumberland River, specifically Nashville, with the burgeoning steam boat economy of the Mississippi River. "," The shipment of iron along the Cumberland River became a vital part of the economy in the middle region of Tennessee. Historian Byrd Douglas argues that if it had not been for the Cumberland River, which served as the only medium of transportation, this essential product, which played such an important part in the development of our country, could not have reached the market. Steamboat packets, like those advertised by A. Hamilton, provided the most efficient means of transportation between the South-western states. Tennessee did produce large amounts of the South?s staple crops, tobacco and cotton. But iron production proved to be more beneficial to the economy of the Cumberland region of Tennessee and thus made Nashville one of the largest cities in the South. The shipment and production of iron made Tennessee an industrial state juxtaposing it to many states within the South that found economic success predominantly through agriculture."],"display_date":"July 6, 1850","search_date":"1850-07-06","locations":[{"id":11953,"lat":36.1785835172,"lng":-86.867295434,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1997,"title":"The 50 Dollar Reward for Harry the Runaway\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-12-12","end_date":"1846-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 12, 1846, Landon Harrison ran a wanted advertisement in The Nashville <em>Daily Union</em>. Months later, on Saturday, March 27, 1847, the Daily Union continued to run the advertisement. One of the slaves on Harrison?s plantation ran away, and Harrison entered a wanted ad in hopes of having him found and returned as soon as possible. In order to ensure the slaves safe return, master's like Harrison made thorough descriptions of their slaves in want ads. Historian Michael Mullin points out that whites identified ethnicity in three ways, appearance, patterns of scarification, and by dialect. In his wanted advertisement, Harrison described Harry as a young negro boy of around 18 years of age. Harry stood about five foot three inches tall with a black complexion. When he left Harrison's plantation he wore a mixed jeans frock coat, and a green blanket coat, and a palm leaf hat. Harrison believed that the boy traveled to the towns in which he had the closest relations: Gallatin and Lebanon."," The first line of Harrison's wanted advertisement stated the reward for the runaway in bold print. Landon Harrison offered 50 dollars reward for the return of Harry. He requested that if anyone found Harry, they needed to return him directly to the Nashville jail. From there, Landon Harrison would determine the reward by whether or not the capturer found Harry within the borders of the state. If captured within state lines, the reward stood at 25 dollars. If captured across state lines, the reward doubled to 50 dollars. Landon Harrison's reward was indicative of a slave's monetary worth. The further away an escaped slave managed to travel the less likely he is to be caught. Thus the monetary reward should be greater if someone captured Harry outside of the state. The slave master feared unoccupied, unsupervised slaves because of the cost they incurred when slaves escaped. Slaveholders knew the loss of investment that accompanied the loss of a slave."," Runaways who were returned to their owners received harsh punishment for attempting to escape. Michael Mullin gives one account of a master who bound, gagged, and left his slave to insects for running off. Sometimes, however, masters sold their runaways once someone found and returned them. Some masters did not want their other slaves to believe that they too could escape and get away with it. So instead, the master acted as though he made the decision to sell the slave in the first place. Slaveholders through out the South struggled in this same sense to maintain their power and threatening force over their slaves, who increasingly sought to experience freedom."],"display_date":"December 12, 1846","search_date":"1846-12-12","locations":[{"id":11952,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1999,"title":"The Mixed Congregation of St. John&#39;s Church in Ashwood\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-01-01","end_date":"1841-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the fall of 1841, the townspeople of Ashwood erected St. John's Episcopal Church halfway between Columbia and Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee. A Philadelphian man gave an in depth account of the church?s first service in a letter he wrote to the editor of The Guardian. As a northerner, he acted as an outside observer in this small southern town. He elaborately described the architecture, location, congregation, and leaders of the newly built church. "," Reverend Bishop Polk built the church on a lot adjacent to his plantation in Ashwood. He and his three brothers chiefly financed the church's construction. The location of St. John's was ideal for both the Bishop and the Episcopal families that lived in the surrounding area. Although not many Episcopal families lived in Ashwood, the Bishop and other founders intended the church to serve as a place of worship for the slaves of these few families. On the day of the first service, the church welcomed these slaves into the congregation. The anonymous Philadelphian described at length the four and half hour services that transpired that day. Reverend Bishop Otey, Reverend Bishop Polk, Reverend Smith, and W.F. Leacock of Williamsport consecrated the church. Following the consecration, Reverend Otey presented candidates for baptism and Reverend Polk performed two confirmations. The proceedings of the service that day impressed the Philadelphian. Nothing could compare, however, to the sheer composition of the congregation. The number of slaves in attendance came as a shock to the Philadelphian. And a more happy group I have seldom seen, he enthusiastically observed. He recalled the Bishop's invitation for blacks to come forward at the same time as whites to receive communion. Ah, could some of our friends have witnessed that scene, how would it have silenced the suspicion that the slaveholder values not the soul of his slaves, the northerner exclaimed."," In the South, African Americans and their masters often shared in the church-going ritual. Historian Bobby Lovett confirms the importance of the church services and the socializing that took place afterwards. These services consumed a great portion of the day and thus it was most convenient for the owners to take the slaves belonging to the family to church with them rather than leave them unattended for extended periods of time. But unlike the scene in Ashwood, Tennessee, churches in other regions of Tennessee or the South often participated in greater discrimination. African Americans usually took communion last, they sat in the rear of the church in all black pews, and the church prohibited them from becoming officers within the church government.

Palmore, an attorney in Fayette County, Tennessee, wrote a letter to one of his colleagues. Attorney Edward Brown received the letter from Palmore in Ballsville, Virginia. Palmore boasted the supremacy of the state of Tennessee to the state of Virginia. I will say nothing about the fertility of our soil and other advantages afforded here to the young and enterprising, Palmore declared. He quickly transitioned into the matter he wished to discuss: the issue of the settlement of John Robinson's estate."," C.S. Palmore acted as the administrator of Robinson's estate. He discussed primarily the placement of John Robinson's negroes. Initially Palmore left them with a woman by the name of Miss Frances. Yet as Palmore specified, Robinson did not name Miss Frances as the legatee of the estate. By legatee Palmore meant beneficiary, or the person named in a will to receive part or all of the state. In fact, in his letter to attorney Edward Brown, Palmore acted concerned only with the need for the legatees to pay Miss Frances for her trouble and expense as caretaker of Robinson's slaves. He hoped that Brown could help him find the legatees, a family he finally referred to as the Merymans. Palmore proposed that Brown act as (his) agent in the matter and if the legatees apply for their negroes if they will pay all charges and will release me in your better judgment you may let them have them or if they will sell them to you it will meet my full and harty approbation."," John Robinson?s written will provided instructions for the delegation of all his estate. C.S. Palmore struggled and sought help on only the matter of the future of Robinson?s slaves. Although the woman he referred to in his writing seemed to willingly look after Robinson?s slaves, Palmore pointed out the imposition of this to Edward Brown. Miss Frances benefited only marginally if at all from keeping Robinson's slaves. He seemed to insinuate that the cost was more than she can afford. Palmore declared to Brown that Miss Frances' account for raising George (one of Robinson's slaves) up to the first of February 1845 was 66.73 dollars. "," Slaves like George could either be an asset or a liability in the South. Robinson?s slaves became a liability to Miss Frances and she could only profit from their sale. Bobby Lovett's <em>The African-American History of Nashville, Tennessee</em>, describes a similar exchange that was had with a slave named Frank. When Frank's owner died he was left to his heirs who promptly made plans to convert this asset into cash. Whether in Tennessee, Virginia, or elsewhere in the South, inherited slaves posed a problem to both executors and beneficiaries of estates. Slaves required housing, food, and clothing. Slaves possessed too great a value to just give up, but created a cost that some inheritors could not afford to bear."],"display_date":"March 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-03-01","locations":[{"id":11986,"lat":35.1984324227,"lng":-89.4156896322,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2006,"title":"Townsmen Pledge to End the Sale of Liquor in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-05-13","end_date":"1876-02-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Baldwin Buckner, a physician from Louisa County, Virginia, was a determined and resolute man.  He held fast to his beliefs in spite of outside pressures that urged him to do otherwise.  Buckner refused to give his son, Horace, any extra funds besides those that were sufficient to cover his boarding expenses while he was teaching.  In letters that Horace wrote in 1875 and 1876, he made a desperate plea to his father to send money.  Horace asked his father, Do you mistrust me so much as not to be able to trust me at all?  Horace confessed that his gambling and drinking had contributed to his previous problems in money management but swore that he no longer engaged in either activity.  Yet, a year after Horace claimed he was abstaining from liquor, he wrote his father an additional letter.  In this letter Horace recounted his participation in a fracas, in which his hand was bitten through.Horace's description of the event was notably brief and void of detail; Horace left it up to his father to decide whether his son and the aggressor were intoxicated the night that the fracas occurred.  Buckner refused to provide Horace with funds to be used at his discretion.  Central Virginians like Buckner realized the necessity of action at all levels of society, including the family, in order to further Prohibition in Central Virginia.","Community leaders in Central Virginia other than Buckner took action in their region to enforce growing sentiments regarding the impropriety of liquor consumption, in response to the spread of Prohibition across the South in the second half of the nineteenth century.  In 1883, a group of seven men from Fluvanna County signed a petition and sent it to three fellow townsmen, in an effort to entice locals to pledge that they would help to end the sale and distribution of liquor in the county.  In the January 27, 1885 publication of Fredericksburg's local paper, the <em>Free Lance</em>, the editor posted the names of the officers along with the meeting times of several local groups of prohibitionists.  Two of these coalitions, the United Lodge Sons of Sobriety and the Stonewall Lodge Sons of Sobriety, were exclusive to men.  The other temperance groups the paper advertised had religious affiliations, such as the Grand United Order of True Reformers, Christian Star Lodge, No. 29.  The paper specified that the members of this group were colored, and the paper listed both men and women as the officers of the Order.                  ","Groups of impassioned local citizens with the same determination as Buckner joined forces in order to attack the problem at the state level by forming a larger contingency of social reformers in Virginia, according to Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hoftstra in <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>.  In 1883, eight local chapters of the Women's Christian Temperance Union merged in order to form a version of the WCTU that serviced the entire state of Virginia.  According to The Encyclopedia of Religion in the South, the beliefs of Christians across the South concerning the accountability of the individual for his or her sins and improprieties gave impetus to the formation and activity of both the WCTU and other local prohibitionist groups.  Groups of African American Christians, like the Fredericksburg Grand United Order of True Reformers, played an integral role in the spread of Prohibition in Virginia and other southern states, as well.  ","Although there is a wealth of information regarding the success of the groups that coalesced in an effort to further Prohibition, less is known about the actions of individuals, such as Horace Buckner's father.  Yet these individuals' actions were equally essential to the success of the movement.  Because women made great strides in the Prohibition movement as a result of their activism, historians have focused mainly on women's efforts.  Thus, the correspondence between Buckner and his father is a relatively rare chronicle of the manner in which a man labored to establish abstinence in his family.  Prohibition was personal.  Although Prohibition was a political issue, it was a topic that commanded the attention of individuals, like Dr. Buckner, throughout the nation who had personally witnessed the damage and destruction that resulted from the use of alcohol."],"display_date":"May 13, 1875 - February 9, 1876","search_date":"1875-09-26","locations":[{"id":14013,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2013,"title":"Race Relations in the Late Nineteenth Century in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-05-05","end_date":"1888-05-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As William Bibb read the letter, he grew anxious and apprehensive about the decision he had to make.  Bibb, a Louisa County attorney, received a letter on May 5, 1888 from R. M. Barllock in Woodburn, Virginia asking Bibb to represent him in a law suit involving a former slave.  Barllock wanted to collect money from the estate of a man who had passed away several years ago.  In his letter to Bibb, Barllock explained that the suit was in favor of a former slave, Bob Carr, who was attempting to claim the legacy that he was entitled to according to his deceased master's will.  Barllock informed Bibb that he had consulted a judge on the matter who laughed and said that Bob had forfeited his freedom nor could a master leave a servant a legacy.  The court room was one of the venues in which racial tensions tinged interactions that transpired between blacks and whites in Central Virginia during the 1880s and 1890s. As individual whites from Central Virginia stumbled upon opportunities to influence the welfare of a black person whose life or liberty was in immediate danger, they made conscious, personal decisions which either reinforced discriminatory behavior or called the contemporary dynamics of racial relations into question.  ","William Bibb's dilemma was similar to the conundrum faced by Judith Randolph, who lived in Central Virginia nearly a century earlier.  According to Melvin Ely in<em> Israel on the Appomattox,</em> Judith Randolph had to decide whether to obey the instructions in her late husband's will that indicated his desire to free all of his slaves and provide them with parcels of land.  Despite the passage of nearly 100 years and the abolition of slavery, the question over the legitimacy of blacks' claims to money or property left to them by a deceased master remained a topic of debate in Central Virginia.  Bibb faced the decision of taking the case and arguing against a black man's rights to a legacy that was clearly left to him in a will or refusing to defend Barllock.  By refusing to represent Barllock, Bibb could either make a political statement of his support for blacks' legal rights or simply maintain a comfortable distance from the issue.","During this time, people from Bibb's region, Central Virginia, behaved towards blacks in contradictory ways.  In some instances Central Virginians were tolerant and respectful of blacks' rights.  In <em>Free Lance</em>, Fredericksburg's city paper, the author of an obituary for Pat Boxley dubbed him a leading and influential colored politician and drayman of Fredericksburg.   Yet, Central Virginians of the time made discriminatory distinctions between whites and blacks.  Not only was Boxley a politician, he was a colored politician.  In fact, every time a reporter mentioned a black person in Free Lance in the 1880s, the person's name was followed by the marker colored.    ","Like the man who wanted to deny Carr his legacy, whites across Virginia expressed their sense of dominion, and superiority in regards to black people in a variety of contexts, according to Edward Ayers in <em>The Promise of the New South</em>.  These racial tensions haunted blacks on a daily basis by providing unmistakable reminders of blacks' inferior social status and their minimal claims to the civil rights that were guaranteed to white Virginians.  Questions concerning the legitimacy of blacks' rights as well as efforts by whites to deny or remove these rights were evident in a variety of contexts besides the courtroom.  As Ayers illustrates, the 1880s and 1890s marked the beginning of major segregation efforts in most southern states, including Virginia.  Ayers explains that southerners exerted great effort to pass discriminatory laws that governed the daily interactions between blacks and whites in the 1880s.  The struggle in race relations in the 1880s and 1890s resulted from whites' feelings of superiority and mastery over, as Ayers asserts, those who intentionally or accidentally stepped over some invisible and shifting line of permissible behavior."],"display_date":"May 5, 1888","search_date":"1888-05-05","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2015,"title":"The Power of Scientific Racism in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-11-27","end_date":"1888-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Holladay, a farmer from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, felt relieved as he read Francis Ruffin's pamphlet entitled The Negro as a Political and Social Factor.  Holliday conveyed his gratitude in a letter to the author.  Holladay proclaimed, Your forcible presentation of facts, derived from a national experiment, and from extended intelligent and conscientious observation in different fields. . . is fitted to cement the union of those whose convictions of the unfitness of the negro, in capacity and character for the position to which he is hoisted, have rested mainly on circumscribed tho' it may be personal observation.  Francis Gildart Ruffin, a planter in Chesterfield County, Virginia, wrote several political papers based on scientific racism that were widely read and distributed.  Planters throughout Virginia and other southern states responded to Ruffin's writing with support and enthusiasm.  Scientific racism involved the use of observations or data to substantiate the claim that black people are socially, biologically, intellectually and culturally inferior to whites.  Proponents of scientific racism claimed that racial differences were a result of inherent genetic or biological qualities of the members of each race.  Central Virginians, like Holliday, placed importance on the use of systematic observations and facts to substantiate anecdotal evidence and validate their claims concerning the negro's inferiority.  Central Virginians who endorsed scientific racism at the end of the nineteenth century argued that the inferior attributes of negroes could not be overcome through social experiences.","Although Holladay directly articulated his support for scientific racism in his personal correspondence, other Central Virginians expressed scientific racism in more subtle ways.  In the Fredericksburg <em>Free Lance</em>, the reporter who wrote an article about an incompetent police officer, Policeman Brace, claimed, A little duck-legged colored girl out ran him so far in a chase that she was out of sight the first jump.  In order to make the policeman's lack of skill especially clear for the readership, the reporter chose the most extreme point of comparison, a young colored girl.  The concept of black biological inferiority was readily available in the minds of Central Virginians at the time.  Other newspaper articles attributed crimes committed by black men to their childlike mental deficits, such as one man's sweet tooth and another man's confidence in his good looks.  Central Virginians considered black perpetrators intellectually inferior, as their criminal intent stemmed from the mental defects of their race instead of a fully conscious, rational choice to commit crime.     ","According to George Fredrickson in <em>Racism</em>, scientific racism was a medium through which whites, like Holliday, from areas throughout the South justified denying black people full legal or social rights and status in the late nineteenth century.  Southerners thought that the northerners' support for black rights clearly contradicted southerners' arguments regarding the inability of blacks to successfully assume a higher position in the social and political order.  In the letter, Holladay expressed his anger as he claimed that northerners had abruptly placed [negroes] on a political equality with the intelligent and cultured white people who were recently their masters. Many southerners, such as Holliday, felt that northerners lacked the knowledge of the fallibility of the negro that southerners had developed through extensive experience with their slaves.  Yet, Fredrickson argues that northerners believed that African Americans were inferior, as well.  People from both the North and South had problems granting black people equal political and social rights in the late nineteenth century.

After discovering that Johnson had escaped, the staff of the asylum realized that they needed to act quickly.  An employee hurriedly wrote a note in order to inform the Sheriff of Louisa County of the incident before he had an opportunity to apprehend Johnson.  On February 16, 1881 the employee reported to the Sheriff, Mr. Johnson, a colored inmate from your county escaped from this asylum.  If he gives no trouble he will be allowed to remain at large. . .  The staff of the asylum did not want the Sheriff to return Mr. Johnson to the facility.  ","In Central Virginia during the late nineteenth century, judges and sheriffs decided the fate of those who the courts declared lunatics, such as Mr. Johnson. Judges customarily rendered decisions concerning a person's sanity.  On January 23, 1882 a court in Mr. Johnson's home county, Louisa, declared that William P. Anderson was a lunatic and ordered the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the lunatic asylum in Staunton, Virginia.  The judges noted in the next line of the court order that the Sheriff should instead take Mr. Anderson to the asylum in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Judges sent lunatics to one of the several nearby asylums in the state, such as the asylum in Richmond, Staunton, and Williamsburg.  Virginia asylums, such as the Central Lunatic Asylum where the Louisa judges sent Johnson, experienced problems with overcrowding in the 1880s and 1890s. Judges considered which facility could accommodate new patients when choosing where a lunatic should be sent.  ","During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an insanity judgment carried a different meaning for blacks, such as Mr. Johnson, and whites in Central Virginia.  Fredericksburg's paper,<em> Free Lance</em>, printed an article about a local colored man who was sent to the jail because the asylum in Virginia for colored lunatics was full at the time.  Thus, some asylums in Virginia were completely segregated.  Other facilities in Virginia took in both black and white patients.  Many asylums in the South segregated each ward by race, in order to prevent problems. The intermixing of black and white patients in asylums throughout Virginia and in other southern states led to racial tensions, which often escalated into verbal insults or physical assaults between inmates, according to Gerald Grob in <em>Mental Illness in American Society</em>.  Furthermore, Grob posits that white attendants often physically attacked black inmates who retaliated against their white aggressors.  To keep a colored inmate like Mr. Johnson outside of the facility would have helped to quell the racial tensions that spread throughout the asylums in Virginia and throughout the South at the time.","On account of the cruel treatment and violence against blacks that infiltrated the asylums of Virginia, Johnson had motivation to escape.  As Johnson escaped from the asylum, he also escaped the cruel and inhumane punishment reserved for lunatics in the asylums of the period. Confinement in an asylum in Virginia and throughout the South during this period was in many ways comparable to placement in the penitentiary.  The Fredericksburg judge decided to send the colored man to jail when the asylum was full, as a result of the similarities in the treatment received at asylums and prisons.  According to David Rothman, the wardens of the penitentiaries utilized brute force and cruel torture methods to impose order and command deference to authority.  The staff of the asylums also frequently utilized physical force or restraint devices on the inmates.  Superintendents of insane asylums developed procedures for the asylums that instilled a militaristic sense of order, restraint, and regularity.  Moreover, inmates had little to no contact with their families once admitted to an asylum.  The conditions in lunatic asylums throughout the South rendered inmates, like Johnson, ready to leave upon the first opportunity."],"display_date":"February 16, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-16","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2020,"title":"Threat of Slave Rebellion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-24","end_date":"1841-07-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter to his father John C. Burruss on July 24, 1841, John W. Burruss asked, ...do we not dwell in constant danger, are we not standing, rather [lying] down - sleeping on a smothered - not extinguished - volcano? John W. Burruss was expressing his fear of slave revolt, a fear he shared with many southern plantation owners. In his letter Burruss described a discovered slave revolt in West Felicia Parish, Louisiana, not far from Burrus's own Mississippi plantation. An overseer had overheard slaves having a suspicious conversation in the fields. The slaves were whipped until they confessed to plotting an uprising and revealed the names of their co-conspirators. One of Burrus's slaves, Lewis Campbell, was accused of involvement in the conspiracy. Burrus seemed certain that Campbell was a key player in the development of the scheme. He assured his father that the proper authorities had taken Campbell and the other insurgents into custody."," Although the revolt was quashed, the community was left in a state of upheaval. After southern white citizens discovered news of the rebellion many immediately became aggressive, lashing out against their slaves, though not to the infliction of death. Burrus went on to note that the trial would take place in August. He remarked that though the turmoil surrounding this event would eventually calm, tensions would remain as plantation owners continued to feel the threat of revolution. Slavery had a strong presence throughout Mississippi, but it was particularly deep-rooted in the delta at this time. Whites had established plantations there long before the rest of the state. In territorial Mississippi, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, plantation owners viewed slavery as a necessary evil. Despite many restrictions on slaves, slave owners rarely enforced these strict regulations. However, attitudes toward slavery quickly began to shift. By the end of the 1830s, slavery was considered not only beneficial for the slaveholder, but also for the slave. The plantation system proved to be so profitable that plantation owners used any ideological means they could to justify slavery. In the 1830s the number of slaves in Mississippi grew exponentially. By 1840, there were more blacks than whites in the state. As attitudes toward slavery changed and the black population grew, slaveholders became increasingly frightened of revolt. "," A slave insurrection, such as the one John Burrus reported, not only threatened the lives of slave holders, but also their economic welfare and social power. The institution of slavery and the social system it created were essential to the wealth of the plantation owner. Southern whites had witnessed the violence against whites wrought by Nat Turner, a slave from Southampton, Virginia, in 1831. Other plots of revolt had also been discovered throughout the South. After these events slaveholders were continuously ready for slave rebellion. Knowing that he had everything to lose, Burrus surely feared that Lewis Campbell was another Nat Turner."],"display_date":"July 24, 1841","search_date":"1841-07-24","locations":[{"id":5781,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2021,"title":"Mass Slave Runaway from McIntosh, GA Plantation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Things were looking promising on Mr. Thomas' plantation, Peru, in 1850. He owned over 150 slaves and 15,000 acres, all of which produced great wealth in the form of cotton and other crops. Most of his slaves had been reared on his plantation alongside him and his son ten-year old son, Edward. Both father and son felt they were very good to their slaves and provided them with ample food, clothing, and housing. Their generosity was such that Master Thomas even allowed many of his slaves to own guns, boats, horses, and to raise their own crops to sell to others. The Thomas' felt they treated their slaves in a fatherly fashion and called them our people, feeling that the relations between master and slave could not have been better anywhere. Both masters and slaves even went to the same church on Sundays, although the enslaved people had to sit in the back and take Communion last. Young Master Edward felt particular kinship with some of the slaves, as he played with them and requested barbeques on the plantation that everyone enjoyed. In the eyes of the Thomas family, life could not have been better for everyone on the plantation during the planting time of 1850. ","However, this content feeling disappeared when the largest slave runaway in young Edward's memory occurred just before the crop planting of 1850. Immense amounts of cotton were due to be planted, and it was a time when the most hardworking slaves were needed. At this crucial time eight or ten of Mr. Thomas' best slaves ran away, along with several other slaves from neighboring plantations, numbering fifty or sixty in all. The whites in the neighborhood were very angry at the fact that the runaways fled to the woods and outlying areas, and were surviving by stealing crops and cattle at night. Mr. Thomas and Edward were most distressed because in addition to ruining the slave-crop ratio needed for the planting, when the slaves left they felt as if fifteen thousand dollars had taken wings to itself and gone. The neighborhood did not see the runaways as men trying to obtain their rightful freedom, but as outlaws and menaces that had to be caught. The neighbors searched on horseback and with hunting dogs, and actually saw the runaways steal a boat and flee further into the woods but could not stop them. After that, nothing more was heard of the runaways until the first of December. That night, they came back to the plantation, sought out young Edward, and told him to tell Master that they were come in here. Master Thomas did not proceed to beat them but instead said he wished them to hell and later hired them out to a railroad contractor for the rest of the winter.","The runaway from Peru Plantation was in no way an unprecedented event for Southern slave owners, and runaways occurred for various reasons across the South. The living conditions of Southern slaves varied. Many were driven from sunrise to sunset, beaten constantly, had little food and terrible housing, and were given virtually no free time. However, despite the harshness of the institution of slavery, some masters were more lenient. Many told themselves they had to be good to their slaves because they were obligated to watch out for them and care for them in a fatherly manner. Many owners in Georgia also gave their slaves rations of meat, instead of just meal and corn. Some, like Mr. Thomas, allowed the slaves free time, which many used to tend gardens and sell their crops, as the slaves on Peru plantation did. Many masters, such as Mr. Thomas did not require their slaves to work on the Sabbath. However, even when slaves were given some leniency, as they were on the Peru Plantation, their masters were foolish to believe that their slaves were satisfied and placated by their master's paternalism and provisions. ","One of the biggest outlets for slaves to express their dissatisfaction was to run away. When they hid out like the Peru slaves, and as many others did across the South, it hurt their masters monetarily and unsettled the white community. It reminded them that their slaves were not satisfied, even if it did not totally ruin their delusion of being good masters. Slaves that fled, often raided crops and joined with slaves from other plantations when running away. These characteristics of the McIntosh runaways were not unique. Another common factor in slave runaways is that the slaves often only left for a short amount of time and sometimes returned of their own accord as did Mr. Thomas' slaves. It was hard for slaves as far south as Georgia to make it all the way to a free state and it was also hard for them to hide in a community where people would recognize them. Often they returned to their masters' plantations and the most common form of punishment was either being beaten or sold. Mr. Thomas did this on a lesser scale by hiring them out for a season. However Mr. Thomas felt, it can be assumed he was surprised by the slaves running away since he thought they had such wonderful conditions and relations, but this was what most slaveholders across the South believed. The nature of the McIntosh runaway was typical and shared many trends with other slave runaways in the South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":2023,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC INTOSH, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2022,"title":"Private Beaufort Slave Sale\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Sometime prior to the first of January 1836, slaveholder Thomas Fuller must have checked his books or given some thought to his economic needs. Perhaps he wanted to make some money, maybe he was in debt and needed to get cash to pay back a lender, or he may have been foreclosing on a loan. All of these were common reasons for selling slaves in the South. Or, maybe Fuller was just trying to get certain slaves off his hands for unknown reasons. What we do know is that he put an ad in the January 1, 1836 edition of the <em>Charleston Mercury </em> offering twenty slaves for private sale. In this group there were ten field hands, six children from the ages of five to fourteen, two older women, and two infants, Anyone interested in buying these slaves was to apply to him, but Fuller was sure to add a comment at the bottom of the ad: If these Negroes are not sold before the middle of February next, they will be offered for sale at Public Auction in Charleston.","The selling of slaves, as in the case of Thomas Fuller, was a common practice throughout the South. Masters sold their slaves for many reasons, but no matter the reason, slaves were torn from their homes, friends, and often families. Private sales, such as Thomas Fuller's, constituted the majority of slave sales in the South. These sales were often from neighbor to neighbor, or at least between people who lived in the same general vicinity. During the history of American slavery it is estimated that about 1,320,000 slaves were sold locally, while about 666,00 were sold at public auction or in interstate trades. Thus, sales like Thomas Fuller's were not uncommon at all and were advertised daily in Southern newspapers. The selling of slaves emphasized the principle that slaves were truly seen as property and nothing more, as Fuller's ad revealed. He was selling two infants, who may or may not been sold with either of their parents. The six field hands may well have been married people or parents, and the children, ages five to fourteen, were most likely sold off to the highest buyer, whether they were they were siblings or not. Every single one of these people may have left behind loved ones and each may have gone to a separate buyer. That is not to say that white buyers never bought couples of families. Some felt pulled to do so as slaves used white paternalistic attitudes to their benefit, or because buyers felt that purchasing families lessened the chance that their slaves would run away. Also, some white buyers may have felt their conscience weigh on them when they made their purchases. It is not known whether Thomas Fuller's slaves were sold privately to a neighbor or sold at public auction, but many accounts show that being sold privately was much preferable to enduring sale on the auction block.","Public auctions became increasingly popular cross the South during the nineteenth century as more slaves were needed, especially for the extremely heavy labor in the Deep South. At public auctions slaves were often categorized and rated, broken down by color distinction and supposed ability to work in the field, the home, as skilled workers ect. The slaves were expected to make themselves sell-able to people they have never seen before. Spouses, lovers, families, and friends were not always placed on the block together and were often sold apart from one another. Many buyers were more interested in purchasing a certain type of slave to fulfill a certain type of work than they were in buying families (unless of course) it suited their buying needs or they felt particularly compassionate. By the mid nineteenth century, male slaves could sell for 1300 dollars or more, women for 1000 or more especially if they were likely-looking, teenagers sold for slightly less than women, and children for about half as much. Whatever his incentive for selling was, Thomas Fuller was likely to make a great sum of money. No matter where his slaves were sold, a private sale or public auction, one can only hope that they were sold to decent plantations and kept with their loved ones, although this was a fate many slaves in the South did not experience."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":11444,"lat":32.4068445137,"lng":-80.4452215468,"zoom":8,"place":"BEAUFORT, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2023,"title":"Slave Family Gets Smuggled to John Clark&#39;s Trader&#39;s Yard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1861, it was illegal for Missourian traders to sell slaves to slaveholders in a different state. That did not prevent Captain Tirrell from taking Mattie Jackson, her brother, and her sister away from their mother and putting them onto a boat headed to Memphis. However, before the boat left St. Louis, Union policemen stopped the boat and returned the young slaves to their master. The Union policemen took no further action. Mattie recalled, Their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves that go out of the city. Then two years later, seven men, four watchmen, and three traders, forced themselves into her home and put her family into a closed carriage. This carriage took them to a dilapidated prison where they spent the night. Mattie recalled that, [the] kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time [they] were before taken and returned. The family was transferred from one train car to another, until they finally arrived in Louisville where they were held at John Clark's trader's yard. The family was sold out separately, except [her] mother and little brother, who were sold together. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six weeks, and herself four.","Mattie's family was enslaved in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Missouri was considered a border state and ultimately remained a member of the Union. Historian Ira Berlin argues that President Lincoln promised to respect the property rights of slaveholders in border states in order to keep them in the Union. Thus, slavery remained legal in Missouri. As Mattie knew however, interstate slave trading was outlawed. Despite violating the law, Captain Tirrell smuggled Mattie and her family out of the state and sold them in Louisville. Many other slaves experienced similar incidents. Mattie noted considerable smuggling was done. Although Union soldiers protected some slaves from being sold to areas outside of Missouri, slave owners and traders who [pretended] Unionism successfully smuggled slaves out of the state. ","The Union soldiers were not the only people Captain Tirrell fooled while smuggling his slaves out of Missouri. Mattie stated that Captain Tirrell tricked and deceived her family before he forced them to the trader's yard. She recalled that Captain Tirrell's kindness, generosity, and approbation to the contemplated marriage was only a trap. Such lies and trickery were common among slave owners in the South. Historian Walter Johnson argues, Many sellers resorted to ingratiation, deceit, and coercion. Slaveholders told their slaves that they would not be traded and then sold those same slaves weeks - or even days - later. Other slave owners tricked their slaves into thinking they were going to attend an event, such as a party, at another plantation. Once the slaves got into the wagon, they were brought directly to slave traders.","Trickery and lies were just the beginning to Mattie's horrible experience.

H.C. Bruce was a slave on one of these farms. Many years after the Civil War, Bruce reflected on his experiences as a slave and recorded them in a book. According to Bruce, slave owners in Brunswick believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life. About nine miles from his farm lived a slaveholder named V. Harper. Harper owned quite a number of slaves, including one particular family that was respected by whites and blacks alike for their moral worth and character. In 1858, one of the daughters in this family, who Bruce described as having clean character, discovered that she would soon become a mother. This girl had not yet married nor was she engaged to a man at that time. Rather than dishonor herself and her family by bearing a child without a husband, she walked two miles to reach the Missouri River, plunged herself into it and was drowned."," During his account of the girl, Bruce acknowledged that it [was] not known who led her from the paths of rectitude. He also admitted however, that there would occasionally be a black mother with a very light-colored child. Bruce's diction suggests the slave was impregnated by her master. At that time, slaves were not considered as people, but rather as property. As property, slave owners often treated their slaves as they wished. Historian Joshua Rothman suggests, sexual contact between masters and slaves specifically and whites and blacks generally was commonplace in Virginia and in all slaveholding states. Because relationships between masters and their slaves were common in the antebellum South, it was reasonable that Bruce suggested such a relationship between the girl and her master. "," There are a few reasons why the girl in Bruce's account would have had sexual relations with her master. It was not uncommon in the antebellum South for a master to rape a female slave. As Rothman argues, a black woman's body was her greatest vulnerability. Rape was an effective weapon that slaveholders used to physically and mentally degrade their slaves. It was also a means to assert a racial hierarchy. Second, there were some instances where a slave woman would exchange sexual relations for preferential treatment on the plantation. However, the fact that the nineteen-year old girl drowned herself suggests that she probably did not engage in a sexual relationship to obtain preferential treatment on the farm. "," Though rape was not uncommon between master and slave, Bruce made it clear that slaves considered the action an attack on their honor and morality. Bruce stated that the girl decided that death was preferable in her case to disgrace. Rothman argues that in the antebellum South, a woman's honor resided in her sexual purity. The girl in Bruce's account realized that her pregnancy would bring shame to herself and her family. Instead of giving birth to her master's child, the girl decided to kill herself. With this action, she attempted to salvage as much of her honor and morality as she could."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":7480,"lat":39.5145426187,"lng":-92.9626052094,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARITON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2028,"title":"Missouri Rebels Regain Civil Liberties\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-04-12","end_date":"1870-04-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Late in the summer of 1870, Missouri's State Republican Committee addressed its members and suggested they reinstate all rights to those who rebelled against the Union. The Republicans of Missouri, taught by a sublime religion, remember that while to err is human, to forgive is divine. The Civil War had been over for over five years, but former rebels in Missouri still could not fully participate in the state government. Members of the State Republican Committee released this address on the eve of an election to fix the political character of the state. The announcement declared it was time to propose an amendment to the state constitution, granting the right of suffrage to those lately in rebellion. The last General Assembly decided by a respectable majority that the people at large would use a direct vote to resolve the question at hand. It was in the opinion of the State Republican Committee that civil privileges should be given back to those who rebelled. On August 12, 1870, the time [had] come when without danger to the state, full forgiveness and restoration to civil rights [could] be unconditionally given to those justly disfranchised."," At the conclusion of the Civil War, Radical Republicans in Missouri wanted to limit civil liberties to those people whose principles led directly to the recognition of universal manhood and universal freedom, with no paralyzing distinction of caste or of color. In order to ensure these ideals, the state government revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled against the Union. Not all whites welcomed the North's victory in the war. Missouri was a border state and had citizens who pledged loyalty to each side of the conflict. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney state that many southern whites reacted to military defeat and emancipation with dismay. These whites passed black codes denying blacks the right to vote and establishing what appeared to be a system of slavery without the name. To help prevent such measures, Radical Republicans in Missouri dissolved the current state government and created new state governments where rebels were excluded from power. In protecting the new rights of African Americans, the Republican Party thought the rebels were justly disfranchised. "," Missouri was not the only state that revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled. The national government also played an active role preventing former rebels from obstructing the integration of African Americans into southern society. According to Foner and Mahoney, Andrew Johnson's Presidential Reconstruction, offered a pardon to all Southern Whites, except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters, who took an oath of allegiance."," The time it took for rebels in Missouri to regain their right to vote and participate in the state government closely mirrored that of the rest of the country. In America's Reconstruction, Eric Foner claims that by 1870 all the former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union and that the rebels' regained their rights quickly thereafter. It took over five years, but by August 12, 1870, the State Republican Committee announced the state was ready to restore the civil rights to former supporters of the Confederacy."],"display_date":"April 12, 1870","search_date":"1870-04-12","locations":[{"id":7919,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST.

On November 6, 1863, the commission looked to broaden its mission. Five representatives from the organization wrote to President Lincoln expressing concern that the state of freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley was daily becoming worse. Under the conditions that these blacks lived, sickness and death [prevailed] to a fearful extent. The members of the Western Sanitary Commission, pointing to their contributions to the sick and wounded soldiers, asked for permission and authority to extend [their] labors to the freed slaves. With the President's endorsement, they believed they could raise large sums of money and accomplish great good. They further argued that by lessening the difficulties of emancipation, material aid would help crush the rebellion."," In its letter to President Lincoln, the Western Sanitary Commission argued that the living condition of the freed slaves was so bad that hundreds of the blacks would gladly return to slavery, to avoid the hardships of freedom. The brush tent shelter of the freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley only provided protection from night dews. The government supplied freed slaves with rations, but distribution was often delayed. Furthermore, freed slaves had no facilities of cooking, and [were] almost ignorant of the use of wheat flour. The Western Sanitary Commission included these details in their letter to President Lincoln to illustrate the great difficulty former slaves experienced while adjusting to life outside of slavery. Historian Eric Foner claims that by 1860, most freed slaves worked as poor urban or rural laborers and enjoyed few rights other than not being considered a form of property. Oftentimes in Missouri, as well as elsewhere in the South, freed slaves worked for wages well below the average wage of a field hand. This forced freed slaves to live under the lowest of living conditions."," The authors of the letter to Lincoln suggested that providing aid to the freed slaves would [lessen] the difficulties of emancipation and thus help crush the Confederate rebellion. By providing aid for former slaves, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to improve the living conditions of freed slaves. The organization argued it would not only be a work of philanthropy, but equally of patriotism, for it would remove an increasing reproach against the Union cause. Although historians Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen claim there was a heavy influence of northern abolitionists in Missouri, abolitionism was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. By giving aid to freed slaves to begin life outside of slavery however, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to prove to the Union that emancipation was both possible and the right thing to do."],"display_date":"November 6, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-06","locations":[{"id":7918,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2035,"title":"Thieving Soldiers Lead to Gunbattle\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-09","end_date":"1865-07-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a Georgia night in June of 1865, three federal soldiers sought out treasure and ended up wounded or dead. The soldiers had heard rumors of the great wealth of Georgia cotton planters. Now, with a freedman guide leading them to the house of Robert Paul where the ex-slave insisted they would find 15,000 in gold and silver, the soldiers hoped to seize a piece of that fortune for themselves.","The plan quickly fell apart. Arriving at the house, the soldiers took Mr. Paul captive and searched the place, discovering only their guide's disappearance into the night. Upset, the soldiers took what animals and possessions they could and set off down the road. Mr. Paul called on this neighbors and community. Soon, people gathered to the number of twelve or fourteen...among them many of the most respectable citizens of the county. This posse set off after the thieves, and while the soldiers had a considerable lead, they had no knowledge of the terrain. When the townsfolk caught up to the criminals, the soldiers opened fire, receiving a volley in kind from the assembled citizens. The soldiers ran, but did not make it far. One fell dead from his horse. The others, wounded and staggering, abandoned their horses and escaped into the nearby marshes. Paul recovered his property, excepting one bullet-ridden mare. The townsfolk reported the matter to the military government the next morning, who passed the investigation down the chain of command and eventually simply accepted the townsfolks' version of the events. The lieutenant in charge issued orders to commands around the city to arrest the escaped soldiers and to send someone from each command to identify the dead man.","     The military government's leniency in the matter differs greatly from the harsh, authoritarian rule of occupation armies in other parts of the South. Perhaps the military presence in and around Macon was too small to enforce order and welcomed the aid of civilians. Regardless, in the unrest and turbulence that followed immediately after the war, the occupation government in Twiggs County seems to have been remarkably willing to work with the local community, even to the extent of accepting dead soldiers. ","     In the immediate wake of being robbed, Mr. Paul did not seek the military government's aid in arresting its wayward soldiers. Rather, he resorted to a very common solution to crime and unrest in the 19th-century South - collective, vigilante justice. Despite the criminals' head start, the citizens of Twiggs County were able to spread the word, arm, organize, and catch up in only a few hours' time. This sort of call-to-arms, then, must not have been terribly rare. Indeed, even the most respected citizens of the county took part in the excursion - it seems that joining such a group was an honorable decision. Vigilantism, arguably native to America, was certainly engrained into this quiet Southern county. Long before lynching was synonymous with racial violence, communities in the Reconstruction South used collective violence to battle disturbances to the peace."],"display_date":"July 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-09","locations":[{"id":2289,"lat":32.670645545,"lng":-83.4297608837,"zoom":9,"place":"TWIGGS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2038,"title":"Planters Miss Black Labor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-02-01","end_date":"1869-02-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For the white plantation owners of the South, labor had always been a problem. Cotton-picking was back-breaking work. Always in the past, though, slaves had worked the long hours in the sweltering heat. Slavery ended, but the demand for labor did not. Suddenly the planters had the job of enticing labor that had been so simple, if expensive, to secure just years earlier. They began to question just where that easy labor had gone.","The Milledgeville Southern Recorder addressed just this question in early 1869, at the same time revealing a great deal about white attitudes. Some whites, the Recorder begins, blame the mysterious absence of black labor on the railroads. The paper counters that this is only a partial truth. The greater drain, it insists, is the great number of black families who have a self satisfied confidence in their ability to run a farm of their own, thinking they know as much about cotton making or a little more so than did their masters. This, the Recorder prophesies, is a self-correcting foolishness. A year or two of experiment will give us plenty of negro labor as in days past, it insists, adding, by that time, they will get an idea in their heads as to their ability to be planters.","     In the heart of Radical Reconstruction, freedmen across the South grasped at one of their more central new freedoms - the ability to choose employment, including the right to work for no man but himself. Some chose the railroads, others paid work on plantations, but many chose to find land, whatever the cost, that they could own and farm. Such endeavors were difficult to keep running, however, with the great variance possible in cotton prices even year-to-year. The Recorder's article show an emerging strategy among whites of using control of capital, especially valuable land, to dominate black labor now that political oppression was - at least temporarily - less complete. Sharecropping, a policy where planters would grant a piece of land to farmers in exchange for a substantial portion of the harvest, would become a common arrangement across the South in the decades to follow. This arrangement, while preserving the idea of independence and self-employment, rarely allowed sharecroppers to escape poverty. Over time more complex forms of economic domination would develop. The expectations of black failure are no surprise. Rhetoric casting black men as foolish, innocent, child-like characters who simply needed time and experience to see the errors of independence would become standard throughout the region for decades to come."],"display_date":"February 1, 1869","search_date":"1869-02-01","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2039,"title":"Bold Burglary Blamed on Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-07-14","end_date":"1868-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of July 9, 1868, the bustling town of Milledgeville, capitol of Georgia, witnessed a daring burglary.

Dragging the safe (so-called) from the backroom into the common area, the burglars forced it open, stole 500, and left without any real identification.","Police, combing the scene, had few real leads.

The other, is a large raw bone negro shabbily dressed, knock-kneed, and ugly looking face.

The Milledgeville police very likely chose two passing blacks as scapegoats, well-aware these suspects would never return to deny the accusation.","     Popular culture in the Reconstruction South cast free or idle black as drunks, thieves, and trouble-makers. This episode shows a desire amongst the authorities of Milledgeville to cast a middle- or upper-class black man in this same stereotypical role. The shorter suspect, educated and wealthy enough to travel from Boston and back, neatly dressed along the way, was a threat to some of the fundamental assumptions Georgian whites held about their black neighbors. If black were able to live civilized lifestyles when given the opportunity, it was no longer the white man's duty to look after an inferior race, but rather an act of oppression.

The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer. After burning much of the town to the ground, General Kilpatrick arrived and put a stop to the attack, though the Recorder's letter insists that he gave secret orders to burn the town after dark.","Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas focused on destroying infrastructure and demoralizing Confederate troops. With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2045,"title":"Gopher John\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-04-18","end_date":"1842-04-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Officially, Gopher John was Major General McCall's interpreter, but during those long and informal nights on the Florida frontier, John was also his cook and friend. He was someone to talk to, and he cooked a yellow perch dish that really would have done honor to your cuisine at home. McCall and John were deep in the Florida wilderness, surrounding a fire in Wahoo Swamp, and the Major General in the United States Army struck up a conversation with the young man. A dog was lying peacefully by John's side, and McCall asked him how he came to have his dog, a great Indian cur, and what its name was. He replied that the dog's name was fuse because the girl he was courtin' for a wife, and all de gal fuse me (refused me). Dis so provoking to me, I git mad. After their conversation, McCall described Gopher John as my friend in his journal spanning thirty years of service on various American frontiers.","Gopher John was McCall's interpreter because he had a special skill set of a Black Seminole, a population that is much forgotten in southern history. In describing the young man, the adjectives employed touch on his biracial connections. John had grown up from a long-legged, ill-looking Negro boy to be a fine looking fellow of six feet, as straight as an Indian, with just a smile of red blood mantling to his forehead. In addition to his physical features, John retains his cognomen with the Indians as well as with the whites who lived in the Indian country before the war. Other Indian Negroes were feared by the U.S. Army for their ability to recruit slaves from local plantations, but John was able to straddle the racial fence between whites and Seminoles and occupy a social purgatory. Major McCall had a vested interest in seeing that Gopher John did not side with the Seminoles.","The history of blacks in Florida, and how they came to be associated and intertwined with the Seminole nation, is a complex one. Under Spanish rule until 1763, Florida had become a refuge for runaway slaves, even granting them freedom for military service. Some Black Seminoles were descendants of those who fought for the Spaniards at the Battle of Fort Mose in 1738. They began to settle among the Indians who were friendly to the Spanish and remained there after Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Seminole Chiefs even bought slaves, and runaway blacks from plantations in Carolina and Georgia continued to merge with the independent communities of free blacks on the outskirts of Seminole settlements. Naturally, interracial interaction occurred-sexually, culturally, and economically. Blacks supplied agricultural produce in return for protection; they were the vassals and allies of the Seminoles.","The unique role of interpreter for both whites and Seminoles was filled by men like Gopher John. He had relationships with the two communities, but of equal importance was his relationship to Major General McCall. As evidenced in Israel on the Appomattox by Melvin Ely, absolute racial blocs were not present in the antebellum South; for instance, black batteaumen had intimate social connections with whites in the context of economics. The racial distinctions blurred between McCall and Gopher John, and although their relationship was intended to be formal and official, it became something more natural.

The Democrats went to Baylee because he needed money and because he was black. After he was paid, Baylee told the Negroes on Monday night at their meeting not to call on [the] 'constables' for help as they would cheat them, but to guess at the name, which they did.

However, even in these regions, blacks were political victims of deceitful tactics, racist attacks, and exploitation. Democrats would do anything to win elections during the years of Redemption, when they regained political control in the South. Tales of bribery like this one are common to both Virginia and Maryland, to rural as well as urban areas. Political machines provided patronage to anyone who could get out the vote for the party. Democrats also used racist attacks to secure their majority when elections seemed close. A Democratic candidate in 1889 claimed in a campaign speech, we have determined that this government was made by white men and shall be ruled by white men as long as the republic lasts."," The Democrats weren't the only ones politically exploiting blacks. The Republican Party never afforded blacks any true power in their organization, awarding them token positions on councils and token planks in political platforms. Blacks learned to expect little from their Republican allies.

There was not a hornet in sight. After planting the gunpowder in a small pile beneath the nest, Teddie focused his sunglass on the match. He retreated to the position of his companions. An explosion rocked the hornets' next, setting it ablaze. In half a second, hornets, which hummed like so many Minnie-balls, and came almost as fast, descended upon the trio. Two flew up Teddie's pantaloons. Bat turned to fly, when a hornet, coming straight as a bullet, struck him in the back of his head and lodged there... Lud could not escape the insects either.

Despite the racial inequalities found everywhere in the late nineteenth-century South, blacks and whites still interacted in positive ways in their daily lives. Teddie and Lud were excited to befriend someone who knew his way around the country farm; it did not matter to them that Bat's skin was black. Bat's old master responds with sympathy towards the plight of the three boys, and isn't bothered that two whites have a black boy as their companion. Similar interracial interaction occurred throughout the Upper South; in southern Maryland, blacks and whites worked side by side shelling oysters. In Baptist and Methodist churches across Virginia, blacks and whites often worshipped together. While issues of black and white inequality engulfed the political landscape of the South, blacks and whites could still treat each other as humans in their day-to-day interactions."],"display_date":"July 9, 1881","search_date":"1881-07-09","locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2055,"title":"In Cahoots With the Foxes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-10-01","end_date":"1878-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Fox-hunting was the most popular sport on the Eastern Shore, especially in the bountiful counties of Talbot, Somerset, and Queen Anne. To preserve and encourage this particularly Southern sport, Hanson Hiss and other Maryland gentlemen founded the Elkridge Fox-Hunting Club in October of 1878. George S. Brown assumed the Presidency, but only on the condition that no bag-fox be used in any hunt. The Elkridge Club trained only the finest hounds, and all the Marylanders knew that Chesapeake Bay Retrievers were the fastest and sharpest of them all. The club bought its dogs and kept its kennel near Baltimore, but they hunted on the Eastern Shore.","Captain Greenbury Holt always joined the Elkridge Club in the chase. Hiss would remember in 1897 that Holt, despite his four score years, is still as enthusiastic a hunter as he was 50 years ago. The men helped Holt into the saddle, but everyone knew the Captain would need little else. With a cry the horses sprung into action, the dogs barking eagerly at the scent, and the men shouting, Hi, there ... At him ... To the scent Hi Hi Hi The fox disappeared over the crest of the hill, and the troop thundered after it. The Captain's horse was a solemn and dignified thoroughbred, who amble[d] at a coon pace. He fell behind the other riders as they entered the trees, but with his vast experience, Holt knew shortcuts and by-paths that brought him closer to his quarry. Just as someone pinned the fox, the Captain burst onto the scene: he [was] usually seen at the death, if there [was] anyone out there to see him. To be so keen at such an age made the man a legend: all the darkies along the shore claim[ed] that the captain [was] in cahoots with the foxes, [he] not only [knew] them, but learn[ed] from them ... [where] they [were] going to run.","Hiss believed that the people of the South have always looked upon every manner of outdoor sport with admiration and encouragement. Marylanders considered the gentlemanly and sophisticated sport of fox-hunting something uniquely appreciated in the South, which is why they founded the Elkridge Club. Hiss wrote several articles about fox-hunting in the Outdoors journal. He noted that fox-hunting is hell without a Southern hound like the Chesapeake Bay dog. He praised the exploits of Captain Holt, a former Confederate officer. He reflected that there have always been in the North ... a class who deprecated fox-hunting... The south is luckily free from men of that ilk.

People also packed carpets, mattresses, plates, bowls, bed linens, lamps, rocking chairs, and even clocks. The annual, week-long, Turlington camp meeting had finally arrived. The big bell tolled, beckoning everyone to the benches. It was quite a congregation: almost 8000 people would attend some portion of the meetings. James Cannon, Jr. from Salisbury, Maryland, sat with this father and listened: the substance of the preaching was the same as ... [his] church back home. There was somewhat more pressure brought to bear upon the church members to bestir themselves to hunt the sinners, and stronger more impassioned appeals to the sinner to forsake their ways and return to God. People jumped and shouted Hallelujah, especially the older white men and blacks who sat in the front of the wooden tabernacle.","The next morning, James rose promptly at 7 a.m. as the big bell clanged. After breakfast, there was a time of prayer. In the two hours of free time that followed, James took the opportunity to meet different families from Virginia's Eastern Shore. At 10, the lovefeast began, with the preacher incessantly calling for another testimony, another testimony James attended religious services at 3 and 7:30. After the little children were tucked in their tents, there was one more evening service. Organ and piano led stirring hymns like Blessed Assurance and What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Despite all the preaching, the camp meetings were a mix of the secular and spiritual. At night, women traded recipes, and young children spent their allowance at the candy stand. Young men and women joined nightly promenades around the grounds. One night, James heard giggling in a girl's tent as he walked by. He entered and found the girls laughing at an old lady in a rocking chair nearby, smoking a pipe. Each time she rocked, her shadow expanded and contracted on the wall of the tent. James wasn't as amused: he explained to the girls that smoking was an evil habit. This was a lecture the girls would not forget for many years.","The original idea of the Turlington Camp Meeting was for Methodists, rich and poor, black and white, to leave the comforts of their normal lives for a time of rededication to Jesus Christ. Early on, there was dramatic revival at the annual meeting. Each year, the meetings grew more and more popular (in 1889, nearly 1,500 people showed up each night). They also became grander, finer, and more institutionalized. In 1876, the church added a wooden tabernacle. In 1891, they added a choir loft. The dresses of the ladies became fancier and fancier, and the expected time for testimonies became shorter and shorter. For the Turlington Camp Methodists, religion became more secular with each passing year. While Christianity declined in spiritual significance for many southerners in the late nineteenth century, other regions of the South still resisted secular influences. In the early years, northern Methodists from Maryland shared in the fellowship at Turlington. While newspapers reported the friendly and brotherly feeling between these groups during the Methodist Centennial Conference in 1884, the situation soured quickly. In 1885, the northern Methodists split from the Turlington Camp, fearing that the original purpose of the meeting had been lost."],"display_date":"August 7, 1881 - August 15, 1881","search_date":"1881-08-11","locations":[{"id":13591,"lat":37.9436744077,"lng":-75.3696408508,"zoom":9,"place":"ACCOMACK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition.

He describes the different regions as two distinctive civilizations, the basic similarities within each of which transcended its internal differences.

West Virginia was no exception to this. A story ran in the Martinsburg Gazette on December 11, 1866 that a young African American boy living in Chicago, Illinois was supposedly turning white. Born to two African American parents, the pigmentation in the young boy's skin was becoming increasingly lighter beginning in early childhood. Six of his twelve other siblings and his mother also suffered from the same skin discoloration. Dr. Henry J. Reynolds examined the family to try to find the cause of the loss of skin pigmentation. After examining the family, Dr. Reynolds reported that the family was in general good health and the cause of the condition was attributed to a disease known as vitiligo, which impaired the function of the nerves that provided nutrients to different parts of the body. This impairment led to the uneven distribution of pigmentation. ","This episode demonstrates the ever present strain in race relations in the South. Although the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment granted freedom to all African Americans, providing them with the same rights as their white brethren, tension still remained between the races. It was not uncommon to hear the public opinion say that African Americans were biologically inferior to the white populations. Bill Tillman, a Senator in South Carolina during this time whose political opinion illustrates many people's sentiments in the South, felt that the African American population should not be given the same rights in the political, economic or social spheres as other whites. Therefore to have an African American boy's skin color become more similar to the white population is concerning to those like Senator Bill Tillman who wanted to keep the lines between the races distinct and freedoms curtailed. "," If this African American boy had lighter skin resembling that of a white person, the townspeople of Martinsburg would not be able to differentiate him from the other white people in the town leading to a blur in race relations. The African American boy with the skin color resembling that of a white man could lead to the community identifying him as part of the white population. Socially, he could court and possibly marry a white woman of the town without the stigma of an interracial marriage. By not being labeled as an interracial relationship, the family would not be subject to the discrimination against those engaged in such a relationship. It was not uncommon during the nineteenth century for neighbors and townspeople to bring charges against those in an interracial relationship. Such charges would be brought against the couples mainly out of their defiance to comply with the public morals, and so they would be labeled as violators to the laws of the land. Some judges would rule against these couples to demonstrate the community's disgust in a relationship that crossed the color lines and would charge the couple with a misdemeanor. Therefore, in the social world, a label of interracial marriage would then cast a stigma upon the couple barring them from the normalcy of life afforded to white marriages. Not only would the couple not be labeled, but their children would be legally white, since race was determined on the mother's side. Therefore, these children would be afforded the rights and privileges granted to the white population."],"display_date":"December 11, 1886","search_date":"1886-12-11","locations":[{"id":14331,"lat":37.1249593165,"lng":-81.560657943,"zoom":9,"place":"TAZEWELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2080,"title":"Brother&#39;s Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-01-03","end_date":"1897-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was Christmas Eve in 1896. Two African American brothers, James Grubb and Bud Grubb were making preparations for the holidays in Wytheville, Virginia. The two brothers had been heavily drinking while they were in town. Bud was described as being full up when they eventually returned home. Upon their arrival to their home, Bud began physically abusing his sister at which point James tried to intervene. Bud then attacked James with a razor, James then reacted by shooting his brother in the chest, delivering a fatal wound. James then fled the scene and managed to evade police apprehension. Almost a year and a half later, James Grubb surrendered himself to police for the murder of his brother, Bud Grubb. His bail was set at 500 dollars. His trial was set for later that month, but the outcome was unknown. ","A year prior to the conclusion of this criminal case, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, which enacted the separate but equal rule for the civil rights of African Americans. In response to this doctrine, the court system attempted to prevent Southern state courts from obstructing justice against African Americans by giving federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases. The purpose of this legislation was to establish a sense of equality among blacks and whites. Potential inequality could arise in the southern states where slavery and the oppression of African Americans had been legally allowable. However, it was also during this period Jim Crow laws, both formal and informal, were enacted in the region. Contrary to previous legislation to give federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases, the federal courts from Reconstruction onward consistently and frequently decreed Jim Crow segregation to be constitutional and consistent with the law of the lands. Not only did the Jim Crow laws affect African American standing both socially and economically, but also with respect to protection from the law. African Americans were subject to greater rates of incarceration and harsher sentences compared to whites who committed the same crime."," Also during this time, community-sanctioned lynching occurred, where mobs would take an alleged criminal (usually African American), torture, mutilate and kill them. The Grubb family murder would be less likely to result in a lynching because it occurred within the family and it occurred between two African Americans. Although the outcome of the trial was not reported, as a result of the Jim Crow laws and the atmosphere of unequal distribution of justice, the Grubb brother would most likely receive a harsher penalty then a member of the white community.

He saw little or no action in the war for his first eighteen months of service, but he heard reports from members of his regiment who scouted the movement of the Confederate army. He was taken aback when he heard that Confederates had adopted the practice of hanging black men to discourage them and others from joining the Union army. Southerners were determined to punish any black man caught fighting against the South. In a letter to his wife and family in New Hampshire, Shedd proclaimed, Alas For the poor slave It is great wonder to me that they do not rebel; they would if they were not the most quiet, inoffensive race on earth. Besides expressing sympathy for blacks in this letter, he also claimed that slaves in Florida appeared to be more intelligent, to speak better English, and to be better looking than those he saw in South Carolina. To his disappointment, however, there were still no public schools in Florida where people of all races and classes could learn that all men are created equal in the sight of God.","Although many Union soldiers, perhaps even Shedd himself, were still racist during the Civil War, Shedd and other Northerners did see the many benefits of enlisting black soldiers as early as 1862. For many Union soldiers, the violent acts of southerners towards blacks were shocking and repulsive. The large free black population, their perceived prosperity and employment opportunities, and the extensive presence of Union garrisons in Key West all combined to positively influence perception of black Floridians. For Shedd, his intense patriotism, longing for his family, and strong sense of morality is what led him to denounce the maltreatment of blacks. ","Despite Shedd's belief that brave black volunteers did not deserve to be lynched for fighting alongside white Northerners, the lynching of blacks by Southerners, about which Shedd heard reports, did not end with the war, but instead, only gained momentum. In fact, people frequently extolled the lynching of black men as a way to enforce segregation in antebellum Florida. Reconstruction-era violence and lynching was rooted in the determination of white Floridians to keep blacks close to the brutal system of slavery which existed in Calvin Shedd's time.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

After describing the weather, terrain, and typical lifestyle, Dr. Byme acknowledged the differences between Florida cotton and that grown in other states but made sure to clarify the reason behind the variance. It is true that the average quality of Florida Cotton is not rated so high as that of the Sea Island, but the difference in this respect is chiefly, if not entirely, attributable to the defective manner of preparing the former for market. ","Despite the noted difference in quality, the long staple cotton of Florida sold for a high market price. This led Byme to claim that the lower quality (but greater amount) of Florida cotton was due more to a deficiency of care in its preparation for market than to an inferior product. Perhaps what Byme meant by claiming that there was a deficiency of care in cotton production was that the one-crop agricultural system implemented in Florida was problematic. It used crude, unscientific methods that left slaves incapable of working with the modern agricultural implements introduced in later years. Lacking versatility, Florida slaves could be taught little more than routine operations required in the growth of a single staple. ","In emphasizing the importance of quantity rather than quality for the Florida cotton planter, Byme was describing an economic reality of the region. When the Florida planter found that he could make an average crop of three hundred pounds of cotton to the acre, he was unlikely to bestow as much care on its preparation for market as the planter would on the Sea Islands of South Carolina where, Willie Lee Rose explained, one hundred twenty pounds was a good average crop. Dr. Byme wrote his pamphlet in such a way that clearly illustrated a widespread desire to jumpstart the Florida economy in the mid-nineteenth century. Byme praised the climate, landscape, people, and agriculture of Florida so as to prove the state's superiority over South Carolina and Texas, specifically. He boasted that Florida's seasons were more favorable to the production of cotton than those of any other Southern state. He wrote, Florida not only surpass[ed] Texas, but far excel[led] every other state in the Union.","In 1860, when Byme wrote the main article of his pamphlet, growing and selling cotton was, indeed, the most common way for Florida residents to earn cash. However, in future years, attempting to produce a cotton crop came to be a gamble for households that had limited labor resources (i.e. only had a small number of slaves, all of whom knew how to complete the same exact task).

Many did not act through purely patriotic motives, however, but to the economic fact that cotton could not be sold in large quantities, and that foodstuffs, especially corn, could be readily sold and could produce a significant profit.

He owned dogs, horses, and men-servants and maid-servants were born in his house, and the forests surrounding Jackson's plantation were plentiful with wild animals. In 1860, he and Charles Whitehead decided to practice their hunting techniques on his property. They camped by the side of his house to spend a few days in pursuit of the chase. They relaxed in the tent and laughed wildly as the negroes ran to prepare food and the little nigs looked on from every out-of-the-way corner. They sat and drank as the slaves cooked for them in one of those little disconnected kitchens so favored by your true darky cook, who, when not turning the corn-bread, stands in her red bandana in the doorway with her arms akimbo, looming as large as the wonderful fat woman in the Museum. (Akimbo is a body position in which the hands are on the hips and the elbows are bowed outward.) Jovial and relaxed, Whitehead and Jackson cracked jokes about Jackson's slaves while they worked to prepare dinner and to maintain Jackson's estate.","The slaves Whitehead described clearly lived and worked in close proximity to where Jackson interacted with his fellow white men. While most Florida slaves usually ate in their cabins, those that Whitehead described were charged with the task of cooking and were also allowed to eat supper near their masters. This led to intense ridicule and the formation of stereotypes and derogatory terms about domestic blacks that persisted for decades. In his written accounts of his hunting adventures in the Everglades region of Florida, Charles Whitehead used terms like nig and darky to delineate the stark contrasts he perceived between the blacks and whites on Jackson's property. Not being wealthy enough to own slaves himself, Whitehead probably did not have any direct interaction with individual slaves. Therefore, his perception of blacks was all the more harsh and impersonal. For Whitehead, as for many, poor treatment of slaves was a way to dehumanize the black race in such a way that negated any guilt on the part of the white race."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":1428,"lat":26.6841881812,"lng":-82.0889710874,"zoom":7,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2091,"title":"Jesse Willis Petitions to Keep Slave Families Together\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jesse Willis, administrator of the estate of Amanda Willis, asked the Marion County court for permission to sell land (rather than slaves) from Marion's estate to repay his debts. He claimed that selling the slaves could not be done without upsetting Amanda's children. Willis added, the slaves are all of one family, and [they are] mostly children which are constantly increasing in value. He did not think it was right to separate families of slaves when it could be avoided. He realized that for slaves, the slave trade was more than just a financial exchange. A one-time miscalculation on the part of an owner might lead to a life-changing sale for the slave, and Jesse Willis did not want this to happen to his family's slaves. Instead, he insisted on avoiding the separation of slave families.","There have been several court documents that reveal that there were other masters who looked out for the welfare of the slave family. Other owners, like the Sanderson's in Duval County and the Hanson's in St. Johns County, would almost never sell a slave and refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. In addition to court proceedings, slave and master accounts also provide information about master-slave relations and the preservation of the slave family. One slave remembers that he never had to do any strenuous work as long as he won in marbles when he played against slaves of other masters. His master's goal was to excite the ambition of his slaves and promote loyalty through kindness, not to depress their spirits by fear and punishment.","Despite the handful of other cases of kind masters who cared for their slaves, Jesse Willis' demand in the Marion County court was not typical of Southern slave owners. The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved. The abnormality of Willis trial shows that there were probably fewer hard plantations and mean slave drivers in Eastern Florida than there were in Mississippi, Alabama, and in other places where the plantations were great in number and size."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":1420,"lat":29.0561754463,"lng":-82.0448605922,"zoom":8,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2094,"title":"The Exasperated Bourbon\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-01-19","end_date":"1878-01-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> could not believe what he was reading. A staff member had just handed him a vicious letter from a reader that, in no uncertain terms, castigated his paper for being so brazen as to refer to black people as Mr. and Mrs. in its articles and stories. The man claimed to be one of the Bourbon Democrats, those who would spill the last drop of their blood rather than apply such titles to such a degraded, worthless, inferior race... The editor could only think that in this day and age, almost 13 years after the war that had ended the institution of slavery in the U.S., it was the man who had sent this letter who was being brazen. The author of the letter, a Mr. Henry T. Earnest, was actually claiming to write on behalf of all Southerners. The editor's first hope was that there was no truth to that claim, after the progress the nation had made; his second thought was how deeply unfortunate it was that Mr. Earnest believed the whole South shared his extreme opinion. That he even still felt there to be a South with its own identity and opinions so alien to those of the rest of the nation was a barrier to all that had been fought over so recently. He chose to publish the letter in the paper- accompanied by a rebuttal. He picked up his pen and began to draft the response. He would address this letter to every reader of The Post who might be wondering what stand the paper would take on such a relevant and sensitive issue. He wrote, So long as colored people are permitted to vote, we will feel constrained to address them as human beings...The gentleman who addresses us should have shed his blood during the late war. When the letters ran in the January 19th issue, he hoped that every reader would know that the paper stood behind progress, not racism."," The letter written to the editor of <em>The Post</em> by Mr. Earnest typifies the definition of the Bourbon Democrats as Willie D. Halsell describes it: ...a ruling group, once dethroned but now returned to power, who stubbornly hold to the past and refuse to adapt themselves to a changing world about them. Despite the fact that the war had resolved the issues of slavery and secession of the South, there were clearly those who felt no such resolution. As Miss Halsell explains, the Bourbons only represented a small subset of the Democratic party; however, their ideas would proliferate widely as the nation continued to struggle with the issue of racial equality. These ultra-conservative Democrats preached white supremacy, and fought privately and publicly (as is evidenced by this letter in the news) to defend what they believed to be white Americans' superiority over black Americans. However, though there were many like Mr. Earnest who made their racist views known during the post-Reconstruction period, there were also those like the editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> who openly accepted and stood up for the black man's right to citizenship and the respect which that citizenship demands for every American."],"display_date":"January 19, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-19","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2107,"title":"The Burning of the Andersons\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-10-09","end_date":"1877-10-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Hal Anderson lost everything on October 9, 1877. Ander son's house in Braden's Station, Tennessee, just outside of Memphis, was burned, and three of his children perished in the flames and a fourth was so badly burned that is life is despaired of. The news bulletin about the story in the Jackson, Mississippi Weekly Clarion was cryptically brief. The parents had left the children alone in the house, it ended, but there may very well might be more to the story. There was no explanation for why the children had been left alone, nor any reference to the cause of the fire. A clue might lay in the following fact: Hal Anderson of Braden's Station, Tennessee was a black man."," Read in this context, the burning of the home and children of Hal Anderson might have been another example of the sort of violence that exploded in the South in the decades immediately after the Civil War, a milieu that Ed Ayers describes as the turbulent South of the 1880s and early 1890s, when politics and economic turmoil constantly threw people into conflict. Suspicion between newly freed blacks and their former slaveholders- or, more often, between former slaveholders and transient strange niggers, as they were called- meant that racial tensions were always running high. Newspapers featured daily stories about blacks committing one crime or another, and prisons filled across the South with black men accused of all kinds of grievous misdeeds. A sense of vigilante justice, coupled with a deep fear of what blacks might do out of vengeance for a more than century of dehumanizing oppression, lead to brutal lynchings of black criminals in Southern prisons. "," While black drifters without roots in a town proved the easiest target for such violence, the constant threat of reactionary whites affected all blacks, especially in areas like the Mississippi cotton uplands and the mountains of Appalachia, where the impersonal and transient nature of work in lumber camps and large plantations prevented the establishment of roots or interconnectedness among black and white workers and families, even among those who had lived in the region for years. Ayers characterizes this inescapable fear, noting that it was a poisoned atmosphere, one that permeated life far beyond those counties where a lynching had actually taken place, one that pervaded all the dealings each race had with the other. Intimidation and terror colored life for most Southern blacks, and the burning of Hal Anderson's family and property- made suspicious by lack of detail or explanation- might have been no exception.","Episode Date: October 9, 1877"],"display_date":"October 9, 1877","search_date":"1877-10-09","locations":[{"id":12371,"lat":35.182488505,"lng":-89.8964012565,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2109,"title":"Letters By Colored Messenger \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-12-24","end_date":"1874-12-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" A letter arrived for Jerry Hyland of Warrenton, Mississippi as the year 1875 began. The letter, from a friend Emma S., commenced with the usual pleasantries before expressing dismay that earlier correspondence had not made its way into Hyland's possession. I am surprised to learn that my last letter to you, written in November, failed to reach you- I have forgotten who mailed it for me wrote Emma, continuing, we frequently send letters in by colored messenger & occasionally they prove that they should not be trusted... this must have been the case with my last one. "," At the dawn of 1875, as blacks and whites struggled in a new economic system after the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, Emma S. of Oak Lawn, Mississippi was not the only white Southerner frustrated by the new social order. As historians William Cooper Jr. and Thomas Terrill have recorded, according to careful estimates, blacks reduced the amount of work they had done as slaves by more than a third. Landlords complained bitterly. Although this particular description focuses mainly on the agriculture output of black sharecroppers and day laborers, the shift from a slave labor economy to a wage labor economy would have affected the white Southern women who had relied on black labor for household tasks such as mailing letters just as it affected white Southern men who had relied on black labor for agricultural production."," Once unconstrained by the shackles of slavery, freed blacks were no longer forced into inhumane hours or a life of servitude at the beck and call of a slave-owner. But poverty kept many freed blacks locked into the same sort of lifestyle and labor in which they had toiled in the antebellum South. Cooper and Terrill note that by 1919 most blacks lived about where they had when the Civil War ended, in the black belt. This persistence was a physical expression of the limits to the freedom blacks had secured at emancipation. Too few escaped the seemingly endless cycle of poverty that had ensnarled too many southern farmers after the Civil War. "," Whether picking cotton or doing the errands of a white woman like Emma S., freed blacks found that themselves in the same line of work that they had been before the War, only at a less grueling pace- a pace which Emma S. and other whites lamented as laziness or untrustworthiness.

On this occasion, whites and blacks of the town congregated for what was known as a Negro Party. Together, members of both races cast aside racial differences in order to celebrate the coming of the New Year. Every guest, despite their race, took part in the festivities which included feasting and dancing. The merriment lasted until five o'clock in the morning. At this event, white citizens of the town who were often divided on issues of religion and politics, came together in the spirit of solidarity to extend to the African American population of the community the right hand of fellowship. These people believed that, on the ballroom floor, both classes could come together free of distinctions of morals or color. It was expressed that many of the party goers thought that certain distinctions made on account of skin color were of the utmost distaste. Through the elimination of these distinctions, the white citizens of Jonesborough were able to show their devotion to those whom they termed voters of color.","This narrative serves as a reflection of the abolitionist sentiments felt by many East Tennesseans. Local manumission societies were established in a handful of counties in the early 1800's including Washington County, of which Jonesborough served as the county seat. Like the citizens in attendance at the New Years party, members of these societies had sympathetic attitudes towards people of color and pushed for the gradual emancipation the slaves. In 1819, a citizen of Jonesborough began circulating <em>The Manumission Intelligencer</em>, which later became simply <em>The Emancipator</em>. Historian Robert E. Corlew argues that these Tennessee manumission societies were short lived and no longer existed by mid-1830.

When the Virginia planter died in January 1835, he left his entire Henrico County plantation and all its contents to his son, Randolph, to deal with however he saw fit. As the executor of his father's estate, Randolph decided to turn his father's gift into a fresh start by selling off everything from farm machinery and supplies to animals and utensils. He also put up for auction the most valuable part of his father's household: his slaves. ","In an advertisement published in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser, the younger Harrison outlined his father's possessions and invited all those interested to attend an auction. Randolph boasted he would be selling, 60 or 70 valuable Negroes...More valuable slaves are not to be found. Along with the slaves, Randolph allowed neighbors to bid on barrels of corn, feed, oats, work horses, mules oxen, cattle, sheep, pigs, and machinery: all the remains of a successful plantation in its prime. Slaves, however, were clearly the most attractive items for sale.","For the slaves on the auction block, this event was to be expected. Once an owner died, slaves could typically anticipate their own sale, and many accounts of slaves' passage into the world of the slave trade begin with an owner's estate being liquidated. Upon receiving this news, many slaves ran away. It is impossible to know whether any of Harrison's slaves fled upon hearing the news of his death, but the thought almost certainly crossed their minds. ","Randolph Harrison's boastful description of his father's slaves sheds light on another tendency in the antebellum South. Typically, slaves entering the market were divided into categories (No. 1, Second Rate, and so on) based on physical traits, temperament, and skill. Slave traders had an interest in portraying their wares as best they could. When buyers compared nominally similar slaves in search of a few to serve their purpose, appearance could often make or break a deal.

Leaflets advertising a lost dog or runaway cat grace lampposts and telephone poles on every street corner, many including descriptions, names, and last known whereabouts of beloved family pets. Like modern neighbors across America, slave owners in antebellum Richmond, Virginia advertised for the return of their lost property as well. Only in these cases, that property was a human.","A typical runaway notice appeared in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser in January, 1835 describing a fugitive slave named Billy and where he could be returned to if found. The advertisement included a reward (20), and a physical description. At the time of his escape, Billy was about twenty years old, stood six feet high, and was a skinny boy with a dark complexion. He also spoke with a slight stammer and had a scar near the corner of his right eye from a horse's kick that had barely missed blinding him. Billy's angry owner, Eliza S. Perkins, listed every one of these characteristics in her runaway notice and demanded that her slave be returned to her son in Richmond, or at least committed to jail. Ms. Perkins even speculated on where her fugitive might hide, explaining that Billy might be, lurking about Rocketts, in the city of Richmond, or in the town of Petersburg with the hope of leaving the Commonwealth, as his father is a sailor on some sea vessel which frequents those ports...Masters of vessels, she warned, are cautioned against receiving said boy on board.","Even though slaves of all types ran for freedom in antebellum Virginia, historians have found that 80 to 90 percent of runaways were male.

Ms. Perkins' advertisement made it clear that Billy had, left the plantation of my late husband in the month of July last. After the initial escape, fugitive slaves had to elude local informants, slave patrols, and bounty hunters. The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser was hardly unusual in publishing notices of runaways like Billy.

This was of great significance because it marked the second anniversary of the Society in the city of Knoxville. At this time, the Chairman of this society declared that 15 to 20 free blacks of the city were ready to begin the process of emigration to Liberia. During the meeting, officers for the following year were also nominated and later, elected. The newly elected officers of the Executive Board were then granted the responsibility to communicate with applicants for emigration. Their duty was to instruct the applicants as of how to raise funds for the journey and any other information they might need to facilitate their quest.","Much about these potential emigrants is unknown. The African Americans in question could have been free blacks who had decided on their own accord to migrate to Africa where they could live freely. This scenario, however, is unlikely due to the expense such a journey would require. More likely than not, these were former slaves who were recently released by their masters. After slaves were manumitted, their options were limited in terms of where they could settle. Often, in order to live freely, they were required to either leave their homes and migrate to a non-slave state or travel to Liberia. With the monetary help of their former owner and benevolent organizations like the Knox County Colonization Society, this trip could be made feasible. ","Though many states and localities created colonization societies, only a small percentage of blacks actually made the journey to Liberia. Although expense was a key deterrent, other factors also played a role in inhibiting this movement. Historian Melvin Ely argues that a significant barrier to the success of colonization were the wishes of blacks themselves. Many did not like the idea of leaving behind the only world that they knew. If free blacks themselves were not compelled to make this journey, whose best interests were taken into account for this movement's justification? Ely shed some light on this question by noting the abolitionist opposition to emigration. Abolitionists believed that black emigration to Liberia was just a cover for the desire of whites to rid themselves of the burden of the free black population. Armed with this perspective, one begins to question whether this movement was as benevolent or as humanitarian as it appeared on its surface."],"display_date":"June 1850","search_date":"1850-06-15","locations":[{"id":12155,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2133,"title":"A Fugitive Slave Case in Knox County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-04-01","end_date":"1851-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In April of 1851, a fugitive slave case involving a black man by the name of Sydney was decided in the Knox County Circuit Court. Sydney's counsel argued that he was a free black man born in Tennessee, whom at an unspecified date was kidnapped and smuggled across the state line to Alabama. There, he was subsequently sold into bondage. The case arose when Sydney escaped from his master and returned to Tennessee. Sydney was found by the court to be a fugitive slave and was directed to be returned to his master in Alabama. After the case was tried, two reports were published in the <em>Knoxville Register</em> by a lawyer named Swan who had brought Sydney's suit to court. In these reports, Swan claimed to accurately document the <em>real</em> facts of the case. Another lawyer, by the name of J.M. Welcker, who had served as legal counsel to the adverse side of the case, read this report and was shocked by its inaccuracy. He believed that the writer of this faulty report had intended to stir up trouble on the subject of slavery. Welcker felt that it was his duty as a citizen to clarify the ruling of this case for the general public.","According to Swan, Phillis, the mother of Sydney, was promised emancipation by her former master in Delaware upon reaching thirty-one years of age. Sydney was born to Phillis in the State of Tennessee before her thirty-first birthday. Swan claimed that upon turning thirty-one, Phillis and her son Alfred, who was also born before Phillis was declared free, were both emancipated by the Tennessee court system. Thomas Brown, the owner of Phillis and her children in Tennessee, was, according to Swan, fully aware of their right to freedom. Swan insinuated by this point that Sydney, like his brother, was also manumitted after his mother had turned thirty-one. Welcker stated that this information was incorrect and anyone familiar with the area would have known that Sydney was born to an enslaved woman, therefore making him a slave by birth. According to Welcker, the children born to Phillis <em>after </em>her manumission were viewed as free. However, no provision was made for the emancipation of the children she gave birth to before she reached the age of thirty-one. Therefore, Sydney was legally a slave when sold to his Alabama master in 1830.","The crux of this case revolved around the status of Sydney's mother at the time of his birth. According to Joshua Rothman, the law of descent claimed that slavery is passed down through the mother. Therefore, if the mother is a slave, the child born of the enslaved woman is also a slave. This point illustrates that if Phillis was indeed enslaved at the time of Sydney's birth, then he was born into slavery and as a result, could only be legally freed by his master."],"display_date":"April 1851","search_date":"1851-04-15","locations":[{"id":12155,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2138,"title":"Adoption of an Ordinance in Marietta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-02-13","end_date":"1852-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jenny, an African American woman residing in Marietta, Georgia, desperately wanted to move. In 1852, the local government of Marietta passed an ordinance against negroes hiring out their own time or living on lots to themselves. This new law was greatly at odds with Jenny's current living situation. Jenny believed that under the law she would no longer prosper at her current residence. Faced with these unfavorable circumstances, she traveled to Atlanta to see if her options there would be any better. In the city, she encountered a certain Mr. Jeremiah who agreed to take her in on his lot and protect her. To determine whether or not Jenny could take this course of action, Andrew J. Hansell sent a letter to Farish Carter asking for him to approve of her removal to Atlanta.","What remains unclear in this episode is the status of Jenny, the African American woman who desired to relocate. It seems as if Jenny's lifestyle had been seriously affected on account of the passage of Marietta's ordinance. Her displeasure with the new law indicates that she was either hiring herself out for work or living on a lot to herself. Considering these factors, one might conclude that Jenny was a free black. However, the letter sent from Hansell to Carter requesting approval for Jenny to move to Atlanta implied that Jenny was not free to make decisions concerning her place of residence. This letter also mentioned that Jenny would have to return home if she was not permitted to move to Atlanta. The use of the word <em>home</em> indicated that her inhabitance of the dwelling in Marietta was only temporary. ","This incident shows the types of measures local governments in the Antebellum South took to deprive African Americans of what little freedom they had left to enjoy. Due to the passage of Marietta's ordinance, a free black community, like that of Israel Hill in Virginia that historian Melvin Ely describes in his book <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, would never be realized in Cobb County. On Israel Hill, free blacks were permitted to live independently and hire themselves out as laborers. Ely does note, however, that as the issue of slavery grew on the federal level in the 1850's, whites tried once again to reduce the status of free blacks down to a level very close to slavery. It is quite possible that this retrogression of attitudes towards slavery was what the slaves and free blacks of Marietta saw with the passage of the Ordinance in the early 1850's.

An enslaved African American woman of Polk County, Tennessee put an end to the lives of her children and then took her own life one September night in 1852. Authorities confirmed that the woman killed all four of her children by slitting their throats while they slept. After the gruesome deed had been carried out, she too ended her life in the same manner. When questioned about the possible basis for the woman's actions, the slave's master, George M. Garrison, alluded to the possibility that the woman may have overheard him discussing the potential sale of herself and two of her children while keeping the others in his possession. Beyond this, the owner could think of no other impetus for such an act.","Only the woman ever knew for certain the rationale which drove her to take her own life and the lives of her four children. The insinuation of her master, however, that the slave woman had knowledge of his intent to break apart her family, offers valuable insight. When viewed from this vantage point, it appears that for this mother, the possibility of a life without all of her children was just too much for her to bear. It is probable that after overhearing her master's plans to divide her family, the woman decided that ending the lives of her entire family would be less painful than separation. Based upon this speculation, it can be inferred that this heart wrenching act was committed out of desperation. ","This incident underscores the adverse impacts that the slave trade had on the African American family. The breaking up of families was not at all uncommon in the Antebellum South. Husbands and wives, parents and children were all constantly faced with the threat of separation. In his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, historian Walter Johnson claims that 50 percent of interstate slave trades tore apart nuclear families and therefore, the strength of family ties was never certain. Through examples similar to the episode above, Johnson argues that self destruction or the threat of self destruction was a common method utilized to avoid trade. According to Johnson, these instances portrayed the dark side of slave trade and served as a foundation for its opposition. In effect, this tragic account along with many others brought to light the horrors of slavery. In the bigger picture this increased awareness spawned anti-slavery reactions and eventually influenced the American abolitionist movement."],"display_date":"September 1852","search_date":"1852-09-15","locations":[{"id":12302,"lat":35.1199101303,"lng":-84.5233135097,"zoom":10,"place":"POLK, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2150,"title":"Dispute with Slave Trader\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-10-01","end_date":"1841-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1841, R. Ballard, a slave trader who owned property in Mississippi, brought a Federal suit against Henry Turner, claiming the Turner owed him 6,300 dollars. The bill was the remainder owed for forty-two slaves that Ballard had sold to Turner in 1835. Unfortunately for Ballard, Turner was quite unhappy with his purchase. He returned seven of the slaves to Ballard, declaring that they were either unsound or older than Ballard had told him they would be and demanded a full refund. However, Ballard would not take back some of the flawed slaves. Ballard refused to take back one slave on account of his being an idiot, and recommended that the slave be auctioned. Ballard also would not take back two older slaves, nor would he exchange others for them."," The bill for these slaves had accrued interest until the balance was 6,300 dollars. Turner refused to pay. He felt that he had been swindled by Ballard. Turner claimed that Ballard misled him with regard to the character and soundness of the slaves. Turner also claimed that he had been misinformed about the origin of the slaves. Finally, Turner alleged that Ballard charged him more interest than had been decided upon at the initial sale."," Whatever the outcome of the case, Turner viewed Ballard as a con-artist who propagated the plantation owners' negative views of the slave trade. Southern whites viewed slave traders as being fraudulent and malicious. They believed that most of the slaves being sold were flawed in some way, and that the slave trader was making off with an unfairly large profit. "," Slave traders capitalized on the expansion of southern territory. As more land opened up for cotton plantations, traders brought more slaves to Mississippi. By 1840, there were more slaves than white citizens in the state. The Mississippi Delta's proximity New Orleans, a major center for slave trade, fueled the influx of slaves. Plantation owners returned again and again to New Orleans to buy labor for their cotton fields. They viewed slaves not as people, but as investments. Turner's case displays this inhuman treatment of blacks in the slave trade. In the markets of New Orleans, slaves were treated not as humans, but as objects whose values could be quantified based on their age and appearance. Historian Walter Johnson calls this psychologically damaging treatment the chattel principle. The chattel principle is unmistakable in Turner's description of his transactions with Ballard. He viewed the slaves as assets that could be priced differently based on certain characteristics. Turner's case demonstrates that southern plantation owners viewed slave traders as being shamelessly dishonest and saw slaves simply as valuable pieces of property."],"display_date":"October 1, 1841 - October 30, 1841","search_date":"1841-10-15","locations":[{"id":6925,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2160,"title":"Action on the Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-24","end_date":"1863-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Walter Guion wrote a letter dated Saturday, January 24, 1863, to Miss. Bessie Guion, his sister, in Adams County, Mississippi, describing his experiences as a Confederate soldier and relaying some of his emotions about the war. In the letter, Walter spoke of a fight that broke out on the fourteenth of January against a Yankee gunboat near Lauderdale, Tennessee. The Confederate gunboat that Walter was on, The Cotton, imposed considerable damage against the northern boat, but also bore the brunt of the battle. Walter described his intense feelings of fear when he first became cognizant that he was in a real skirmish, and then talked about his surprise that there were African American men among the Union forces. In a letter back to Walter, dated February 24, 1863, Bessie confesses to her brother that she fears for his life and worries about his safety on a consistent basis. "," The heart of the Deep South was easily accessed by the Mississippi River. The river provided a way of transportation for not only men, but goods needed for the war effort such as grain. Thus, it became increasingly important as the Civil War continued that the Confederacy provide fortifications in order to protect its banks and naval stores from the Union's gunboats which often proved technologically superior for the time. As the war progressed and the Union claimed more victories near and along the Mississippi River, such as at the Battle of Vicksburg, the North was able to build up many garrisons of its own along this crucial area. As thousands of African American men from Mississippi came to the Union's aid (more than seventeen thousand by the end of the war), they began to form the regiments occupying these Union garrisons and their accompanying gunboats along the Mississippi River. Thus, it is highly likely that Walter Guion found himself fighting against some of the very men who had escaped to Union strongholds from his very own state and perhaps even county. In a twist of irony, these African American soldiers were guarding the river fortifications within plain view of southern slave owners, their former masters. While naval warfare was not the focal point of the Civil War, it became increasingly important because it was the facet of the war in which many African Americans, especially from Mississippi, were allowed to participate, and prove themselves as men, in. White Mississippians, like Walter Guion, were the ones fighting against these blacks. The emotions that both sides felt, excitement over the idea of freedom by the blacks and anger over the idea of black insubordination by the whites, fueled these gunboat skirmishes to posses a considerable degree of contempt.

He realized Elick's plan when he could not find him at night and immediately, the following day, March 12, put Elick in jail for safekeeping and to ensure he could not escape. Two days after this, on March 14, Forbes gave Elick a severe whipping in hopes of finding out all of the details about his plan of running away, but was only able to confirm that the slave did truly intend on escaping. Placing Elick in jail again on March 15 after another unsuccessful attempt at literally beating the information out of him, Forbes released him on March 21, only to send Elick away on an errand, fearing the whole time that he would attempt to run to freedom at any moment."," Whether or not Elick did eventually run away is unknown, but his plan to escape was not unique. Many slaves entertained the idea of running away to the North, prompted by news about freedom for blacks from northern abolitionists that was creeping into southern territory. The southern belief that the Republican Party was out to destroy slavery caused animosity towards the North and during the year before the start of the Civil War in April 1861, tensions reached an all time high between the northern and southern states. The controversial election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted southerners to begin considering the idea of succession much more seriously. The northern abolitionist's rhetoric of freeing the enslaved African Americans did nothing to please white southerners like Alden Spooner Forbes who depended on the labor of enslaved people to earn a livelihood. The thought that this very same rhetoric of equality and freedom was reaching the ears of their laborers intensified the white southern secessionists' hostility towards the northern abolitionists. The fear of new ideas of freedom formulating in their slaves' minds provoked many, like Forbes, to be especially harsh on their laborers in an attempt to keep them from trying to escape."," Mississippi did indeed secede from the Union on January 9, 1861. People like Forbes who depended on the labor of slaves drove this secession because they could not imagine a world without slavery, like the one they thought northern Republicans would try to create. The thought that slaves would internalize the ideas of the abolitionists regarding their freedom from bondage frightened those who depended on their labor. It was this fear that prompted many of them, in Mississippi and the rest of the South, to use cruel methods, such as whipping, to try and convince them that life as an enslaved laborer was the only life for them.

Instead, the three men were detained for six days and made to dig post holes around the jail. After they were finally released, they complained to the mayor and he responded to them that they were lucky they were not sent to the state penitentiary. The Assistant Commissioner for the State of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands made an entry to the record regarding this incident, and also when he called upon the mayor about the situation. The mayor claimed it was common practice to arrest both African Americans and white people for what he termed vagrancy."," These were not the only three men local police detained after the Civil War. There were many instances in which local authorities attempted to undermine the Bureau's attempts at racial reform. Between 1865 and 1868, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution were passed. They granted African Americans freedom from slavery, citizenship rights, and the right to vote, respectively. In Mississippi, the state set about registering black voters, and the new state legislature even included some African American members. However, the Mississippi Black Code of 1865 vigorously sought to control the former slaves. Passed by former slave owners, it provided that blacks had to have special licenses if they were not regularly employed. The acts were used as justification for detaining the three men in Jefferson, County, because they did not have these special papers, and were thus subject to the fines and jailing that happened to many like them. "," The former slaveholders sought to control the newly freedmen in a legal fashion through these black codes. The formation of the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan, sought to force blacks to do certain things through the use of terror. The Klan first actively showed itself during the 1868 elections where they used violence and intimidation aimed at African Americans to deter them from the voting polls. Their hatred spread to black schools, teachers, and churches. The federal government stepped in with the Enforcement Act, which allowed that Klan members would be tried in federal and not local courts, but this had little effect on decreasing their activity. So, while attempts were made to give the newly freed blacks the rights they deserved, an underlying hatred still existed towards them from their former masters and other white southerners.

With very little money or land of their own, they were often unsure of how or where to proceed next. A system of sharecropping thus evolved where the newly freedmen rented tracts of land from landowners and were expecting to give the landowners a portion of the profits made from the crops harvested on that land. Labor contracts were then signed arranging the details of what was expected of the freedmen and of the landowner.","On February 17, 1865, newly freed Henry Kanes, signed a contract with Chandler Sueham in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The contract allotted that Sueham, the landowner, would provide Kanes with the land and tools necessary to produce a crop, and in return, Kanes was to attend to Sueham's flock (no specific animal stated), as well as pay Sueham back one-third of the profits he gleaned from the land. Contracts like this led to discontent between the sharecroppers and landowners because they often felt like the other was not holding up their end of the bargain. Disputes arose because of beliefs that perhaps the sharecropper was not working hard enough, or that the landowner was not providing what was agreed upon in the signed contract. The Assistant Commissioner for the state of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land, reported to General O.O. Howard on November 28, 1868, that there had been many complaints filed recently about these labor contracts. The problems reported were specifically prompted by an upcoming election for delegates to the state convention that had impelled many freedmen to leave their work for the purpose of attending meetings held by political aspirants. The landowners from the Mississippi delta region were particularly unhappy because the laborers had missed several prime harvest days for the meetings, and they felt that the crops had thus faltered. "," Instances like these led to the precarious situation that Mississippi found itself in after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The majority of the newly freed people were generally unable to use what little savings they might have had to buy land of their own. Thus, they once again found themselves having to answer to a superior, who was normally a white man. The sharecropping system, originally intended to help the freed people on their way towards full independence had thus began to resemble the system of slavery that had prevailed for so long before it. The labor contracts were usually heavily weighted in favor of the white landowner, and the wages earned by the sharecroppers were so low that black women and children found themselves having to work so the family could survive. Women usually kept house for white families, and children engaged in seasonal field labor. Thus, emancipation did not eliminate the need for large amounts of labor in the South, and the labor contracts that resulted only slightly increased freedmen's control over their situation. In places like the Mississippi Delta, entire freed families found themselves working in order to make ends meet. Labor contracts gave the newly freedmen some sense of independence from white masters, but the conflicts that arose from the differing opinions of the laborers and landowners led to discontent among the majority of southerners dealing with the system of sharecropping."],"display_date":"February 17, 1865 - November 28, 1868","search_date":"1867-01-08","locations":[{"id":7123,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2165,"title":"Freedmen&#39;s Marriages\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-07-16","end_date":"1867-07-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" At the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, two million slaves suddenly found themselves emancipated from the system of bondage that they had known their entire lives. The United States was in a unique situation in which it was not quite sure how to handle the differences between its new society with all freed African Americans, and its old slaveholding one. In order to help the refugees of the Civil War, and to establish a sense of stability in the country during this precarious time, the United States government formed the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned lands in March 1865. Immediately, the Bureau found its main challenge to be that of helping the freedmen acclimate to their new situation."," Members of the bureau in De Soto, Mississippi, sent a report dated July 15, 1867, to General O.O. Howard. It stated that it seems impossible to make the ignorant class of freed people understand their marriage relations. Husbands leave wives and wives leave their husbands. The Assistant Commander had some of them arrested, and after explaining to them their duties and obligations in this respect, induced them to return to their homes and live together amicably. "," Due to the fact that marriages between slaves were not legally recognized before the Civil War, and subsequent emancipation of the slaves, the Freedmen's Bureau was responsible for solemnizing formerly unrecognized slave marriages. In Mississippi alone, more than 4,000 marriages between African Americans were legally legitimized by the Freedmen's Bureau by 1866. These former slaves appreciated the recognition of their marriages in a legal fashion a great deal. They could only be socially married while enslaved, forcing them to be at the mercy of their masters in terms of being sold away from their spouse. Many found themselves separated from the ones they loved, and had oftentimes formed a family with. "," Sometimes slave parents' sense of fidelity was lessened as they were sold away from their partners and they subsequently had no control over the fate of their children and familial relationships. Certainly not all freedmen felt this way, and there was a great deal of fidelity throughout the black community. However, many former slaves did find themselves in polygamous situations at the conclusion of the Civil War when the Freedmen's Bureau helped to restore their original families. Like in the report from De Soto, Mississippi, this caused some freedmen to leave the person they were now considered legally married to, who they had not been with for perhaps years, because they had produced children with that person. The Bureau in Mississippi tried to force these separated couples back together in an attempt at stability and fidelity. Whether or not these couples listened and stayed together is unknown, but it was the newfound stability of the living circumstances for freedmen that caused much of the instability among them because they were so accustomed to life without it."],"display_date":"July 16, 1867","search_date":"1867-07-16","locations":[{"id":7019,"lat":34.7811371772,"lng":-89.974549402,"zoom":9,"place":"DE SOTO, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2172,"title":"A Family of Slaves Torn Apart?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-04-13","end_date":"1853-04-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the horrors associated with the institution of slavery was that it constantly tore families apart because slaveholders would sell off members of black families to different and often distant locations. While this was a common occurrence, the benevolence of a significant portion of slaveholders who tried to keep slave families together is often ignored. The sale of a family of slaves by a Jacob Ruff of Augusta County to his daughter Jane Wilson provides illustrates such an example of benevolence. He sold a mother and her three children to Jane for the meager price of 1. The black family consisted of a 33 year old black woman named Lilly, a 5 year old boy named Toney, a 3 year old named Jane, and a one year old named Easter. The contract stated that the slaves were to be passed down from generation to generation indefinitely. The record of this sale contradicts the argument made by historian Walter Johnson in his history, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. One of the major themes in this book is that slaveholders manipulated slave families in order to get what they wanted from their slaves. Johnson argues that slaveholders frequently bargained with their slaves, promising not to sell the slave's family if he/she complied with their wishes. He reveals however, that slaveholders often broke their end of the compromise by selling members of the slave's family anyway. This occurrence in Augusta County provides evidence that Johnson's argument is by no means infallible considering the fact that Ruff sold a mother and all of her children to the same owner and furthermore that they were to be passed down from generation to generation.

The women of the Female Association of Albemarle County were largely upper class women who lived in a slave-based society and yet, because of their fear of violence and desire for missionary activity, they staunchly supported colonization when they might have considered themselves above such a concern.","The recent slave rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, and Nat Turner in 1831 were only too recent in the minds of southerners and had generated great social fear, particularly for Virginians.  In these revolts, slaves had revolted against the rule of their white masters and free blacks had violated the privilege of their freedom, labeling themselves as a threatening group of people who endangered the property of the South. The violence of these revolts particularly endangered white women and children who had been among some of the blacks' first victims.  As an act of self-defense therefore, Albemarle County's women joined in the intensified protests on behalf of African colonization to reduce the unnecessary and dangerous amount of blacks in the South.","Other Virginian women hoped that colonization would spread Christianity in Africa. The women of Albemarle specifically praised the American Colonization Society for its desire to plant a germ of christianity and civilization, which will spring up to bless Africa, whose fruit will sustain the principles of Liberty in unborn generations.  As Robert Johnson, Jr. discusses, these women, along with many other southerners, credited slavery as the institution that had introduced Christianity to blacks; for this reason, they hoped that the free blacks who emerged from the system of slavery as Christian, civilized beings could spread these virtues to all of Africa.","On June 1, 1830, only a few weeks later, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>published a brief letter addressed to The Reverend Mr. Gurley of the American Colonization Society concerning the funds raised from the Albemarle County fair.  The Female Association offered the Reverend a gift of 500 dollars to aid the Colonization Society and requested that a lien be retained on the funds contributed by this association, by which, at any future period, any free people of color from this county, who may wish to go to Liberia, shall have the precedence of all others in any embarkation, at least to the full amount of the funds contributed by this association.  The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported this news because the state of Virginia had one of the largest networks of colonization chapters in the United States and many would have been encouraged by their efforts.","Other states would have also been interested because during this era similar support for colonization was prevalent throughout the South.  Johnson contends that while some in the South displayed a genuine humanitarian concern for the well-being of blacks, the majority of southerners advocated colonization on account of their fear of black rebellion, the uncertainty concerning the future of free blacks, and the lagging economy. In Johnson's view the South believed colonization would protect the value of the slave property and remove those Africans who were an economic drain upon the plantation system. Thus, the American Colonization Society became a popular cause in the South but for a variety of different motives."],"display_date":"May 14, 1830 - June 1, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-23","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2187,"title":"Courtroom Drama in Black and White at Cumberland Court\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-09-02","end_date":"1834-09-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a long day of riding through the rain to Cumberland Court, Carter H. Harrison sat down to record the exciting events of the day in his diary and proudly declared, I defended and cleared a negro charged with an attempt to kill by poisoning.  Although Harrison records no further details of the proceedings, this account of September 2, 1834 reflects daily life of the local court system in the South - a realm in which blacks and whites met frequently.          ","While it is unclear whether the negro of Harrison's story was a free black or a slave, both parties commonly appeared in court and both were subjected to a legal system ruled by white men.  Surprisingly however, these white men did not always champion racial prejudice in their role as jurors.  In rural counties of Virginia similar to Albemarle, Melvin Ely notes that often times white juries had personal contact with those involved in the cases and thus, jurors tended to judge them as individuals whom they knew, not as appendages of that abstract, aggregate free black category against which legislator and editorialists aimed racist laws and rhetoric. The court juries thus ironically treated free blacks similarly to other free white men of similar social and economic standing; Ely comments on this unforeseen pattern by remarking a slaves' status as a free man, more than his color or previous condition, governed his treatment by the legal system.  The Virginia courts therefore affirmed the free black man's status in society as higher than that of a slave but failed to record exactly how he should be treated; thus, for many years, free blacks enjoyed moderate courtroom equality based on their undefined role in society and were able to benefit economically from their freedom.","If the negro that Harrison acquitted were a slave, that individual was very fortunate because slaves, in contrast to free blacks, lived in a brutal system of dominance and submission that also transcended the legal system.  Courts in rural, agrarian counties such as Albemarle had little sympathy for slaves who committed crimes against their white masters or neighbors and often issued harsh punishments such as death or exile. The courts did however, try to protect slaves who experienced excessive violence at the hands of their masters but juries hesitated to legally ascribe a slave's death to a beating for fear it would jeopardize the owner's dominance over a slave.  Therefore, courts extended minimal protection to slaves but were always mindful of their primary duty to protect the dominance of the white man and his property.  ","Often times Virginian slaves were made to appear before a called court - a court-like panel specially designed to hear slaves' cases within ten days of their apprehension. Five men sat on this panel and had the power to determine guilt and fix a permanent sentence that could not be appealed.  But the slaves were not helpless in these courts because the panel provided them with a defense attorney and required a unanimous decision in order to convict.  If a defense attorney could not be contracted before the trial, the panel postponed the date because it wanted to reach a fair decision. Although defense attorneys were often assigned minutes before the trial, they often times reduced the charges and could even exonerate the slave.  In 1832, a new Virginian law expanded the jurisdiction of the called courts to include free blacks' cases as well so the negro that Harrison defended could have been a free black or slave whose trial may have also occurred before this type of panel-court.","In his diary, Harrison expressed some disgust at the thought of having to defend people below him when he reflected upon his reasons for never seriously pursuing law as a profession.  He explained that the profession had rendered [itself] odious...by too close a contact with the vicious and illiterate classes of society.  Therefore, although he successfully acquitted a black man in court, by 1834 whites like Harrison challenged the black man's privileges because of his inherently inferior nature. But despite these existing tensions, the courtroom was ultimately a place where blacks could attempt to protect their dignity as well as a realm in which black and white interacted together, albeit unequally."],"display_date":"September 2, 1834","search_date":"1834-09-02","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2195,"title":"Charles Manigault Complains of Slave Labor in 1844 Journal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-01-01","end_date":"1844-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For at least four generations, Charles Manigault and his family had owned plantations in the Island region of  Chatham, Georgia and the Charleston District of South Carolina. In Chatham County, they invested a lot of money in growing rice, as did many planters across the lowcountry regions of both states. However, in 1844 Charles began to be slightly disgruntled with the labor production of his slaves and began comparing their efficiency to that of other slaves. Other planters told him that twelve bushels of clean winnowed rice would be average one day, but then the next day they would only get about five or six. This inconsistency was unsettling to most large planters. Manigault voiced his concerns with his overseer A.R. Bagshaw. Bagshaw told him that with the twenty-five slaves that were working the threshing area, they should get at least fifteen bushels a day. However, the week before they were only producing about ten bushels. This led to the consternation of Manigault and the overseer, and they blamed the slaves. They accused the slaves of finding ways to get around their production duties, and of only fulfilling them to the rule, not to the greatest extent. Bagshaw said that the slaves were cunning enough to remember that what they are harvesting they will have to thresh, and will tie as small sheaves as they can. Manigault tried to come up with a solution to this production problem, but Bagshaw assured him that the slaves were smart and efficient enough to find ways to get around them.","The problem Manigault had with his rice production was not unique to his plantation. In fact, it happened in plantations all over the lowcountry districts of South Carolina and Georgia. The unique rice-growing agriculture in those districts called for a different kind of labor than did the cotton or tobacco growing areas. There were limits to planter's authority all over the South, because no matter how harsh they were, slaves often were cunning or brave enough to find ways to subvert their master's plans. It was even easier for slaves to do this in the lowcountry rice area, where Manigault had his plantation, due to the type of task forces that were used for cultivating rice. The tasks were not based on time (such as working from 6 am to 6 pm) but on how many crops were produced. Planters decided what they thought was a reasonable amount of product, and the slaves had to cultivate that amount. Once the slaves were done, they often got to use their free time for other activities such as socializing, selling or tending their own crops, and other activities. So slaves, such as those on Manigault's plantation, found ways to produce the right amount of sheaves but made them smaller in size. This way, they could get around their masters orders while still fulfilling his supposed goals. Also, jobs on these plantations were more individualized than on cotton plantations, so an industrious slave could complete his day's work faster and have more free time than his owner expected. To some extent slaves could reject the clock on a rice plantation and work at their own pace as long as they completed the task. Also, not working as efficiently as a master wanted, but still getting working so as to avoid punishment, was a strong form of resistance among slaves. Slaves did not often feel personally about their work, so subverting their masters by producing slightly less was a good way to punish their owners. So although Manigault and his neighbors felt frustrated about the labor on their plantations, these frustrations were most likely felt all across the lowcountry districts of the South, due to the nature of their agricultural system and its needs, and to the cleverness of the slaves that worked their fields."],"display_date":1844,"search_date":"1844-07-01","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2197,"title":"James Cody Sues John Baily Over Slander Regarding Illegal Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-12-11","end_date":"1850-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Cody of Bryan County, Georgia prided himself in having a good reputation as a respectable Southern man. When his neighbor John Baily accused him of buying rice from a slave without written permission from the slave's owner, he was extremely offended. He considered these accusations to be false and demanded to meet John Baily in court to settle this slanderous dispute. Cody felt that Baily's remarks offended his honor and implied that Cody was a dishonest trader and guilty of buying and keeping stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He felt that his good reputation was at stake and he needed to go to court to settle the matter. He also demanded that Baily pay him 5,000 dollars in damages, a huge sum in the 1850's.",">James Cody's indignation and determination to repair his honor, seek redress, and prove that he would not illegally trade with slaves demonstrates many important principles and customs of the South in the 1850's. Lawsuits about slander and false accusations were not uncommon in the South, especially among men. This was due to the fact that a man's honor was central to his sense of self and his public image, so any kind of slander or ill talk would be insulting. Insults, or anything that offended a man's honor, questioned a man's very masculinity. Many people in the South reacted very strongly to an affront to their respectability, and would take the accuser to court. For example, a man in Prince Edwards County, Virginia took his slanderer to court, saying he would rather get back his honor than get money in the case. To those Southerners who did sue for money, such as Cody, the huge amounts of money they asked for probably represented how offended they were at an affront to their honor. ","The second aspect of this case that represented the state of the South, was the fact that the specific slander regarded a white man trading with a slave without the master's permission. Black Codes or laws regarding slaves and their conduct had existed since the very beginning of the eighteenth century, but they got more rigid and more encompassing throughout the nineteenth century all across the South. It was illegal in most states by 1850 for a slave to trade or sell goods without his master's written consent. He was not allowed to trade publicly for his own benefit at all unless his master deemed this acceptable, which some did. A slave guilty of violating a law like this was often punished with a whipping. One reason for this law was that trading and selling allowed slaves some degree of autonomy and gave them their own money, if their master did not demand the proceeds they made from their sales. It also gave them more independence and could make less interested in their master's concerns, which was something whites came to fear more and more as the number of slaves rose. As their numbers rose, so did the potential threat for rebellion or a general challenging of complete white supremacy. Also, as questions over slavery were discussed elsewhere in the nation it added to the insecurity felt throughout the South.","The result of the Cody-Bailey case is not known, or was at least not documented in the court petition record, or it may have been lost over time. However, the important themes that arise in this case are themes that pervaded the pre-war South. The ideas of male honor, the power of slander and the lawsuits that could arise from it, and of the increase in slave codes throughout the South in the mid-eighteenth century, all speak of important ideals and trends in both Georgia, and the South, as a whole."],"display_date":"December 11, 1850","search_date":"1850-12-11","locations":[{"id":1562,"lat":31.8212333753,"lng":-81.1636262055,"zoom":9,"place":"BRYAN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2199,"title":"Savannah Reverend Addresses Religious Conditions of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-05-01","end_date":"1846-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Dexter Clapp of Savannah, Georgia got word of a question put forth in a newspaper, presumably by a Northerner, about the religious condition of slaves in the South. Clapp felt compelled to write a letter to the editor discussing his opinion on the matter. He stated that much of what he had to say was probably not known in the North, but was common knowledge in the South, or at least in his region of Georgia. He spoke of the enormous religious capacity of Southern slaves and the wonderful ways they took to Christian morals, even while in the lowest sphere of society. He also commended white Christians of the South who made it their duty to spread the Gospel to slaves, and said that the care of the spiritual wants of slaves were being given more and more attention by whites. He said that while in cities like Charleston, slaves and masters were often in the same churches and he found that encouraging, in Savannah blacks usually had their own churches. He stated that this was not a bad thing, and that slaves had their own black leaders and clergymen and had independence in their religious worship. Also, he mentioned that the majority of slaves went to church; the largest black church in Savannah having over fifteen hundred members. He also referenced a free black preacher who was not only was the highest paid preacher in the entire city, but who also was immensely successful in preaching to illiterate slaves, and making the Gospel applicable to their everyday lives. He commented that these slaves were as good of Christians as their educated masters. He also claimed that the black preacher seemed to be a defender of slavery, while that may be questioned by many historians. In general, Clapp described Christian slaves as good believers who seemed to have a kind and affectionate nature, a great capacity for love, and a docile and imitative manner, which made them accept the religious ideas presented to them. His letter made clear that he wanted people in the North to know that slaves' religious needs were not only cared for, but that most slaves were exceptional Christians who exhibited many of the best Christian virtues. He made sure to include that white Southerners were perfectly capable and concerned with bettering and supporting the spread of the Gospel to their enslaved people.","Much of what Dexter Clapp had to say on the state of slave Christianity was true, although he described some of it in a very condescending and insulting way, which was indicative of the feelings many white Southerners had towards slaves. He was right in saying that there were many people, missionaries and ordinary folk alike, who saw the importance of sharing the Gospel with slaves. With the rise of Protestantism and the Great Revival in the 1830's, many missionaries made it their work to preach to slaves. Many slaves did respond to message for several reasons, though not as Clapp said: because they had an imitative manner that would make them accept anything presented to them. Although many white Southern Christians claimed dominance over their slaves, slaves could feel equal before God. It also strengthened their families and communities, which was vital to keep their society together during the terrible conditions of slavery. Also, the idea of an equal Heaven was central to the hope that maintained many slaves throughout their lives. Christianity gave slaves freedom to participate in white churches or in their own churches, where they had the freedom to hear their own preachers and socialize with fellow enslaved Christians. Even white men who heard black preachers, said they could not find more enthusiastic ministers or more emotional and genuine church members anywhere. However, some slaveholders feared that religion would cause slaves to rebel, and these whites used the Bible to justify slavery. However, other masters may have truly cared about the salvation of their bondsmen and encouraged them to be Christians. The patronizing way Clapp spoke of the imitative slaves in Georgia was indicative of the opinion many whites had about white supremacy and supposed black infantile nature, but they could not have been more wrong. Although Clapp spoke condescendingly of the docile and imitative nature of the slave, he did not know that slaves often met in secret for their own prayer groups and sermons, where they strongly addressed issues other than obedience to their masters. They discussed freedom and prayed for it, and they sang and danced, and gave way to the feeling of the Spirit. While whites may have seen slaves as docile and meek people who whites actively converted, slaves used their religion and its spread, to create new hope and a stronger culture than ever for African Americans across the South."],"display_date":"May 1, 1846 - May 30, 1846","search_date":"1846-05-15","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2201,"title":"Slave and Master Cross Ocmulgee River\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Robert Anderson was just a young boy when he became a house servant in a Liberty County plantation home. He cleaned the knives, swept the floors, and later tended to the sheep, cows, and hogs. Robert's mistress thought a great deal of him and kept him around the house as much as possible. In Robert's words his mistress felt that nothing went right if I [Anderson] did not have something to do with it. His mistress even allowed him to be taught how to read until she found out this was against the law. His place in the household was one of a very responsible and dependable slave, and this influenced him later in life. When Robert was close twenty years old, his master, Dr. Anderson, decided to move to Glynn County, Georgia. Robert decided to go with him even thought it was hard for him to leave his home. However, it did not seem that he was forced to leave, because he stated in his own autobiography that he went with Dr. Anderson because the doctor was his master and they thought a great deal of one another. An episode that shed light on at least one aspect of their relationship was when they were traveling across the Ocmulgee River. The ferryman struck Dr. Anderson's horse and they argued for a bit and then left the ferry. When they got off, Dr. Anderson asked Robert what he would have done if the ferryman had struck him [Dr. Anderson], instead of his horse. Robert replied vigorously that he would have knocked the ferryman into the water. His master replied thankfully, and pledged that since they were in a strange county now he would make sure to also defend Robert whenever necessary. He firmly stated he would not let anybody take advantage of Robert. Thus on the banks of the river, they pledged themselves to one another and remained so until he [Dr. Anderson] departed this life.","It may seem surprising that a slave and his master seemed truly fond of one another, when in many cases slavery was brutal and did not seem to have a warm, emotional side to it. However, it is important to remember that many masters told themselves it was their duty to take care of their slaves and to be fatherly caretakers. Also, it is important to remember that Robert, and other house slaves, were in close proximity to their masters for most of the day, if not night. This obviously led to some sort of bond, though unequal, to their master and mistress. White women and children across the South often became very attached to their household slaves- people who cleaned for them, nursed them, and raised them. Field slaves often would not have enjoyed this privileged or warmer relationship with their masters. Even though the slave-master relationship was in no way equal, and whites would not like to admit it: both masters and slaves (especially house slaves or slaves on smaller plantations) depended on one another, and were more intimate than one would guess. Both Dr. Anderson and Robert probably felt safer together with someone they had known for decades, since they were in a strange new county. Of course their relationship was imbalanced, as all master-slave relationships were, but it was obvious in many cases that slaves were a form of comfort to their masters. Many slaveholders felt that their slaves were their own people and sometimes had a degree of sentimental feelings towards them. Many whites felt that they really knew what was best for their slaves. Slave-owners often defined themselves by their slaves and whether this brought about a semi-good or bad relationship, it brought out a relationship nonetheless. No matter how unequal the relationship was and no matter how rare it was for slaves and masters to have this affection for one another, his fondness for his master and his master's apparent fondness for Robert made a lasting impression on the future Reverend Robert Anderson for the rest of his life. He was not the only slave in the South who had a more positive relationship with his master than many people would have believed was possible, but it is still important to remember the brutal aspects of slavery, and that even these positive relationships were still not equal or just."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":1836,"lat":31.0887336961,"lng":-81.4509546531,"zoom":9,"place":"GLYNN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2207,"title":"Fighting in the Schoolyard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-01-10","end_date":"1873-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The schoolyard of the Colored Academy at Pine River was alive with excitement on the afternoon of the tenth of January, 1873. George Green, a sturdy young man of around eighteen years, attempted to kiss the little bronze beauty Roberta. When Professor Thomas Henaforth discovered what had transpired outside of his school, he set out to punish the mischievous youth. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Professor found Green and hit him over the head with a heavy cudgel, inflicting several open, bleeding wounds. The battle seemed to be a clear victory for the Professor until later that day when Green attacked him as he exited the building. Green triumphed in this round, beating Professor Henaforth until he yelled Nuff.","R. E. Porter, the Staunton Spectator's editor, drew four conclusions from this incident. Young darkies should take care in their efforts to kiss girls at school, as only the professors may claim this benefit. Schoolteachers should mind how they try to discipline the older male students since the stronger will win out in the battle. Women are responsible for all disobedience as they lead others into temptation. Finally, Porter suggested that if it had been a white professor assaulting a black student the incident would have gained much greater publicity, but since it occurred among individuals of the same race, it is not as notable."," Implicated in this incident are the state of the school systems in the Reconstruction South and the quality and character of race relations. The historian Eric Foner describes how public education collapsed during the Reconstruction as a result of widespread tax cuts, sinking to the point that a state governor considered it a luxury. Black students endured the worst of this educational ruin, but their situation was markedly better than it had been during slavery when education was altogether forbidden. The difference in the quality of education and the creation of a Colored Academy to separate the races revealed the tension between the black and white populations. The language used by Porter to describe those involved in the fight supports Foner's argument for the beginnings of the system of racial subordination, especially in Porter's description of Green as the brawny young Buck whose muscles have been developed at the plough handle and the anvil. White southerners still saw African Americans in terms of their roles during slavery, despite the new constitutional amendments guaranteeing equal rights. Although positioned as a professor at an educational institution, Porter impugned Henaforth's qualifications by suggesting sexual relations between a teacher and his students and placing Henaforth's title in quotations (Professor). Though the fifteenth amendment said it must be so, blacks were still not equal to whites in the eyes of the inhabitants of Augusta County."],"display_date":"January 10, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-10","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2212,"title":"A Jealous Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-08-18","end_date":"1884-08-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["   The possessive feelings that accompany jealousy occasionally lead to violent actions, as in the case of Elzy Middlebrook. On a Saturday evening Elzy Middlebrook was arguing with Thomas Brown outside the house of Wilson Goings, the father of Middlebrook's wife. Middlebrook accused Brown of being overly familiar with his wife, showing jealousy to be the source of the conflict that emerged. Wilson Goings, after listening to the quarrel outside his home, asked Brown inside. Middlebrook's wife was in the house and when Middlebrook was denied entry to the residence he became furious and tried to force his way inside. He managed to open the door enough to fire his pistol and hit Goings, resulting in a severe arm wound. Middlebrook then made his way to another door, gained entrance, and fatally wounded Brown.","   Elzy Middlebrook was arrested on Sunday morning without any attempt at escape. He was indicted on Monday for murder and malicious maiming, all a result of his suspicious love for his wife, barely mentioned throughout the article. The Valley Virginian specifically indicates that all of the parties involved [were] colored.","   The newspaper's report on the race of the individuals involved in the crime is essential to understanding its significance. It is an assertion that violent actions of this sort occur only within a certain set of people, implying that white Americans could rise above such crimes of passions. While under slavery Middlebrook was obliged to accept his wife's sexual contact with men other than himself due to his subservience under his master, his new freedom granted him the liberty to defend what he believed should be rightfully his. The wife becomes a question of property, evident in her absence in the reporting of the incident, and Middlebrook had a right to his property. Steven Hahn contends that the South following the Civil War was formed out of black struggles such as this one, illustrating the nature and complexity of race relations in the nineteenth century. The racial identification is indication of a level of racial prejudice, but the Middlebrook's indictment and trial indicate the due process of law given to every criminal regardless of race.

They believed they had found it in the Old Testament with the Curse of Ham in Genesis 9:25-27. Cursed be Canaan The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers...Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem May Canaan be the slave of Shem. These southerners believed that Canaan had settled in Africa, and that his descendants had become black. Thus, slavery was the natural order of life, and because of this belief, many people were alarmed at the growing number of new religions preaching equality among the races. In the mid 1800s, Evangelicalism began in small groups and then began to gain its foothold in the South where it eventually formed several denominations (Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterian). The Methodists emerged out of these groups as staunch believers that slavery was wrong, and this ideal held well into the nineteenth century. "," Methodism was founded by John Wesley of New England, and was based on a premise that there was a method of coming to God. It quickly spread throughout the entire new world, particularly the South, where classes were conducted where people shared their innermost feelings with each other. In these classes, traditional boundaries of class, race, and sex were bridged. The Methodist preachers (along with the other Evangelical religions' preachers) began to travel throughout the South exclaiming the word of God. The Methodists, as well as other Evangelicals, became the enemy of the southern slave owners because of their anti-slavery stance, as well as their belief that women and African Americans were equal to white men. Slave owners felt that if the slaves internalized these ideals of freedom and equality, there would be a greater risk of slave revolts and general discontent within the system of bondage."," Leading up to and during the Civil War, many Methodists used their religious beliefs as justification for desiring to beat the Confederacy. When the Union won the war, and the slaves were emancipated, religious newspapers exclaimed about the Christianization of African Americans across the country. In a letter dated November 13, 1865, from Reverend W.H. Watkins in Washington, Mississippi, to the Philadelphia newspaper The Christian Recorder, Watkins told of the desire of the Methodist Church to educate African Americans in the teachings of Christ. He stated, It is the purpose of the Church, to whom the colored people are mainly indebted for all they know of Christianity, to supply the missions as formerly, where our ministry is desired, and where the people show a willingness to support it...We have shown ourselves friend of the Negro, and the Church will not abate any of its efforts to teach him the way of salvation...The Mississippi Conference resolves to promote the education of the rising generation. "," Methodists like Reverend Watkins still desired to promote Christ in the lives of African Americans throughout the South after the Civil War. They felt it was necessary to keep promoting the ideals of equality among all Americans, especially after emancipation. Because the nation had lived with such an unjust institution for so long, they knew these feelings of social inequality would not disappear overnight, and therefore resolved to try to dissolve them."],"display_date":"November 13, 1865","search_date":"1865-11-13","locations":[{"id":7319,"lat":33.2603630837,"lng":-90.841504364,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2264,"title":"Attack of Mrs. Yeakle and Lynching of John H.

A group was organized to track him down. ","Although the man was first considered to be George Parish (an at-the-time, recently released convict), John H. Bigus was charged with the assault. On November 23, at around 1:30 A.M., a masked mob raided the prison against the sheriff's will and took Bigus. He maintained his innocence, blaming instead another African American, Joe Hall. The mob hung Bigus from a tree about a quarter of a mile from where he had been jailed. Bigus asked if he could pray before being hanged and the gang allowed him to do so. After hanging him, they shot him three times.","The lynching of John H. Bigus was one of many throughout the South, before and after 1887. As historian W. Fitzhugh Brundage argues, the reasons for lynching at the end of the nineteenth century were many and varied, depending on economic, political and social factors. Lynching occurred over whipping and beating when the social order of white society was attacked. The example Brundage uses to support this is the assault of a white woman. Bigus' case shows how such an act would not be permitted. The perpetrator of the act was in question. Three different men were implicated throughout the ordeal: George Parish, John H.

His master, along with other planters, sent their slaves, including Northup, south to St. Mary's Parish to hire themselves out on the sugar plantations where labor was needed and wages were high. Northup was hired out to a Judge Turner who lived on the Bayou Salle. After being given several different tasks, Northup was put in the sugarhouse. He acted in the capacity of driver; he was given a whip and told to use it on anyone who was idle. If he failed to do so, he would be whipped himself. The process of sugar making continued day and night; Northup had no regular times to rest and got little sleep. ","One advantage to working in the sugarhouse was that Northup was paid for some of his work. Louisiana custom mandated that a slave retain whatever compensation he may obtain for services performed on Sundays; this money allowed him to buy necessary articles such as utensils to cook with. To ask for these seemingly everyday and inconsequential things would have ended in laughter, a kick, or even a whipping from the master according to Northup's autobriography, <em>Twelve Years A Slave. Narrative Of Solomon Northup.</em> In the book, Northup also points out that however injurious to the morals, it [was] certainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave, to be permitted to break the Sabbath and be able to purchase everyday items. Northup earned 10 in Sabbath money. He added to this by playing his violin at a party given by one of Judge Turner's neighbors. He ended up with 17, which he took great pleasure in counting. He would spend his time dreaming of the water pails, pocket knives, new shoes and coats and hats and other everyday items that he would be able to buy. He also took great pleasure in being the wealthiest slave on the Bayou Boeuf when he returned home in January of 1846."," On a sugar plantation, such as Northup worked on, labor was almost continuous. Planting began in January and ended in March; cultivation began in March and lasted till July. Farm chores were done until grinding began in October. During the grinding season a mill would run almost nonstop from early Monday morning until noon on Saturday. It required work and constant supervision, and those chosen both to accomplish and oversee the task, like Northup, got little to no rest. Sometimes slaves were even required to work on the Sabbath, but, as in the case of Northup, slaves were usually paid for the work they did on this day usually reserved for rest. ","Throughout the South, planters of all types of crops often hired slaves from other plantations to provide extra help. Slaves' owners, as in Northup's case, sometimes hired out their slaves to other planters; in this situation the slave's master would usually take at least some of the money the slave earned in the job. Slave owners also found it profitable to hire slaves out to industry, such the lumber industry, or to the state for public works projects. Sometimes slaves were able to hire themselves out, meaning they could keep their own earnings. After the slave received his or her money, then that slave was free to spend it. Slaves often spent what little money they were able to make on providing themselves and their families with extra food and clothing. They could also buy small luxuries such as furniture.","Northup had not grown up having to spend endless hours working fervently in a hot sugar-grinding mill, nor did he grow up having to work on Sundays or play his violin at parties just to earn money to buy the few necessities of life. Northup had been born a free man but was kidnapped in 1841 while visiting Washington, D.C. He was drugged, threatened with death, and then put on a boat to New Orleans where a slave dealer sold him into slavery. His story, though unusual, was not unique. Not all African Americans sold in the slave yards were born into slavery; some where free men and women who had been kidnapped and sold South where they would be unable to escape or solicit help. Free African Americans were kidnapped from all over the United States in the nineteenth century. They were kidnapped from within the South. Three generations from one free African American family were kidnapped from Point Coupee, Louisiana, and sold in New Orleans. They were kidnapped in the Midwest; a free African American named John Merry from Illinois was arrested in St. Louis and sold in New Orleans. Northup himself was from New York in the North. Some of these kidnapped men, including both Northup and Merry, were able to get friends from the North to help them win back their freedom, but others did not always have friends who could help. Whether or not they were able to escape, they had to grow accustomed, for at least a little while, to being a piece of property who had been bought and paid for and who had to struggle though long hours of hard work for which they usually received no pay."],"display_date":"1845 - 1846","search_date":"1845-12-31","locations":[{"id":5713,"lat":29.8296521317,"lng":-91.9512085468,"zoom":9,"place":"ST MARY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2289,"title":"Bradley Tyler Johnson&#39;s Woodlands\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-08-21","end_date":"1899-08-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1899 Bradley Tyler Johnson posted a flyer titled For lease on Ninety-Nine Year Terms that advertised a 99-year lease on his property, the Woodlands, located in Amelia County. Johnson had a very specific vision for the property; I want a colony of ten families from the Northwest to settle here, he wrote. Traditionally Southside Virginia, including Amelia County, had a rural background with very few towns of any size. In both the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until the end of slavery, Southside Virginia had borrowed from the Chesapeake region the tobacco economy based upon slave labor, only lacking the wealth and sophistication. Johnson knew that the area would not attract those seeking great wealth, so he aimed his advertisement towards families committed to a rural lifestyle.","Bradley Tyler Johnson promoted the property through its location and land attributes. First, Johnson advertised on his flyer that the Woodlands was located only two and a half miles from the Amelia County Courthouse and 36 miles southwest of Richmond by the Southern Railroad. Other benefits the property based on its location included receiving mail twice a day, two newspapers - one from Baltimore, Maryland and the other from Washington, D.C., and telegraph service. Next Johnson went into detail in describing the many land attributes such as the red clay soil, the alluvium river bottoms, the oak forest, and plentiful streams and springs. He said that the Uplands have never been ploughed since the flood 'Before the Wah'. I suppose they were scrathed for an inch to an inch and a half, in depth by a mule and a n----r, but below that depth has never been stirred by the hand of man, and is just as virgin, as the morning Noah landed on Arabat. Johnson made plans to divide the Amelia County land into farms of 150 acres each and suggested that the settlers grow orchards of apples, grapes, pears, plums, and cherries.","Although it was not entirely clear whether Johnson would have leased the land to sharecroppers, sharecropping was a very common practice during and after Reconstruction. Sharecropping was leasing land to families who would pay their rent by giving the owner a portion of the crop grown on the land. During Reconstruction not only freedmen and women but also poor whites without land practiced sharecropping in Virginia. The practice continued strongly after Reconstruction especially in rural areas formerly based upon the labor of slaves such as the tobacco farms in Amelia County. Sharecropping exploited the people who worked the land by charging high interest rates on borrowed goods and by demanding large portions of their crop. Plantation owners in rural areas found themselves without labor after the Civil War and the practice of sharecropping helped to alleviate the burden of labor.","Johnson was a wealthy man who owned land in Amelia County while spending much of his time in his Richmond, Virginia home. He had a strong desire to lease his land to a colony of families who are neighbors and friends at home and would be so in a new country instead of Virginia locals who were likely to be freedmen and women. It is clear from the language of the advertisement that Johnson only planned to lease the land to white families based on a discussion of black labor and the use of derogatory, racist language. Johnson told the story of rural farmland and woodland where a family could find happiness but not riches instead of telling the story of sharecropping and how difficult life could be."],"display_date":"August 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-08-21","locations":[{"id":13617,"lat":37.3359551661,"lng":-77.9760581709,"zoom":10,"place":"AMELIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2290,"title":"The Murder of Mrs. Harris \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-12-25","end_date":"1854-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["n the day of the murder, Ben Small kept watch in the yard for Isidore. Isidore knew that Mrs. Henry would never let Small in the house, so he had to commit the crime. After the murder, one of the men set fire to the house. Ben worried about the children who were asleep in the house at the time. ","This won't do, the children will be burned; let us wake them or put the fire out, Small reportedly said. ","No, Isidore replied. So much the worse for them. Let them burn, they will tell no tales. ","H.B. Trist of Bowden Plantation wrote to his daughter Willie in New Orleans on Christmas Day, telling her of the incident. Small had confessed to being an accomplice in the premeditated murder of Isidore's white mistress Mrs. Henry, and Trist's account of the murder came from the confession. This accounts, perhaps, for the story of Small's attempt at heroism when he reportedly wanted to save the children; it is possible that Small lied in order to save his own neck. It is unlikely he was capable of much heroism as he was also mixed up in the murder of two white whiskey sellers in the area. It is unclear if Small was a slave on the Marchand plantation or another plantation or if he was a free man. ","Trist found Isidore's betrayal of his mistress with whom he had grown up the most disturbing part of the confession. He thought that since Isidore had been raised together with Mrs. Harris and since she had always been kind to him this made his villainy even worse than Small's. ","In expressing his distress that Isidore could murder a woman whom he had grown up with and who had apparently always been kind to him, Trist was showing that he, like slaveholders throughout the South, subscribed to the doctrine of paternalism. Paternalism was a defense of slavery in which slaveholders claimed that they treated their slaves well and took care of them by providing them with food, clothing lodging, and religion. Slaveholders thought slavery to be a type of parent/child relationship where the slaveholder took care of the slave and the slave was grateful and content to be looked after. ","But Mrs. Harris' murder shows an instance where African Americans were obviously not content and thus showed an active resistance to their enslavement. According to historian Kenneth Stampp, slaves thought of their enslavement in terms of labor extortion and a lack of control over their own time and labor. They would play along with the slaveholder's illusions that they as slaves were helpless, because not to do so might anger their owner and end in some form of punishment by the owner. Slaves struggled against their forced servitude in many ways. Some were careless in their work. Some slaves sabotaged themselves to make themselves unfit for work. Stampp reports on one Kentucky slave who would purposely make himself sick by overdosing on medicines he found in his master's medicine chest. One of the more extreme steps a slave could take to resist enslavement was to run away. This was a dangerous step; runaway slaves usually were caught and brought back to the plantations where they were usually publicly punished as a warning to other potential runaways. A most extreme form of resistance was murder. Slaves murdered both overseers and owners for different reasons. Usually it was because the slave felt he had been treated badly or punished unfairly. According to Stampp, violence was usually only adopted by the most extremely discontented of the slaves. Many states had Black Codes to deal with slave violence. Louisiana's Black Code ordered that a slave be given a trial; if convicted, the slave was either sent to prison or, as was most common in the South, executed.

She then awaited a hearing.","Although Louisa Kerling is not specifically called white, it can be assumed by the fact that in the newspaper, Elizabeth Burley's color was identified while Louisa Kerling's was not. The arrest of Burley, a relatively young girl, for fighting with and stealing the small sum of fifteen cents from Kerling, seems an overreaction. Historian Edward Ayers says that whites believed blacks held white law in contempt and that black crime was on the rise. In the late eighties, arrests and sentences of black men went up. Not only did whites perpetuate the belief of the dangerous black man but so did newspapers. Although Burley was young and a girl, this does not mean she would not be implicated in the increasing suspicion and fear of blacks. While the reaction to Burley's theft may be explained by a heightened fear of blacks committing crimes, it may also simply be a normal reaction to stealing.","The Sun published other articles of thievery in January of 1878.

Therefore, it was up to the white citizens of Culpeper County to curtail the economic activity that encouraged the disorderly conduct and upsetting the balance that so delicately permeated life in slave holding society.

Additionally, the petition revealed that whites were participating in the moral debauchery as well. In fact, they apparently facilitated it.

Many went to the free states of Ohio or Pennsylvania. However, several petitions made by the residents of Loudoun County reveal that the newly freed blacks were often inclined to stay in Virginia. As the petitions disclose, they received both support and some resistance from their neighbors in Loudoun County.","In 1848, thirty-nine petitioners requested the help of the state legislature in permitting William Watson to remain in Virginia. Watson had been emancipated by his owner and had proved a man of good character, of industrious habits, charged with the support of large family. Additionally, the petition stated that Watson was a convenient and useful person to [the] community in the capacity of a day laborer. A similar petition, signed by 93 residents, was written in Leesburg in 1850, requesting that Harriet Cook, a free black, be permitted to live in the state. The document stated that she possessed a high character and was a valuable member of Society. The petitioners elaborated on her value to their lives when they explained that she provided laundry services to many in the town and her loss would be a great inconvenience.","Despite these petitions, not every citizen in Loudoun County supported the residence of William Watson and Harriet Cook. A 1850 petition asked that the two free blacks be removed from the county and that the law should serve as the remedy in such cases where it ought to be in the city and county courts. Twelve residents of the county put petition. As pointed out by the historian Joshua Rothman, Virginia law required free blacks emancipated after 1806 to leave the state permanently within one year of manumission, unless they received a petition from the state legislature. While some fought to keep their families together and retain the already mangled pieces of their lives, Rothman states others made the difficult move and left a state that didn't want them anymore. That didn't want them while they were free. As the above-mentioned petitions demonstrate, some freed slaves received help from their white neighbors in their fight to stay in the state. This situation reveals, that in race relations, whites did not act like whites were supposed to act and blacks did not act like blacks were supposed to act, when personal relationships complicated the idea of stark racial divides. However, while some in Loudoun County thought the presence of Billy Watson and Harriet Cook proved good, in fact somewhat essential, for community life, others thought it necessary that they leave."],"display_date":"1848 - 1850","search_date":"1849-07-01","locations":[{"id":14002,"lat":39.0907154711,"lng":-77.6357306744,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUDOUN, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2338,"title":"Alexander Allen&#39;s Essay on Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Alexander Allen was asked to write an essay on the Advantages and Disadvantages of Slavery at Franklin College, Alabama, which he attended during the late 1830s and early 1840s, his answers were based upon the society in which he was immersed for all of his life. First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2340,"title":"John Dewery in Prison\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-07","end_date":"1836-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Dewery, a bright mulatto...nineteen or twenty years old, found himself in a precarious situation. As he was sitting in the Clark County Jail in Alabama on January 7, 1836, the Mobile Commercial Register published an announcement about his capture and arrest as an escaped slave. This was problematic because he swore in vain that he was a freed person. Nevertheless, the paper reported that if his owner would not come to reclaim his property, he will be delt with as the law directs.","If this young mulatto boy was currently or at any point a slave, that means he was the child of a sexual relationship across the color line in which an enslaved mother was the partner of some white male. This is evident because southern state laws established that children of any mixed relationship would follow the status of their mother, regardless of who their father might be, keeping them enslaved on the plantation. Of course, this gave white male slave-owners the opportunity to freely engage in elicit sexual relations with their female slaves without fear of the repercussions of unwanted, illegitimate children as these children would still be classified as their slaves. According to Joshua Rothman, such occurrences fed to the complexities and contradictions of a southern society founded on racial domination-which some sexual relationships could only serve to reinforce-and alternately undermined by interracial sex.","On the other hand, it is possible that this young boy was not a slave nor was enslaved ever in his past. Because of the maternally-inherited status-which meant slaves who had a white father were still born as slaves-on which the southern plantation functioned, some mulattos were free while some, born of enslaved mothers, were still slaves. In other words, an individual's physical appearance essentially gave no indication of being free or enslaved. Therefore, many slave traders kidnapped and sold free blacks who were not slaves at all. Notably during the fall months, when planters had money from the sale of their crops, slave traders in Alabama took such illicit action in order to make their own profit. Within the interstate slave trade, numerous free blacks and mulattos were arrested under the assumption that they were escaped slaves and then allowed to be sold simply because traders could presumably legitimize this through the color of their skin. As John waited in his prison cell in Clarke County, his fate was more than likely to be sold in order for the county to pay for jail fees-an embodiment of unpredictable and often times tragic outcome of sex across the color line."],"display_date":"January 7, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-07","locations":[{"id":77,"lat":31.6619891322,"lng":-87.8428758708,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2341,"title":"Sylvia, the Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-09-30","end_date":"1836-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1836, Sylvia, about twenty years of age, of common size, very likely and almost black, was sold from her plantation in Conecuh County, Alabama to the plantation of Thomas L. Stark in Washington County. Perhaps she was separated from her husband. Perhaps she left behind a child. Whatever the circumstances, Sylvia decided to run away. After several months with no sign of Sylvia, her owner finally decided to make a more public announcement. On September 30 of that same year, the Mobile County Register published a 10 reward pending the return of this runaway slave. Sylvia's rightful owner expected her to return to her former plantation in Conecuh County and whomever she missed there.","Across the South, the domestic slave trade daily uprooted slaves from their homes and dropped them into some foreign land without regard for their personal well-being. Of all the interstate slave sales leading up to the Civil War, twenty-five percent destroyed first marriages and fifty percent destroyed nuclear families. Essentially, slaves were property, and property could be bought and sold at will-whatever was economically profitable. With this in mind, the families of slaves were always in danger of being separated.","Sylvia's new master, Thomas L. Stark, valued the young girl enough that he provided a reward for her return. Slaves were vital to the livelihood of the southern plantation owner. As William Rogers explains, slavery was a crucial part of the Cotton Kingdom in Alabama and inherently tied to the economic success of planters as their most valuable asset. Therefore, Mr. Stark valued Sylvia as one of the highest commodities in his fortune-one that he could not let run away.","Surely, Sylvia knew that punishment was awaiting her upon her return. In Alabama, most small infractions were handled on the plantations, while more serious crimes were handled within the legal system. Essentially, corporal punishment was a way for white southerners to demonstrate their power and keep the system of slavery functioning to their advantage. Even though slaves were property, they were still people who needed disciplining to keep within the lines of the owners' will.

Numerous family letters focused on health. In this correspondence, the first paragraph tended to discuss the health of all members of the family and the history of any sicknesses since the last letter. The Forwood family was generally in sufficient health, despite a fever here and there. However, in this letter, Sam chose to include the conditions of his slaves. He wrote, My family is in good health except one negro woman and a little negro boy over two years old. The black woman had been plagued by a slight fever, and the young slave boy had broken a bone rough-housing with some of the other slave children. Following this mention, Sam continued his letter with the normal discussion of his cotton crop and other business around Clark County.","This is not an exception in the history of southern slavery. Slave owners often included slaves as a part of their household. As Edward Ayers points out, in most instances, masters and slaves mutually cared for one another, and masters would grieve for slaves as a member for the family. Because the idea of family was so important in the southern Christian culture, masters frequently included their slaves in their notion of their family unit. The inclusion would, in theory, civilize the slaves with Christian influences because slaves who respected their masters-as children who respect their fathers-would never seek to harm them. Furthermore, the slaves' own family units, like those of their masters, kept a degree of humanity and happiness instilled in the plantation dynamics.","Moreover, slaves were the livelihood of southern plantation owners, and thus owners were necessarily concerned about the health of their slaves. According to William Roger, slavery was an indispensable component of the cotton kingdom, and so, the success of an Alabama plantation and the success of its owner rested upon the slaves.

Billingsley on January 9, 1889. The contract specified that Lang agreed to lease around 48 acres of land previously rented by her husband Ellis Lang and on which she currently lived. The land was to be used for growing cotton. Consequently, the agreed upon rental price was the first three bales of cotton produced from the land each year, each having to weigh in at five hundred pounds. The lease agreement was stated to expire at the end of the year unless otherwise agreed to by Mrs. V.C. Billingsley.","Farm tenancy, the division of land to be rented and farmed by individuals, had been a practice in Texas since the colonial period; however, the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of slaves caused a boom in farm tenancy across the southeastern United States as the demand for both agricultural labor and employment skyrocketed. Initially, sharecropping seemed to be an excellent solution for both those with land and those without; yet eventually, it became evident that sharecropping created a dangerous cycle of debt and, at times, the abuse of power by the traditionally white landowner over the poor black and white sharecroppers. Sharecropping quickly became the most common farm tenant arrangement, one in which the tenant did not receive his or her payment, typically given as a share of the crops, until the crops were harvested and turned into the landowner. Through this system, the landowner still exercised a great degree of power, illustrated by the terms of Lang's contract.","Being a sharecropper was a risky business as many were left with no profit after paying back debts incurred during the growing season. This caused the sharecropper to start off the next growing season already indebted to merchants or the landowner and facing the additional challenge of an uphill battle against the unknowns of Mother Nature. Cotton was particularly popular for the high prices it fetched, yet it seeped all of the nutrients out of the soil starting a succession of diminishing returns. When this happened, sharecroppers frequently had to decrease their crop yield and were unable to seek out more fertile land as state laws mandated they remain on the property until they paid off their debts. Landowners and local merchants often took advantage of sharecroppers, many of whom were still illiterate, and maintained economic control. Indeed, because of the way in which sharecroppers were caught in a cycle of debt and were at the mercy of landowners, Claudine Ferrell refers to sharecropping as a form of economic slavery in her book <em>Reconstruction</em>.","While many poor white men also made a living as sharecroppers, a disproportionately high amount of blacks took part in the practice. Life as a tenant farmer was certainly not as grim as it had been for blacks living in slavery; black men and women technically had the ability to spend their time, money and energy as they so desired. Still, as Reconstruction came to a formal close in 1877, the plantation system remained firmly entrenched and many white landowners saw overseeing sharecroppers as a variation of the duties they had retained during slavery. The landowner maintained control over the individuals on his property and thus a relationship based on domination and vulnerability persisted between many blacks and whites in the South. Regardless of the inequity it perpetuated, sharecropping shaped the economic and social atmosphere of much of the agricultural South long after Reconstruction ended and on through the Depression."],"display_date":"January 9, 1889","search_date":"1889-01-09","locations":[{"id":12743,"lat":31.2532790477,"lng":-96.9358479777,"zoom":9,"place":"FALLS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2352,"title":"Fighting for Equality in the Public Sphere\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-08-25","end_date":"1898-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though Reconstruction ended officially in 1877, the country and its people were far from united as racism and segregation became a growing force. Texas, though on the edge of the South, was certainly no stranger to this battle over inequality. On November 18, 1898, the Galveston News ran an article detailing how Isabelle E. Mabson, a black resident of Galveston, TX, filed suit in the district court against the Missouri, Kansas and Texas railway company of Texas and the Wagner palace car company. The lawsuit was for a total of 1,800 in damages based on the fact that Mabson was denied the ability to ride in the first-class car based on her race. On August 25 of that year, Mabson had purchased first-class tickets to take herself and her children from Kansas City home to Galveston. She was able to ride in the first-class car until the train reached Denison, TX where she was ejected from the car by company officials because Mabson and her children were black. The fact that she was forced from the car in front of her fellow passengers caused her great embarrassment. She and her children were offered to ride in the car for black clients, which was cited as dirty and filled with filth of person and language. Mabson was sick at the time and desired the luxury provided by the first-class car, so she left the train and purchased tickets for the remainder of the journey through the Houston and Texas Central railway.","Isabella Mabson was among the first black women to take a stand for equal treatment in the public sphere by filing suit in federal district court. While the outcome of her case is not known, the article highlights the issues that blacks continued to face in Texas after Reconstruction ended. The Fifteenth Amendment passed in 1870, creating equal rights for all men despite race or color; however, women were not included in this amendment. While the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1875 encouraged many to fight public segregation, efforts were soon curtailed when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the section of that act pertaining to public accommodations unconstitutional. This act enabled states, including Texas, to pass Jim Crow laws at the state and local level which greatly constrained the rights of black men and women. Texas, along with other southern states, put into effect a great deal of laws restricting the day to day behaviors of black residents.","Southern history is full of accounts similar to that of Mabson. Frequently, black passengers would purchase tickets to ride in cars with more pleasant conditions only to be demanded by railroad officials to remove themselves immediately. If the black passenger did not comply, the situation could quickly escalate and at times even resulted in assault. In the 1880s and 90s, railway cars became the first site of state-mandated segregation laws in the South. After the Texas government created legislation for railway-car segregation, the practice of segregation in public settings expanded from there; while the frequency of segregation increased, so did racial tensions. As Edward Ayers emphasizes in his book <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, new generations of whites became squeamish about black people in ways their grandparents could never have imagined-- or afforded. Laws such as this were reaffirmed at the national level in 1896 when the U.S. Supreme Court gave its ruling in the case <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, in which it declared segregation was permitted under the separate but equal clause. In protest of this kind of segregation, blacks practiced civil disobedience and took legal actions such as the above case initiated by Mabson, while many others simply left and went further north in favor of areas such as Kansas which promised more equal treatment.

Finally two candidates had been selected-A.K. Davis was nominated for Lieutenant Governor, while James Hill was chosen to run for Secretary of State-and both men were African American.  This was a crucial decision for the Republican Party because each of these offices was extremely visible in the state of Mississippi.  Senator Alcorn, a prominent Mississippi politician, surprisingly declared that he was against the Republican ticket for reasons he did not immediately disclose.  He said that he would address the people of Mississippi the following evening at Representative Hall.  Upon dismissal of the session, the Republicans still had not decided who they would appoint to run for State Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Education.  ","       James Lusk Alcorn was elected as the first governor of the reconstructed state of Mississippi in 1969, and he later became a United States Senator.  Alcorn was an extremely wealthy white planter who had been against secession in 1861, and was elated when Mississippi rejoined the Union in 1969.  He was a huge proponent of African American involvement in politics; he wanted them to contribute ideas, candidates, and their votes as newly declared United States citizens.  There were many Mississippians, however, who were not complementary of this idea, a large number of them being Democrats.  Voicing the opinions of many Mississippians, one state newspaper claimed, Nigger voting, holding office and sitting in the jury box are all wrong, and against the sentiment of the country.  African Americans were often stereotyped as lazy, ignorant, and illiterate, and therefore totally incompetent as governing officials.  Alcorn became known as an enemy of the white race; his desires for racial legal equality were not only controversial, but the cause of intense hatred towards him.  ","       The resistance to change and the racist lens through which Mississippians tended to view politics made it difficult for a black man to hold office during Reconstruction.  The appointing of two black candidates for office in Mississippi, despite opposition, however, was not entirely uncommon.  When the remaining Radical Reconstruction governments were finally overthrown in 1877, approximately 2,000 African American men had held local, state, and federal public offices in the South, including a wide range of titles and duties.  This proves that the freedmen were able to overcome the obstacles that held them back and not only run for office, but frequently win the election.  Mississippi blacks who ran for office benefited from the fact that their state was over 50 percent African American in 1870; the concentration of African American populations made a major difference in the likelihood of election for black candidates.  A vast majority of the blacks who ran for public office in the lower South were on the Republican ticket, like A.K. Davis and James Hill.  These two pioneers of black political participation in Mississippi were among the many African Americans who fought for a voice in American Politics during the Reconstruction.

Unexpectedly, an African American hiding behind a tree shot Johnson in the head, stunning him and throwing him from his horse. The black man then shot him twice more, first in the wrist and again in the side. Taking him for dead, the assailant dragged Johnson three-hundred yards to a nearby pond, dumping his body in the water. The African American then mounted Johnson's horse and rode off to a party in the neighborhood nearby. Unfortunately for the shooter, the night air somehow revived Joel Johnson and the injured man was able to drag himself back to his home, half a mile away. Johnson related the story to his brother, Abe, who happened to be the Baldwin County Deputy Sheriff. Abe Johnson heard reports that the black man had been seen on his brother's horse, so he set off to arrest the attacker. The sheriff found the man at Jim Malone's home, within the county, and when he tried to arrest the black man, he drew his pistol. Deputy Sheriff Johnson then shot him, whereupon the African American shot right back, the bullet piercing Abe Johnson's chest. The black man then ran, and the sheriff attempted to run after him, shooting once more. The shooter managed to escape, and Abe Johnson perished fifteen minutes later. The black assailant was found dead at four o'clock the following afternoon by onlookers who had developed a search party. He had been shot through the breast and the wrist, and had managed to run half a mile alongside a creek, until he fell into a swamp and died.","After emancipation and during the early years of Reconstruction, there were frequent instances of interracial violence in the South. Episodes like the Johnson men's encounter with a black criminal were especially common in rural areas of the South, where law enforcement in the tumultuous post-war atmosphere was particularly difficult. Some accounts of the Reconstruction years have emphasized the presence of black militiamen and created a false sense among Americans that blacks were out looking to start conflict with whites. There were some blacks who used theft or arson as a means of protest against white oppression, as the black thief in Baldwin County may have intended to, but this was not the norm. Rather, African Americans were usually trying to build new lives as freedmen, not avenge the masters of their pasts. In fact, most of the violence during Reconstruction came from bitter, defeated white Southerners who clung to their support of black enslavement. The concept of white supremacy versus black criminality and inferiority was pervasive in regions like the Gulf Coast. A large Southern crime wave in the late nineteenth century contributed to the tumultuous racial climate, causing an increase in the frequency of lynchings and other forms of interracial violence. Since there were so many African Americans in jails, whites felt there was no doubt that blacks were responsible for the increase in crime rate. This justification further added to the number of violent encounters between the races, such as the shootout between the Johnson brothers and their black assailant.

Next a black witness was asked to take the stand. James Hall, a wealthy African American planter, was summoned to Birmingham to give a testimony concerning the state of blacks in Mobile. James apprehensively approached the podium to make his speech, because what he had to report would please the committee, but it might arouse racist sentiments from his fellow Alabamians. He explained to the committee that he felt that the relations between blacks and whites in Mobile were improving at a steady rate, and he proudly shared that the children were attending school seven months out of the year. James Hall then told the committee that their attendance was at irregular intervals, presumably hoping for improvement in school scheduling for African Americans.","The newly emancipated black population of Southern Alabama created countless new political issues that both parties and government bodies were forced to address.

The school aimed to enhance the labor skills of newly freed blacks. The state chartered 15,000 towards the school, but still needed more funds. The board of trustees purchased three hundred acres of land with an estimated worth of 2800 in yielded crops. Yet it did not yet have the bare essentials needed to function. Over 100 pupils attended the school, the rooms were not big enough to accommodate the students, and there were not enough farming instruments for the use of the school's manufacturing and mechanical branches. The board acknowledged Watkins's appeals and sent agents north to seek assistance and support. "," Seeking assistance in the North was necessary because support within their own state was not likely. After congress passed the fourteenth amendment granting citizenship to African Americans July of 1868, many Tennesseans became furious. Riots broke out. Radical conservatives established group aimed to terrorize African Americans called the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Robert Corlew reported that Troops were necessary to stop atrocious murders and numerous outrages which had been committed by violent and disloyal men. "," In response to such violent outcries, Congress worked fast to design the Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans survive among the chaos. They distributed food, supervised contracts, and established schools. This bureau offered government and abandoned land as a refuge and by December of 1968, already established the Manual Labor School in Rutherford, Tennessee. They created the school to help African Americans develop labor skills in order to function in society and intended to have enough classrooms as well as tools they could use for practice. Education was so popular among African Americans because they had never before had the opportunity to receive it. With such a large turnout of students, the original allotted funds for the school were not sufficient. "," Schools for African Americans in the South had trouble receiving sufficient funds because they were surrounded by so much opposition to their cause, yet the eagerness of African Americans to learn was the key to starting educational institutions. According to Stephen Hahn, the burdens of establishing and running schools fell chiefly to the freed people themselves. They had to pool their meager resources, rent or purchase a tract of land, build a schoolhouse, and hire a teacher. By 1867 African Americans composed about one-third of the teachers in freedman's schools, and was growing. Those dedicated to receiving more funds had to lobby to northerners for support. Republican leaders of the Freedman's bureau made great attempts to respond to the requests of the newly freed blacks, hoping to receive their votes once they learned about the voting process, but it was difficult because there just was not a lot of money to give.

Here he saw a settler arriving in Texas with a group of slaves. The large band of black enslaved men and women moved about without cares; they laughed and joke as they ate their biscuits. A man only identified as the entertainer of the group created comic relief when he whipped a donkey who in turn kicked the hind quarters of a very fat man. The slaves laughed uncontrollably, spewing out pieces of biscuit and some nearly choking because they were laughing so hard. ","As the train left the wharf, Sheridan could not help but pity the jovial slaves who were ignorant of what lay ahead of them. Go your ways, he wrote, go your ways my happy thoughtless party - happy because thoughtless, the time may not be far distant... when your quips & cranks will be turned into tears, wails & groans. Sheridan predicted the break up of the happy group as members would be sold as property to repay debts and satisfy the needs of their master.","Texas's close proximity to Louisiana and the New Orleans slave market, the largest in the country, made Sheridan's predictions viable. Walter Johnson poignantly describes the slave trade as, the story of separated lovers and broken families, of widows, widowers, and orphans left in the wake of the trade, only, perhaps, to be sold themselves at a later date. The interstate slave trade separated families and friends all the time; there was no reason to think it would be different for this group of slaves. Being sold to other slave owners was a fact of life for slaves, and Sheridan believed the thought of this should have sobered up the band of slaves and made them more serious and reserved. ","Like many other white people of this time, Sheridan depicted the band of slaves with condescension. There were conventional topics that white writers focused on when describing slaves: 'the skin, the odor, the dialect, the shuffle,' and even the endearing 'imbecile good nature.' Sheridan primarily focused on the nature of the black slaves; they were funny, loud, and grotesque. Sheridan could not look past these things and see the vibrant African American culture as a way for slaves to deal with their enslavement. Sheridan's entry shows that he had a good knowledge of the slave trade an the hardships slaves face, but that he was ignorant of black culture and how it related to their condition as slaves.

Mrs. McC. left her with her family in Baltimore expecting her to return to Chicago when she was well; however, the sickness grew worse and they sent her to the Baltimore Infirmary.

As Edward Ayers describes, segregation existed but was not completely nor universally defined. There was heavy racism and separatism, but also advancements in the black community. Race relations were complex and varied; friendships and positive relations could exist while being entwined in race traditions.

The townsmen that entered requested that Sterne issue a warrant for the arrest of William Simons. They informed Sterne that Simons had tried to kill a free African American blacksmith named William Goyens. Sterne did as the men asked and then did not hear about Goyens or Simons for the rest of the evening. The next day Sterne learned that the gunshot wound Goyens received had not been fatal and that he was expected to recover. This episode related in Sterne's diary over a two day period is interesting because of the editorial inserts Sterne made. On August 27, 1842, when he first heard about the attempted murder, he interjected, Several People in Town all very merry. Then on August 28, he said that the wound Goyens received was not enough to do any good. These comments Sterne made are telling of the mindset toward Goyens. Sterne made no record of any personal grievances with Goyens, but it is clear that he was not on good terms with him, nor was he popular in town. This attitude may have stemmed from Goyens's position as a free black man and slave owner.","The feeling of Texans toward free blacks during the Texas Republic was one of fear and distrust. According to Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen, Many Texans feared that the existence of a free black population would undermine the institution of slavery. To guard against free blacks living in Texas and being a bad influence on slaves, Texas required free blacks to obtain permission from Congress to live in Texas. During the early 1840s measures to prevent free black occupation of Texas increased. President Mirabeau B. Lamar gave the order that all free blacks had to leave Texas by January 1, 1842. Luckily for the free black population, Sam Houston repealed this law upon his reelection in 1842 and allowed free blacks to remain in Texas. ","The shooting of Goyens occurred right in the time period of the early 1840s when Lamar had decided to crack down on the free blacks in Texas. The bad feelings of white Texans toward the repeal of Lamar's law could be the reason for the joy of the townspeople at the shooting and Sterne's disappointment at the murder being unsuccessful. To add to their dislike was that Goyens owned some slaves himself. The presence of a free black man was bad enough, but the presence of a free black slave owner would have been too much for some. Goyens showed that there were opportunities for blacks outside of slavery, a notion dangerous to a society built on the enslaving of black men and women.

The diary of Dr. Walter Wade proved that even in the mid-nineteenth century that this concept was not a foreign one. A large percentage of his journal was dedicated to a documentation of his private medical records. In a February 21, 1848 entry, Wade described his Monday night visit to a woman named Sarah. Wade devoted few words to the entry, but his impact was nonetheless powerful. He succinctly stated that, Sarah had an abortion at 3 mos. Wade provided the reader with sparse details about Sarah, but he did mention that the terminated pregnancy had consisted of twins. However, he was unable to learn the gender of the pair, presumably because the pregnancy was not far enough advanced. Wade maintained a business-like and professional tone throughout the passage; one can only assume that this detached air his writing emanated was reflected in his actions as a physician."," An individual's livelihood was undoubtedly unstable in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of, High infant mortality rate and tragic loss of loved ones to disease or accident in the prime of life, according to historians James and Dorothy Volo death became an accepted and inexorable fact of existence. As a whole, individuals found it easier to resign themselves to the reality of mortality, and doctors, who were already required to uphold an air of formality concerning their patients, were no different. Doctors undoubtedly practiced abortion in the antebellum South, but because it was a sensitive and often taboo subject, it is difficult to find example of it recorded. Some instances of abortion have been discovered among the records of slave women who were either unable to care for their children due to the harsh demands of their required work or whose children were often sold by avaricious masters. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, one woman was forced to watch as her master put all of her infant children up for sale, until, taking matters until her own hands, she decided that she was not going to let her master sell that baby. 'She got up and give it something out of a bottle and purty soon it was dead'. Says Fox-Genovese, these desperate women saw either terminating their pregnancies or killing their own children as a, ... way [to reclaim] it as their own. In a perverse way, infanticide could be seen as a means to give children life. "," There is no way to tell from Wade's brief diary entry what the primary motivation was behind Sarah's decision to abort her babies.

Wesleyan Methodist preacher Jesse McBride had stirred too much controversy among whites and slaves in Guilford County.  Intending to run McBride out of the county, about two-hundred men gathered on May 23, 1851 outside of the church where he would preach that morning.  For six hours McBride had been on the road, not finishing the 18 mile journey to his Liberty Hill congregation outside of Greensboro until a few minutes before noon.  Accounts of the exchange between McBride and the disgruntled locals vary according to source.  The mob leader and slave-owner Hoover blocked McBride from entering the church.  McBride appears to have kept a cool head in the confrontation: he drew upon scriptural resources, he induced his congregation to sing hymns in front of the increasingly frustrated mob, and he conducted his congregation in prayers. Without personal violence or abuse according to the local <em>Greensboro Patriot</em>, but with considerable, drunken man-handling according to McBride's personal account in the abolitionist <em>Liberator</em>, the mob shoved McBride into his carriage.  He rode away.  Sometime immediately thereafter, local powers obtained his pledge in writing to depart Guilford County within a week.  McBride returned to Ohio.  The <em>Liberator</em> published his first account on June 20 and then a more elaborate version on August 15.  The <em>Greensboro Patriot </em>expressed relief and anticipated a return to tranquility in its brief account of the incident.  ","The creed of Wesleyan Methodists involved an antislavery stance, and for this reason many whites no longer tolerated McBride's growing influence among the Christian circles of Guilford and Stokes Counties.  On May 18, Reverend Hines of the Methodist Episcopal Church had stated the deleterious effects of McBride's sermons in a meeting.  Local officials held another meeting in Greensboro on May 20 for the purpose of suppressing abolition agitation.  During the meeting, McBride was implicated directly for interfering with the property rights of local slave-owners.  He had created enemies among nervous slave-holders and among vexed preachers whose congregations were splintering over slavery.","Beginning with zeal in 1831, when William Lloyd Garrison began publishing the <em>Liberator</em>, and gaining controversial attention in the wake of Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion, the Abolition crusade began making its presence felt among slave-holders.  Because Southern churches' policies accommodated slavery, the Methodist Church split in 1844, and supporters of slavery established the Methodist Episcopal Church.  This episode in McBride's career strengthens Donald Matthews' description of the brave extension of the Evangelical ethos beyond the internal life of the believer and into social relationships. McBride's<em> Wesleyan</em> sect of Methodism, which threatened excommunication to those who would not emancipate their slaves within two years, scared slaveholders with its judgmental views.  McBride's brave efforts to nurture an anti-slavery parish illustrate both the active efforts of anti-slavery ideology and the physical resistance these efforts met from pro-slavery interests."],"display_date":"May 18, 1851 - August 15, 1851","search_date":"1851-07-01","locations":[{"id":9489,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2420,"title":"Paternalism, Slaveholders, and the Guilty Conscience","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-02-27","end_date":"1851-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 27, 1851, John M.

However, Folkes was not quick to comply wholly with Drake's wishes. He replied that both the slaves and Drake himself, chose me for their master.

He goes so far as to name two slaves that he would particularly like to keep, a man named Abram and another individual whose name is illegible. Folkes' letter did not solve what was clearly a complex and hotly contested issue between the two men. But Folkes did show a judicious side and agreed to discuss the matter in person before any further action was taken."," John Folkes was one example of a larger group of slaveholders that emerged in the midst of the slave South. Folkes fought Benjamin Drake's desire to sell his slaves because, he argued, they were not only members of his household, but of his family as well. Folkes' words reflect a growing sentiment among slaveholders in which buyers believed that their participation in the slave market was actually beneficial to the slaves. Slave-buyers had the power to keep family units in tact by purchasing all the members of a slave's family. This paternalism, historian Walter Johnson states, caused slaveholders, to say that they were acting on behalf of the people whom they had bought to act for them. Therefore, in retaining certain family units, buyers believed they were actually doing their slaves a favor. "," From his firm reply to Drake, Folkes clearly ascribed to this sentiment of paternalism, and vehemently wished to retain both his household and the members of his slave family. But in doing so, he also yielded to a certain delusion in thinking that he helped his slaves by any means.

He began the 26 mile journey from Gaston to Fayetteville on foot and let the coach catch up with him along the way.  By one o'clock, though he had covered almost ten miles, he doubted he had passed even half a dozen farms.  Olmsted took lunch at the Banks' plantation where fresh horses for the stagecoach grazed in the field.  To Olmsted's dismay, the fresh horses could do but little more than stand up.  At last the stagecoach arrived but its ineloquent driver could only mutter distressed comments about the horses: There ain't a man in North Car'lina could drive them horses up the hills without a whip. With the help of several black men, the driver at last thrashed and verbally harassed the ostensibly-fresh horses into action.  Three miles later, using real, outright, old-fashioned, uncompromising English oaths, as loud as he could yell, the driver again resorted to violence as onlooking passengers idled.  This time he used a rail.  Exasperated by the wait, some of the weary passengers offered assistance. Olmsted resorted again to his own legs and by eight p.m. arrived at Mrs. Barclay's inn where his fellow passengers did not arrive until three a.m.","In this vignette from North Carolina and in many other instances throughout the South, Olmsted journeyed down isolated, poorly-maintained roads, detailing the poor condition of transportation.  The roads he traveled often comprised little more than deforested trails.  At points, he traveled for several days and never saw two dwellings of mankind within sight of each other. Several plantation patriarchates were miles apart. He recorded his many experiences and minute-by-minute conversations in over seven-hundred pages, which he gave to the New York Daily Times.  That Northern editors considered Olmsted's observations exotic enough to be published attests to a communication gap between the North and South.","Olmsted's accounts of Southern transportation deficiencies support Stephen Goldfarb's analysis of geographical isolation as a limiting factor to Southern industrialization.  He endured the same arduous traveling conditions as Piedmont farmers who sought distant markets for their produce.  Writing for a Northern audience, at points Olmsted takes pleasure in contrasting the efficient transportation networks of the North with the ridiculous networks he encounters in the South.  He was also struck by the low density of homesteads; Edward Ayers explores a similar phenomenon of slave-holding counties in comparisons between Virginia and Pennsylvania during the Civil War.  The immense challenges to transportation in North Carolina's Piedmont, exacerbated by a sparsely-populated landscape, represent an insularity from national trends of industrialization."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":9380,"lat":35.1897473693,"lng":-78.9269058663,"zoom":8,"place":"CUMBERLAND, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2424,"title":"The Hypocritical Admirers of Harriet Beecher Stowe\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-06-18","end_date":"1853-06-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Editors of the <em>Raleigh Register</em> reprinted stanzas of a poem published in New York that criticized what Raleigh's editors considered the hypocritical nature of aristocratic British support for <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> in 1853.  They applauded the satiric criticism as the severest and most truthful against Stowe and her British supporters. The poem was written as if by a British aristocrat who both commends Britain for banishing slavery and yet also foppishly implicated British class differences as equally, if not more, merciless than American slavery.  <em>British</em> peasants, it reads, are not our slaves, and 'tis tickingly pleasant, / To think they have <em>free</em>dom - to die in a ditch The eight stanzas levelled many shocking attacks against British institutions.  For example, the article implied that Britons permitted their women to work in coal shafts on hands and knees without clothes.  One line, which would have particularly resonated in 1853 read, Though Irishmen rot in the fever and famine, / Which we have created- we speak it with pride- / <em>That, if you will calmly and fairly examine</em>, / You'll find they were perfectly free- when they died","    Stowe's novel introduced further turmoil to a tumultuous era of United States History, during which embittered pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions bemoaned the Compromise of 1850.  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants, fleeing the distresses of famine and poverty in Ireland inflated America with visible proof of English oppression.  The North Carolinian editors' concise but harsh attack against Stowe, similar in logic to James Henry Hammond's 1858 Mudsill Theory speech, argues that slavery eliminates the need for downtrodden white peasants in societies.  ","In the larger context of understanding how white Southerners justified slavery, this article exemplifies one method of neutralizing Stowe's potent attacks against slavery.  The <em>Register</em>'s editors attempted to devalue <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> by showing that other civilized nations were themselves reliant upon impoverished labor.  By this logic, Stowe's supporters abroad had no right to comment upon American institutions.  Wendy Hamand writes of a similarly anti-British response to incidents such as the Stafford House Address, a document from British ladies requesting an end to slavery.  Mrs. John Tyler from Virginia responded that the Duchess of Sutherland should tend to her own dependents and leave American ladies to attend to theirs.  Clearly, the tendency to reject Stowe rather than re-evaluate slavery prevailed among pro-slavery factions."],"display_date":"June 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-06-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2431,"title":"African-American Traveler Jailed Despite Documents\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-05","end_date":"1848-01-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sherriff Willie Pope incarcerated the black man calling himself Sam Fary just three days after Christmas.  Though Sam claimed himself a free man, Pope placed a front page advertisement in the local paper requesting Fary's owner to come forward, prove property, pay charges and take him away, or he will be dealt with as the law directs. The newspaper notice included a small cartoon of a running black man.  Pope's ad acknowledges Fary's claim to being a free man, and described no fewer than seven documents in Fary's possession.  One document purports that Fary bought his own freedom from James Kagler in 1840.  His other documents included passes, four of which call him Isaac. One document, signed by Kagler and dated five days before the arrest, gave Fary permission to pass within the State, or to visit his connexions in North Carolina. Fary also carried a Dream Book bearing a woman's name. ","Many details of this incident remain unknown, contributing to the mysterious nature of what seems a wholly unjust incarceration.  Sheriff Pope gives all appearances of blatantly holding a free black man in jail and attempting to pass him off as a fugitive slave.  This incident, played out even under the rules of a slaveholding society, offers little rationality for advertising a black man, with documentation of his freedom, as a slave.  Pope excludes any possibility in his notice that Fary may have spoken truthfully and that his paperwork may have been perfectly valid.  Perhaps Fary was utilizing the traditional week of Christmas vacation as an opportunity to visit relatives.  If Fary was in fact telling the truth, Pope stood to gain from re-enslaving him to a local buyer, receiving at the very least the jailing charges. Even if Pope had specific evidence that Fary was indeed a fugitive slave who had obtained false papers, the fact that he omitted such evidence in the advertisement suggests that readers would have automatically believed a white man over a freed black.","The rights of free blacks in Prince Edward County, Virginia, as argued by Mel Ely, blend incongruously with what appears the total lack of rights afforded to Fary in the North Carolina Piedmont.  Ely's description of the possibilities afforded to free blacks in the rural Old South spars with the efforts of those like Willie Pope to contain African-Americans within, or return them to, the system of slavery.  And still, there is probably much relevant information to the case missing from Pope's short ad.  But what remains is nevertheless an embarrassing record of white supremacy."],"display_date":"January 5, 1848","search_date":"1848-01-05","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2439,"title":"Kidnapped African American Girl Returned to Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-01-01","end_date":"1871-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" In 1868, a young African American girl was kidnapped from her home in St. Louis, ","Missouri and sold into slavery in Cuba.

After three years of recommendations, petitions, and court proceedings, the Senate of the state of North Carolina denied Lunsford Lane extension on his residency in the state to allow more time to purchase his wife and seven children.  Lunsford had been commended and allowed by his employer, the Governor of the State, to remain employed in the Governor's office keeping order, running errands, and making deliveries, according to a letter sent to the Legislature.  The letter acknowledged that this would be against the North Carolina law that required free slaves to leave within twenty days of being warned out. In 1840, the Secretary to Governor Dudley wrote the first request for Lane's extenuating circumstances.  The letter was answered with no objection, but the situation was considered a legal matter, which resulted in Lane being summoned to court. Due to an unprepared prosecution team, the case was postponed for three months, which allowed Lane to negotiate a petition of relief to be signed by over twenty men and sent to the Legislature for evidence of his strength as a respectable, hard-working man.  When the Court finally met and his case was argued, Lane was not allowed in the Senate chamber because he was a colored man and waited in great fear and anticipation.  The members adjourned and harshly reported Well Lunsford, they have laid you out; the nigger bill is killed.  This was a cruel reality, laced with mockery from the white members of the Senate, and Lane claimed to have felt defeat at its worst and utter hopelessness in the face of humanity.  He was not only denied, but also banished from North Carolina, departing three days later on May 18, 1841, for New York City.What is significant about this narrative is the blurred definition of freedom in all-white institutions in the South.  The freedom granted to Lunsford Lane is an example of the restrictions placed on blacks even after they reached their ultimate goal of liberty.  Freedom was never really free, as historian Robert Fogel found in research of slaves and their owners.  The act of denying citizenship and any extended privileges were both absent from the lives of freed blacks in almost every state, which often left them still suffering from oppression in a white supremacist society, no matter what physical or mental state they were in.  In Lane's case, even though he was awarded freedom, his material conditions and life working for the Governor at least allowed him to be close to his family and earn a substantial living, which were not guaranteed with his freedom."],"display_date":"November 3, 1840 - May 18, 1841","search_date":"1841-02-08","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2450,"title":"INDEPENDENCE DAY, 1881:The Founding of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-04","end_date":"1881-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 4, 1881, Booker T. Washington helped Lewis Adams, a former slave, make his dream a reality. The founding of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute ushered in a new era for African American education in Alabama and the nation. Booker T. Washington began his career the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, under General Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Washington's keen mind and brilliant thoughts got the attention of General Armstrong who begrudgingly mentioned Washington's abilities to George Campbell, a citizen of Tuskegee and president of the Board of Trustees at the Tuskegee Institute. Campbell, a former slave owner, was working through specifics with both Lewis Adams and State officials in Alabama to create an institute of higher learning and trade, primarily for African American pupils. Campbell sought the leadership of a strong black figure and found it in Washington.","The Institute was lucky to have many legislative allies. Two white senators, W.F. Foster and A.L. Brooks, were so enamored with the idea of the Tuskegee Institute that they sought to secure its future by acquiring state funding for the project. Foster and Brooks were able to urge the appropriation of two-thousand dollars worth of state funds for teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries were just the tip of the iceberg. The school lacked land, buildings and faculty members. When Washington arrived in Tuskegee in June of 1881, the Institute was extremely disorganized. In a mere month, in preparation for the grand opening, Washington managed to secure a single school building and several other necessities. Later Washington wrote in his journal, I opened the school...in an old church and a little shanty that was almost ready to fall down from decay.","It was evident that the only way to sustain the Tuskegee Institute was with more funding. Washington was forced to ask for every resource. He petitioned his friend Mr. Francis Chickering Briggs asking, My first great need is apparatus, such as maps writing-charts, globes. I thought by writing to you I might get a great many of these kid of thing which you would not miss there. He continued his quest, writing James Fowle Baldwin Marshall; Dear Friend: Please send me the addresses of some publishing houses where I can get my books at reduced rates. Over the years, Washington's fund-raising efforts paid off and the Tuskegee Institute, which opened its dilapidated doors to 37 students in July of 1881, grew significantly. At Washington's death in 1915, the Institute had 1,500 students, a two million dollar endowment, and instruction in forty trades, one-hundred fully-equipped buildings, and about 200 faculty members.","The founding of the Tuskegee Institute was important to blacks, not only in Alabama but also the South. The Institute provided an education in particular trades and this specialized education enabled blacks to better themselves and their socioeconomic status by providing employment opportunities in the wake of slavery and servitude. Blacks from all reaches of the South and even into the North traveled to Tuskegee to enroll and learn in an environment conducive to progressive race relations. Tolerance of education for blacks started to increase on July 4, 1881 and would continue to climb due to the addition of the Tuskegee Institute to the antebellum landscape of Alabama.

November 5, was a chance to right the wrongs of the election of 1870, only two years prior. The 1870 election included the race for secretary of state and James T. Rapier, born a free black in Florence, Alabama just thirty-three years prior, was on the ballot. Rapier became a prominent figure early in his life, participating in the National Negro Labor Convention (NNLC) and working as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessor among other involvements. It was not until Rapier became the first African American in Alabama history to run for a state office that his popularity nearly doubled. ","Despite his historic run, Rapier did not win the election of 1870. Klu Klux Klansmen, who, based on their beliefs, had obvious qualms with Rapier's attempt, intimidated voters with threats and violence. The Klan's interference made it nearly impossible for Rapier to garner support. Thankfully Rapier was neither discouraged nor fearful of the Klan. He courageously continued about his efforts in order to better situate himself for the 1872 midterm elections to follow. Rapier sought out allies in the black community in order to gain endorsements from any recognizable resource. He established himself as a republican and mounted an impressive campaign for Congress. His travels took him to nearly every area of Alabama. But, it was not until Election Day in 1872 that the fruits of his labor were realized.","Election Day was calm and peaceful. As hoped, blacks crowded the polls early in the day, showing their support for their fellow black citizen, James T. Rapier. Previous elections in Alabama had become violently protested, but the elections of November 5, 1872, proved to be perhaps the most tranquil in Alabama election history. Unhindered by interference and intimidation, nearly 70 seventy percent of the voter's turned out at the polls. As the totals were tallied, it was evident that Rapier would win, sweeping the Black Belt and carrying over one thousand white votes. Crucial to his victory was the fact that throughout his campaign James T. Rapier focused solely on planks in his party's platform. Rapier refused to discuss his race, citing it as a feature unique to him that would not negatively affect his leadership in Congress.","The election of 1872 proved to have a positive influence on racial opinions in the state of Alabama. Electing James T. Rapier to Congress sent a message to others in the South that repressing race was not the answer and no longer the norm. There were those in the South who still vehemently opposed the election of a black man to Congress. Despite opposition, it is important to realize the intense progress of the black race. Less than ten years prior to the election of James T. Rapier, blacks were enslaved pieces of disenfranchised property that counted as 3/5 of a citizen.

The city's two main roads were still, the farms and fields hot with the summer sun; the rural environment uninterrupted. The only sound for miles was that of a train barreling down the Rome and Dalton railroad.","The events both inside and outside of the train did not reflect the peace and quiet that lent itself to Patona. Earlier that morning, a fight had erupted inside the train between a white boy and a black man. The assault escalated when the train came to a stop at Patona/Cross Plains and others joined in on the fray. It was not until later in the evening that Green Little, a former slave mustered up a small army of men to continue the day's events at Cross Plains. William Luke, an Irishman, an immigrant and a Methodist minister did his best to persuade Little not to settle the score. The pistol-touting Little refused to listen and continued on as the night grew dark and sticky with the evening heat. ","Hearing the news of an imminent attack, members of the local Methodist Church began to flee. Commotion ensued, bullets whipped the wind and gunfire could be heard for miles. For 48-hours Cross Plains was in distress. Women and children sought safety while their men combated neighbors in the streets. The chaos was quieted by Major Bailey, a confederate veteran and a current administrator at the local school house. Bailey took measures to turn the prisoners over to the sheriff and the men involved in the conflict were then escorted down the tree-lined streets of Cross Plains. They were quarantined and questioned in the schoolhouse. The instigator, Green Little was no where to be found. ","The local sheriff started his questioning about the incident with William Luke who immediately admitted his role. Luke had sold the pistols to the black men of Patona, making him liable for the incident. Witnesses gathered and a disorganized trial commenced. The evening grew dark and the hour late, accordingly the trial ceased and was scheduled to resume the next day. It was at this late hour, when bystanders had returned to their homes, that local members of the Klu Klux Klan executed a vicious plan. The Klan, known for their racial hatred and violence, hid armed in the shadows as the prisoners settled in for what would be, unbeknownst to them, the last night of their lives. ","The Klansmen attacked the prisoners, hitting and dragging them down the street and well across the railroad tracks. The mob stopped upon reaching the edge of town at Prior's Station. Torches lit, ropes in hand, the Klansmen prepared to exterminate Luke and his black counterparts. Three blacks hanged first, followed by two more. Luke was allowed enough time to write his wife. In his letter, he claimed he his death was deserved and God would certainly forgive him. The executioners had been quick to kill the black men, but one of their own, Luke, white male, took consideration. Luke was hanged in a different fashion and even in death received better treatment than the black men around him. On the morning of July 12, 1870, the day following the attacks, all was reported as quiet at the Plains. ","The incident at Cross Plains exemplified the deep-seeded hatred that continued to plague certain sections of southern states. Calhoun County, Alabama was no exception. Factions of the Klu Klux Klan could be found in every former confederate state. Similar incidents, like that of Cross Plains, occurred with regularity in other areas. The Civil War may have ended in 1865, but battles continued to rage in tension filled regions of former confederate strong holds.

The second called Roosevelt a demagogue and hypocrite, and attacked his play to the negro and apparent boast of his son sitting next to a black student.

As Edward Ayers explains, the newspapers played a vital role of spreading ideas and opinions in the county. Alfred Stone believes that Roosevelt's actions during the campaign and then during his first few months in the White House insulted the South in a way that no one had done for many years. He also believes that the attitude most held was that Roosevelt had damaged the relations between the races, not that he improved them by trying to make their lives better. The Democrats campaigned against Roosevelt by attacking his warm relations toward blacks and encouraged the growth of the fear that the South had toward Roosevelt.

Though he was taking a risk as a reader he also writes to inform the editors that the anti-slavery cause is rapidly gaining ground in this section of the country.  The African American papers acted as a source to unite free blacks across the country and make their motives known to the rest of the country.  The papers offered a means for the abolitionist groups and movement to spread throughout the country.  Not only did the freemen in Maryland believe that the abolitionist movement was strong, but Thomas Hamilton, a European traveler through America, believed that it was highly probable that Maryland will not long continue to be disgraced by the existence of slavery within its boundariesnor is there any possible reason why the system of slave labour might not be instantly abolished.  In the 1830s, the abolitionists cause was growing through the establishment of African American newspapers.  These were published in the North but traveled south to enslaved people, or free blacks living in the South.  One such paper was The Colored American, established in 1839 in New York by three men; Samuel Cornish, Philip Bell, and Charles Bennett Ray.

This was the assumption made by one advertisement of the Red Flag Store, whose proprietor had recently purchased quality Ready-Made Clothing from Pumperle, Geven & Co. following their bankruptcy. The store, like many others, had been shut down and its workers made unemployed. These stores had attracted business mainly from Southern customers, and prior to secession and growing divisions between North and South, this market was dramatically reduced. Bankruptcy of Northern stores provided wealthy Southerners with a sound investment. Not once did the advertisement mention the Abolitionist contribution to the failure of these stores, other than Abolitionism existed where these stores collapsed. Apart from providing a cheap bargain for patrons of the Red Flag Store, the advertisement dissuaded potential ideological views by connecting inferred Northern thinking with failed economic endeavors. Those who discarded these ideological views were assure not to witness the effect of abolitionism in New York.","While certain aspects of the advertisement are propaganda, Southern economic expansion was a reality. James McPherson establishes the precedent for economic growth in the North and the South. In an effort to create Southern economic independence, Southerners revived the Southern Commercial Convention, which met through the 1850s. This organization ensure that Southerners would only buy Southern goods, and it promoted the construction of railroads, steamship lines, port facilities, banks, factories, and any other institutions that would create a more independent South. When secession was immanent, trade relations soured even more between the North and the South. The economic independence that the South strove for a decade earlier, would help that region create some of its own manufactories and allow for essential products to be made within the region.

Directly under and advertisement of ten pigs for sale, there is the section of lost property, for which rewards are offered. There are six articles that report lost animals or slaves. 50 is offered for a stolen black horse, as well as 50 for a dark bay mare. Intermixed with these ads for horses, are rewards for runaway slaves, ranging from 50 to 300 per slave. Descriptions of color, markings, age, and last known location are given for slave and animal alike. The only difference in description between the two categories of lost property is that the horses are reported stolen, while the slaves are reported as runaway; logically showing that the horses could not have let themselves out of their gates. ","This underscores the status of people, slaves at the time, were property. The moral ambiguity and hypocritical self-justification did not matter as much as the value that slaveowners attributed to this human commodity. Slave traders would have associates search the country for good bargains on slaves. They would attempt to buy low and sell high and would willingly risk loss if a slave sold for less than purchases or even died. The slave demand had a clear connection to the cycles of the agricultural economy, the harvesting of various crops in different regions.","Walter Johnson outlines the methodical process in which slaves were separated from every part of their person identity, except their unbreakable souls. Slaves were stripped down of their personal character and taught new skills in order to provide a commodity to the customer; whatever type of slave was needed was offered, whether a field hand, a butler or a mistress. Out of this systematic trade of humans, the beginning of self-emancipation was born, Slaves sometimes stood up in defiance of being sold, even if it meant suicide, and all slaves became unified in slave communities, while they waited in pens to be sold."],"display_date":"May 12, 1863 - May 13, 1863","search_date":"1863-05-12","locations":[{"id":13639,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2535,"title":"Industrial Education for Boys in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"5/10/00","end_date":"5/10/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The stage was set; the town was ready. The conference on race relations to be held in Montgomery, Alabama was a highly anticipated event. The political affair would bring to town many of the nation's finest orators and most distinguished authorities on the subject of race. On May 8, 1900, the Montgomery Auditorium hosted the conference, which included various speeches on racial issues from greater educational opportunities for blacks in the country to a repeal of the fifteenth amendment. The front page of the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> celebrated the conference's turnout: LARGE AUDIENCES ASSEMBLE TO HEAR THE DISTINGUISED ORATORS PRESENT THEIR VIEWS. "," In the midst of the conference on race relations in Montgomery, one article in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> pleaded with the state to recognize the needs of poor whites in Alabama before attempting to better the position of blacks. This editorial, Industrial Education for White Boys in Alabama, specifically addressed the educational crisis in Alabama. The editorial cited the 1890 formation of an industrial institution in Tennessee as an example of a thousand fold return to the state in terms of citizenship. The article rallied, People of Alabama, where are your thousand boys? On the waste heap it is feared. The <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> editorial emphasized Alabama's educational emergency and called for a statewide reform, thus challenging the existing model of education in the state. "," The educational deficiencies in Alabama at the beginning of the twentieth century took root in statewide politics. White Democrats regained political power throughout Alabama during what was known as the Bourbon years (1874-1890). The moniker recalled the House of Bourbon's restoration after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The Democratic Bourbons immediately enacted measures to reduce the state debt and as a result funding for education decreased. In one swift political decision the Democrats eliminated the State Board of Education and significantly reduced both educational appropriations and constitutional guarantees of financial support. According to historian William Rogers, The Democrats opted for decentralization in control of educational affairs. "," These sixteen years of Bourbon rule would impact the statewide educational system into the twentieth century. Until 1891 Alabama schools were awarded funding based on the number of students by race. According to Rogers, townships could appropriate funds based on an amount they might deem just and equitable. This subjective appropriation of funding led to inadequate funding for black schools. However, blacks were not the only students suffering in Alabama. In 1900, there were 104,883 illiterate whites aged ten years or older living across Alabama. At 338,605, the illiteracy was significantly higher for blacks in the state, but these alarming numbers in both categories demonstrated a failed system. In his Bourbon Democracy in Alabama, Allen Going evaluates Alabama's educational system in light of Bourbon politics. He writes, The condition of Alabama schools, however, in comparison with those in other parts of the country was poor indeed. In 1890, the state ranked fourth from the bottom in a listing of various school statistics for all states by the Federal commissioner of education. When the editorial in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> ran ten years later in 1900, the effects of the Bourbon Democrats lingered throughout Alabama. The educational deficiencies and resultant illiteracy rates at the beginning of the twentieth century resulted from a laissez-faire state government.

On the evening of August 27, 1889, the trainmen pulled into the Birmingham station and prepared to disembark.  Upon exiting the train, the workers spotted two black men swinging from trees in the near distance.  According to sources at <em>The Washington Post,</em> the lynched men were the incendiary editors of the black newspaper, the Independent.  The editors were allegedly run out of Selma, Alabama the preceding week and supposed to have been lynched in Birmingham.  <em>The Post </em>noted, It is impossible to get particulars.  ","<em>The Post's</em> report incidentally concluded the dramatic Selma controversy first exposed in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> on August 20, 1889.  The article, Alabama's War of Races, shed light on the racial tensions that plagued Selma.  On August 19, Reverend Edward Bryant, associate editor to the Independent wrote a highly controversial editorial attacking the whites of Selma and the larger southern community.   In his charged conclusion Bryant projected, You have had your revolutionary and civil wars and we here predict that at no distant day we will have our race war, and we hope, as God intends, that we will be strong enough to wipe you out of existence and hardly leave enough of you to tell the story.  According to the Tribune, Selma mayor, E. Starr publicly condemned the revolutionary nature of Byrant's editorial.  Both sides built up arms in the likely event of a violent outbreak.  Mayor Starr held the pledge of Confederate veterans to fight on behalf of the uniformly armed white population of Selma.  Bloodshed and conflict appeared almost unavoidable.   ","Racial tensions and violence plague the history of Alabama.  According to historian Virginia Hamilton, the use of violence was originally disconnected from racial issues, oftentimes settling disputes between whites settlers.  However, the tradition of violence in Alabama eventually shifted towards African Americans in the years following the Civil War.  Hamilton writes, Violence, the hasty recourse for settling scores between white men in frontier Alabama, was focused upon blacks after emancipation and war had proclaimed them to be people instead of property.  Initially the fear of a black uprising involving armed and newly freed slaves drove groups such as the Ku Klux Klan to persecute and execute countless African Americans in Alabama.  Towards the end of the century, however, statewide politics influenced many lynchings across the state.  One such example was the infamous 1882 lynching of black Republican leader, Jack Turner.  When Turner's Choctow County voted Republican in the 1882 gubernatorial election, the Democrats panicked.  With an upcoming congressional election the Democrats could not risk losing political power to the Republicans; Turner was shortly after found hanging from an oak tree.  ","    <em>The Post's</em> report of the lynching fits into the larger story of southern lynching in the post-slavery era.  A vague allegation of criminality motivated lynchings throughout the South.  There was an average of 150.4 lynchings per year during the last 19 years of the nineteenth century (1882-1900).  These lynched victims were usually accused of raping white women or other trivial crimes.  The murder of the two Independent editors does not fit into the general theme of crime retaliation seeing as the only crime committed was in their exercise of freedom of speech.  However, the story of Rev. Bryant and his associate editor at the Independent portrays the lingering fear of a black revolution.  The perpetual threat of black retaliation for slavery remained imminent in the minds of southern whites and the lynching of Bryant exemplified this fear.

Most of the wealthy people who then resided in Fauquier County were plantation owners. They went about their daily lives in a manner that seemed to be lazy and carefree.

Edward Marshall was the son of Chief Justice John Marshall. He was also a prominent lawyer.","A letter from 1830 related some of the events that were going on in Fauquier County during this time period. Edward Carrington Marshall's brother tried to negotiate an exchange of land with a Mr. Noland. Mr. Noland was also important man in Fauquier County.

The Tuskegee Institution invited the black community to witness what work the school has turned out, how that work is accomplished, and what is the character of the general population in which the raw material comes. Gathered in the hall were, perhaps a thousand colored people...mainly old-timers... including many who had journeyed more than 30 miles to view the spectacle. The audience listened to lesson recitals during the morning sessions and rhetorical exercises during the afternoon with perfect delight. The article also paid significant tribute to the inspiration behind the school, Principle Booker T. Washington. Washington, a man of unusual force and ability for any race, grew the school from the ground up with the aid of seed money from the state in the amount of 2,000. From this grant in 1881, Washington founded his school in a church with 30 students and one teacher. By 1887, the year the <em>New York Times</em> reported on the school, Tuskegee had grown to 275 students. With awe and reverence, the <em>New York Times</em> chronicled this communal gathering and paid their editorial respects to Washington for such a tremendous educational achievement. "," A vital piece of Alabama history lies in the foundation of the Tuskegee Institution. The institute's creation was intrinsically tied to Alabama state politics. The Bourbon Democrats gained control throughout Alabama between the years of 1874-1900. According to historian Allen Goings, the Democrats seized political control of Alabama in 1874 by waging a strenuous campaign based almost exclusively on the race issue. In strategic political move, W.F. Foster, a Democratic candidate for the Alabama Senate, traded black votes with a promise to create a school for the African American community. Under Washington's leadership Tuskegee admitted its first class of 30 students in 1881. Washington had his students build the Tuskegee Institution with their own hands to prove labor as both practical and dignified. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, in advocating hard work and teaching practical skills, Washington hoped to see his race rise through gradual and nonconfrontational change. "," Through Tuskegee, the nation witnessed the beginnings of racial change. <em>The New York Times</em> praised the creation of Tuskegee in the middle of one of the darkest and most hopeless parts of the South. Booker T. Washington had a vision of his black community rising through the ranks of society and Tuskegee proved a first step.

J.M Neal purchased a large amount of corn from Trice and stayed at the store until 1A.M. when he boarded a train for Pulaski, Tennessee.  Authorities suspected that Warren and his accomplices entered the store at 2 A.M and killed Trice in order to rob the store of money and dry goods. Locals discovered that a  rainy night left footprints leading to Warren's house.  Before authorities could question the African American community, a mob took Warren a mile down the road and hanged him.       Despite the circumstantial evidence facing Warren for the murder of a white man, blacks rarely experienced justice in courtrooms when the crime involved a white man.  Southerners who favored lynching worried that a lengthy jail sentenced prolonged death and allowed African Americans to seek divine forgiveness. Warren's case was just one of several thousand lynching cases after the Civil War.  In many cases, angry mobs grabbed the first black man a bloodhound came across. Before trials could occur, mobs stormed jails and grabbed black men.  Local  judges and police were either involved or submitted to  mob  justice.       With the promise of racial equality created by voting rights, lynching attempted to create the same racial order that existed under slavery. Lynching was rare before the Civil War because slaveholders did not want to destroy their own property.  After Emancipation, Southern whites feared that the younger generation of African Americans born outside of slavery had not yet learned the code of deference and submission in the South. One black observer believed that lynching set an example, knowing full well that one Negro swinging from a tree will serve as well as another to terrorize the community.        Rural areas such as Warren County in Tennessee typically had the highest numbers of lynchings in the South.  There were strong racial tensions in rural areas where there was an influx of new African American settlers that the white community was unfamiliar with. These strange niggers, as they were labeled, did not have anyone in the white or black community to vouch for their character.   Southern Kentucky, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas were rural states  that also had the highest lynching rates in the South.    In Warren County, it would have been difficult for law enforcement to protect Wesley from a furious mob.  Since the majority of lynching occurred in secrecy at remote locations in the South, historians will never know the exact number of lynching victims, but they estimate that it was around five thousand.

The Union troops arrived at her home and stole guns, clothing, bonds, and the watches from two slaves, Sue and Mammy E. Louisa was so alarmed at their behavior that she was afraid for her safety. She found Union officers who protected her, but the threat of violence from Union soldiers was real. Louisa Minor experienced fear that day felt all over the South as Union and Confederate troops passed through widespread communities. Like others, Louisa Minor remained defiant.","The destructive force the war had for civilians surfaced as early as in Fredericksburg, Virginia between December 11 and 15 1862. Fredericksburg had been occupied by Confederate sharpshooters slowing the Union advance, so the Union troops probably felt justified in their action. Looting in the town occurred to a severe degree as the entire contents of houses was thrown into the street. The greatest loss felt by southern women like Louisa Minor was the loss of loved ones on the battlefield. Among Virginians alone, 20-30,000 men died in the war, while by 1862 alone there were 42,000 claims for back-pay by families of deceased soldiers. The suffering and fear felt by Louisa Minor and her family in Albemarle County was just a small part of the broader suffering the war brought to American civilians.","Louisa Minor's personal humiliation at the hands of Union troops repeated itself all across the Confederacy, as the movements of Union and Confederate armies initiated destruction of civilian property from Virginia to Louisiana. In Virginia, Gen. Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 devastated that area's ability to provide food for the Confederacy. Sheridan waged war on the ability of the Confederate population to resist, a method emulated all over the Confederacy by Union forces. Significant resistance by Confederate guerillas forced Sheridan to be even more extreme. Between late September and late October 1864 Sheridan systematically destroyed the Shenandoah Valley's ability to feed Confederate troops. Far from Virginia Benjamin Butler brought the war to the doorstep of Confederate civilians early in the Civil War by confiscating private property in New Orleans after the Union took that city in 1862. Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's offensive into northern Alabama in 1864 was actually more severe than Sherman's in Georgia though it achieved less renown. Confederate units and deserters from both sides also inflicted severe hardship on the Confederate civilian population.

The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

More and more of her former slaves left her land as 1866 began. She felt sad to see people go whom she had known all her life. Louisa Minor mentioned in her diary the change in everyday life as the ex-slaves departed. She stated that though ice was available outside, no one brought it inside, because there were no servants left to do the work. She wrote as if that kind of labor was totally foreign to her. Louisa Minor respected the right of her former slaves to leave the plantation, but she had trouble seeing her ex-house slaves go. When she described her children's nanny, Nancy, as well as other former house slaves named Mammy, and Aunt Peggy, she revealed the reason for her sadness, constant proximity. White slave-owners gained closer relationships with their slaves when those slaves were working alongside them. When her freed slaves left her land, Louisa Minor and her children found the absence of those they spent time with everyday to be the hardest to bear. ","This relationship between black and white women was a common element of slavery because of the nature of work done in whites' houses.

These relationships were sometimes worse for slaves because a cruel master could deride the slave all the time if they were always around. Thus Louisa Minor's pain at seeing her ex-house-slaves leave was an expression of the relationships by which whites took advantage of slaves while acting as if they were doing it out of good-natured paternalism. This of course had consequences throughout the South as freed slaves left their former masters' homes."],"display_date":"January 7, 1866 - January 13, 1866","search_date":"1866-01-10","locations":[{"id":13598,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2565,"title":"The Klan alters Congressional elections in Tennessee&#39;s 4th district \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"1871-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Representative Horace Maynard of Tennessee presented the investigation into the contested election between Republican Louis Tillman and Democrat C .A Sheafe before the United States House of Representatives.  Republicans charged that the Ku Klux Klan intimidated both white and black voters on behalf of the Democratic Party.  In that election, C.A Sheafe won close election 44176 to 3810, but the Republicans should have won a landslide with 7,800 newly registered black voters.  The House of Representatives agreed with the conclusion of widespread voter intimidation and passed a resolution that gave the seat to the Republicans.","To verify the Republican's claim of voter intimidation, officials interviewed numerous voters representing both parties and the evidence showed the KKK did prevent Republicans from reaching the polls. George McMichael, a former slave from Coffee County, reported that he returned home after voting for the Republican ticket and found the Klan waiting for him.  They tied him down on a log and whipped him two hundred times.  An African American by the name of Washington Ore testified that The Klan surrounded his home, but he escaped by jumping through his window. He said, they shot two shots at me, but did not hit me at that time. When he returned to his house, his crops were torn to pieces in retaliation for his Republican vote.  Although the Klan was a small organization that was unpopular in the early 1870s,  the organization gained strength and helped the Democrats win back the state government  by the late 1870s. ","Horace Maynard and the Republicans' effort to secure black voting rights in Tennessee was a political struggle in a divided region. The emergence of seven thousand new black voters threatened to break the even division between Republicans on the eastern part of the state and the agricultural interests of middle Tennessee.  Tennessee had a history as a moderate state before the Civil War when it voted for the Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell instead of the Democrats. The same radical group of Democrats that pushed the moderate state of Tennessee into the Civil War, turned to violence in the postwar years to prevent a Republican advantage. Each party tried to forcefully keep the other away from the polls.  George Brunlow disfranchised the old Democrats until 1867. Once the Democrats, returned to the polls, Brunlow reluctantly gave African Americans the right to vote in order to solidify Republican power.  Tennessee was the first state in the South to take the monumental step to allow African Americans to vote.  When the Klan desperately resorted to violence and intimidation to gain a political advantage, Governor Brunlow, refused to certify the results in Tillman vs. Sheafe election.  He stated,  the votes cast for a candidate are illegal and his election void and that the KKK have used violence and other means of intimidation to deter legal voters from exercising franchisement.  With a slim majority threatened, Republicans fought to secure black voting rights for political reasons rather than the moral cause of equality.  Similarly, the Klan showed that they were not primarily motivated by race when they attacked large numbers of white and black Republicans.  Tennessee Republicans were more concerned with building new industry than the impoverished condition of African Americans that did not improve under their administration.  Republicans knew that the Party of Lincoln did not need to help African Americans to guarantee their votes on election day.

The slave did not deny his crime and appeared to show no remorse at the time of his execution. The only excuse offered by Dave for this gruesome act was that he had been drinking before the time the act was committed. Those who were there to witness his hanging claimed that his demeanor was indifferent towards his fate, and that he even dared to smile at times. Between the daytime hours of twelve and two, Dave was publicly hung by the town sheriff. The body dangled for thirty minutes before it was cut down and buried. Upon his burial, many physicians from neighboring towns rushed to his grave site to be the first to claim the body for dissection. ","We do not know anything of the events that induced Dave to murder his master. Since Dave offered no excuse for his crime, one can only speculate upon his possible stimulus. Dave could have murdered him for any number of reasons. A sexual advance on a loved one by his owner, persuasion by another white man, or any other perceived injustice brought upon him could have provoked Dave to commit this deed. ","However valid the crime's impetus, the murder of a white man at the hands of a slave or person of color was considered a serious offense punishable by death. Historian Joshua Rothman argues that although most African Americans who murdered their masters were sentenced to hang, many were not forced to endure this harsh sentence due to the intervention of other whites in the town who could vouch for the particular slave's character. In the instance of Dave, however, this intervention did not occur. From the tone of the article announcing the hanging, Dave showed no remorse for what he had done. His indifferent attitude, the lack of significant reason for the crime he committed, and the apparent lack of respect received from the members of the white community most likely did not lend itself to an appeal for a more lenient sentence."],"display_date":"November 17, 1848","search_date":"1848-11-17","locations":[{"id":12441,"lat":36.2251619225,"lng":-82.4967689306,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2577,"title":"The Elite South are Immune\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-09-07","end_date":"1832-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A cholera epidemic struck the United States in 1834, affecting southerners in every social standing. However; elitism and negative racial attitudes ultimately influenced perceptions about the transmission of the disease. Todd Savitt, a historian specializing in nineteenth-century medicine and disease stated that white Virginians often related high morals, clean living and orthodoxy to immunity during the cholera epidemics. White paupers, free blacks, and slaves because of their sinful ways, degraded condition, and filthy habits were viewed as the prime targets for cholera. Whites, who may have revealed symptoms of Cholera, were often diagnosed with diarrhea, dysentery, or fever rather than to be diagnosed with the poor man's disease. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported the first case of malignant cholera in Richmond, it was not surprising to Virginians that the first victim was a slave boy. The master of the young boy wrote an urgent letter to the Richmond Department of Health describing symptoms of cholera and the condition of his dying slave. The young boy, an eleven year old subject to fits of diarrhea and incredibly dehydrated died a few hours later in the tobacco factory of his master. The young boy exhibited the principle symptoms of cholera: bouts of profuse diarrhea. The Richmond Board of Health traced the cause of cholera to the young boy's consumption of contaminated pears. The Richmond Board of Health would later publish statements connecting the supposedly crude eating habits of the underclass to cholera. "," Location rather than race and class attributed to the prevalence of cholera among free blacks, slaves, and lower class whites. According to Dhiman Barua and William Greenough, medical professors specializing in cholera epidemics, the cholera bacterium thrives in water ecosystems and transmits through the ingestion of water or food contaminated by fecal mater. Those living close to cities express high rates of vulnerability to the disease.  Transmission rates of cholera in the nineteenth-century South rose because of unsanitary conditions in newly developing cities. In Richmond, the James River and the Kanawha Canal provided opportunities for cholera to spread through low income homes and slave quarters. Free blacks, urban slaves and lower class whites throughout the South faced increased susceptibility to cholera that was attributed to densely populated housing, inefficient waste management systems and close proximity to local rivers, rather than race and class."],"display_date":"September 7, 1832","search_date":"1832-09-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2578,"title":"Freedom in Fauquier\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth Centuries, Fauquier County was a county with many African American slaves. However, Fauquier County was a county with a few freed African Americans. In 1820, the Fauquier County Census counted 11,167 slaves and 507 freed African Americans. In 1830, there were 12,612 slaves and only 621 freed African Americans. Therefore, in those 10 years, the number of slaves increased by 1,445 and the number of freed Blacks increased by only 114. ","Every freed African American that resided in Fauquier had to register. The person's name, age, color, and status were recorded. Also, if the person has any distinct marks on their body, the location of the mark was recorded. Some people listed had records of how they obtained freedom. Catherine White was 22 years old and 5 feet and 1 inch. She had two scars on her left arm between her elbow and her wrist. She was born free. Ceasor Madison was 68 years old and 5 feet 7 inches.

The total crop for the year for all four men was worth 2,033 dollars  Mr. Bills took 515 dollars for rent, or  twenty five percent of the four men's total crop.   These landless tenants had no choice but to accept the high rent that Bills offered.  Instead of growing his own crops, Bills relied on his dozens of tenants to farm his thousand acres and provide his substantial income.  While Bills returned comfortably to his home, his white and black tenants faced the  bleak economic reality of declining cotton prices. "," Unlike a crop-lien system, Bills charged a flat rate rent in order to reduce the risks associated with tenant farmers. The trend continued on a regional level in Georgia where the number of cash tenants grew from 18,000 in 1880 to 59,000 in 1900. At nearly seventy years old, Bills was too old to oversee that tenants properly tended to the cotton fields.  Although it seemed like a lucrative business, landowners found it difficult to keep tenants because farms competed for the lowest rent.  Heavily indebted tenants could leave unexpectedly without paying for goods that Bills provided.   With cash tenants, landowners did not need to keep a store or furnish any goods.   Landowners increasingly avoided the crop-lien system, as they did not want their tenants to rely on them for food to feed their families. Tenants knew how much they had to produce to meet their rent and landowners could isolate themselves from the harsh realities of tenant farming.  Since landowners did not have any personal stake in the success of their tenants, Bills could retire to a leisurely life of hunting and fishing instead of supervising the farm. ","Lower commodity prices caused by overproduction after the Civil War made farming a difficult life for  landless African Americans and whites.  More efficient cotton processing and new farming methods flooded the European and northern markets with cotton, corn and tobacco causing commodity prices to plummet.  Still, agriculture was firmly ingrained into the landscape of the South  for generations and industrial opportunities were scarce.   Recently emancipated African Americans with little education turned to the familiar cotton farming of the antebellum period. The lack of affordable land forced both white and black landless farmers  to accept high rent.  If there were blight or an early frost, tenant farmers risked not having enough money to feed their families. ","White landowners had a complicated relationship among white and black tenants.  If both the tenant and the owner were white, they enjoyed a closer relationship than with African Americans.  Landowners would often work aggressively to help their white tenants to succeed while having little contact with black tenants.  Black and white tenant farmers developed tensions when they competed for the best crops and the best land.  Whites especially resented successful black farmers who challenged white supremacy.  Even though believed they were racially superior to black tenant farmers, they were on the same economic ground.  In many ways tenant farming placed whites and blacks on equal ground. Increasingly, white tenant farmers felt stigmatized for sharing the same economic status as African Americans."],"display_date":"January 26, 1870","search_date":"1870-01-26","locations":[{"id":12066,"lat":35.2116486435,"lng":-88.9878590321,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDEMAN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2587,"title":"Lawlessness and terrorism in Wilson County, Tennessee","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-09-07","end_date":"1871-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Described as a well-liked African American in the community, Isaac Creek was attacked in his cabin in the middle of the night by a group of armed white men.   Creek fatally shot Thomas Lyons after refusing to surrender to the prowlers who attempted to burn down his cabin.  The Williamson County Journal's editor reacted with rage at what he viewed as intolerable lawlessness on the part of the band of young prowlers.  Although the white man Lyons was killed, the editor argued that Isaac Creek deserved the same right to protect his property from criminals that the law guaranteed regardless of color.  The editor proclaimed that the  whites who perpetrated the crime  disgraced the soil of our good county.         The editor of the Williamson County Journal felt that Isaac Creek's property rights were more important than upholding white supremacy.  Only six years earlier, Tennessee lost thousands of men fighting to preserve the property rights of all southern slaveholders.   Regardless of color, most whites supported anyone's right to self-defense from lawless criminals in the unpopular Ku Klux Klan. In the 1870s, the fact that Creek was a black who murdered a white man did not define the editor's opinion. The decade following the Civil War was before disfranchisement and legalized segregation made race the defining issue  southern justice.  Unlike The Atlanta Constitution that glorified racial violence, newspapers around the state of Tennessee condemned the  emerging Ku Klux Klan.  A large segment of the population of Tennessee were former Union loyalists and Republicans who were equally threatened by attacks from the Klan. The editor of the Williamson County Journal applauded Isaac Creek because the local community valued property rights and legal order more than upholding the racial order.         Stories such as Isaac Creek's show that race was not the defining issue of southern legal rights in the 1870s. During reconstruction, African Americans voted and gained representation in most southern states.  Tennessee was the first state to allow African Americans to vote in 1867.  Once union troops left the South in the late 1860s, former Confederates once again seized the power in the government.  Democrats ushered in a violent period of segregation and lynching that lasted until the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   Cases where African Americans had the same legal rights show that segregation and disfranchisement  were not  inevitable outcomes of emancipation.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

Many of them were one mass of rags, others are covered with a collection of patches which make them look like a traveling bed of quilts.  Although it was unclear from the article, the woman was likely part of a northern missionary group.   She focused on their peculiar religious practices rooted in African traditions.

","Northern missionaries encountered an illiterate and impoverished population of freed blacks in Tennessee that were very happy to be free despite their desperate conditions.  After the defeat of the Confederacy, religious scholars argued that God had delivered the slaves from physical and spiritual bondage.  Both white and black missionaries from the North came to the aid of freedmen who used religion to seek a better education.   Groups such as the American Missionary Association and the American Freedmen's Union Commission taught African Americans to read and write through Bible study.  They educated new black ministers to educate the freedmen so that they could move beyond the cycle of sharecropping and tenant farming.  This was a crucial development for freedmen plagued by tuberculosis and sharecropping agreements that made freed slaves dependent on their former masters.   For missionaries who lived a privileged life in the North, it was hard to believe freedom under harsh conditions was an improvement from a lifetime of slavery. ","Northern missionaries who came to the South in large numbers after the Civil War attempted to civilize African Americans by teaching them Christianity, but blacks adopted Christianity into their preexisting African religions.  Historians had to revise their earlier theory that generations of slavery removed African culture from African Americans.  The woman's account showed that African culture  still thrived in 1870.  Religious scholars have noted that once African Americans read the Bible, they easily adapted to the Evangelical Christian experience because it related to possession by spirits in many African religious traditions.   Most southern churches believed that the African American version of Christianity that was deeply rooted African religion was hethenistic  and barbaric.  Evangelical Christians, on the other hand, welcomed African Americans to experience conversion in an unorthodox way and did not chastise black converts the way other Christians did."],"display_date":"February 24, 1870 - February 28, 1870","search_date":"1870-02-26","locations":[{"id":11940,"lat":35.4928224111,"lng":-86.0722573506,"zoom":9,"place":"COFFEE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2604,"title":" Caution to Purchasers of Negros \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-05-20","end_date":"1826-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an 1826 article, an Alabama newspaper warned readers and slave buyers of an untrustworthy slave trader who dealt in kidnapped free blacks.

While the article states regret for the loss uncured on the purchaser, the article went on to harshly condemn the practice: If we would not have our brethren of the north harbor and protect our fugitive slaves who may escape hither, let us be prompt in restoring their free citizens who may be torn from them by the ruthless hand of lawless violence... ","   Paradoxical in the condemnation of lawless violence and the desired retrieval of their fugitive slaves, this article is evidence of southern complexities.  As Walter Johnson discusses in his book, <em>Soul by Soul,</em> while none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known... often state law holds them in bondage anyway.  The recommended route to restored freedom, the courts, prosecuted illicit slave trading yet such a suit required legal and financial support, luxuries most slaves lacked.   The <em>American Mirror</em> was harsh in its criticism of this vagabond slave trader, purporting such kidnappings as a universal wrong.  The article's assertion, that freedom so dear to every American and to which he, although of a different complexion, is no less entitled to than ourselves, is problematic.  Alabama writers used the argument of equality for free blacks without recognizing the hypocrisy of such statements.","     Slaveholders perceived themselves, as discussed by Johnson, as benevolent law-abiding citizens, in contrast to wicked law-breaking slave traders.  Using proslavery rhetoric to justify human bondage, slaveholders told themselves they were rescuing slaves from the slave market or ill-treatment.  Here in similar ways, humane gentlemen, saw themselves as heroes to these northern black freemen, just as they perceived themselves as benevolent father-figures to their human chattel."],"display_date":"May 20, 1826","search_date":"1826-05-20","locations":[{"id":7079,"lat":30.3227252079,"lng":-88.4311231118,"zoom":9,"place":"JACKSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2607,"title":"An African Colony in Canada \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As early as 1816, Maryland and other Southern states pleaded with the federal government to procure a site for the colonization of free blacks.

Many chapters of the American Colonization Society advocated the creation of Liberia, an area on the tip of Africa, as a homeland for freed slaves while other chapters were interested in establishing a colony in Canada, Central America, and/or Haiti. Following the colonization trends of the time, the Richmond Enquirer reported in 1830 that Ohio will send good slaves to Canada. In Ohio, and in other areas across the South, whites became fearful of the ever increasing free and slave population. Trustees of the Cincinnati, Ohio Township met to discuss a plan to address citizen concerns and ultimately decided to peruse African colonization in Canada. The trustees expect that over 1000 slaves and mulattos will travel to the Canada and once there, the British government would have jurisdiction over the new arrivals. Charles, Maryland headquarters for the Organization of the Maryland Colonization Society, would subsequently advocate for the colonization of free blacks to Canada a few months later. "," Maryland experienced rapid growth of its free black population in the early 1800s. According to Walsh and Fox, historians of Maryland culture, the diverse agriculture of Maryland, the presence of manufacturing and the extensive development of railroads attracted many free blacks to the area. By 1830, the black population in Maryland increased by 150 percent. Free blacks experienced more personal freedom in Maryland and could marry, own property, fill suit in court, and operate businesses. Culturally, southern Maryland resembled that of other Southern states and free blacks easily acclimated to their new environments. "," White fears of black rebellion and future integration of free blacks into white society promoted of the idea of free black colonization in Maryland. Members of the Organization of the Maryland Colonization Society believed the removal free blacks from the area to Canada would alleviate white racial tensions and fear.

Templeman and Goodwin of Richmond, Virginia, January 2 to the 31 in 1857 was a time of rather lucrative business.They sold a great deal of merchandise and had made a significant amount of profit.  In fact, their sales business had seen mostly boon time since they first established in Richmond in 1849.   However, for their merchandise, times were not so good.  They found their families torn apart and their bodies broken; Templeman and Goodwin were slave traders, and their merchandise was human beings.  During the aforementioned period, 33 slaves were sold for a total profit of 12,390.  This was a very large amount of money at this time.  The slaves were sold individually at prices ranging from 700 to 1000 on average.  It is interesting to note that when slaves were sold, only the name of the buyer was listed, that of the slave was omitted.  It was as if the traders wanted to forget that a particular slave ever existed.  Slaves' names were listed when they were first acquired; however, only a temporary first name was entered and an identification number assigned along with it, in what appears to be a tactic for dehumanization.  ","    As a centrally located major southern city, Richmond was a bustling slave trade market.  Traders would often come from the Tidewater area by way of the James River with slaves from all around the South.  The James also served as a highway in the opposite direction as well, with Richmond born slaves being moved to ports such as Norfolk to be sent to the Deep South.  Slave traders themselves were a varied group.  Some were rather unscrupulous men who sought to achieve great wealth quickly and had reputations for overabsuing their charges.  However, other slave traders were working in what they considered a family business.  They often took great pride in their work and on their reputations of delivering high quality slaves at reasonable prices.  In a fashionable metropolis such as Richmond, there can be no doubt that more then a few of the elite citizenry were heavily involved in the slave trade.  In fact, as this ledger indicates, both Templeman and Goodwin would have been in the upper strata of wealth in Richmond due to their very high income.

A Mississippi man's letters include harrowing murders, vigilante activity and a purported slave insurrection.  Rattled by the violence, the Mississippian, James Carlson, in a letter to his former schoolmate, Virginian Robert Whitehead, detailed the events with fear and warning.  Lawless men brutally murdered a mutual friend on his plantation. In the wake of the violence, white vigilante groups raided and hung gamblers in Vicksburg, while others uncovered and hung slave conspirators planning a massive insurrection.   ","      The Vicksburg Volunteers, as the self-selected white male Mississippians called themselves, did not wait for the slow and uncertain arm of the law rather, they hung the villains who upset social order.  Vigilante groups, as characterized by Richard Brown in <em>A Strain of Violence</em>, developed in the absence of effective law and order in the frontier region. According to Carlson, vigilante violence continued in Madison County, where an insurrection movement among Negros was discovered...and by all accounts...12 Negros and two white men were hung in the manner of Vicksburg. [After they were hung, the insurrectionists were left hanging for 24 hours as an example.]  Many more both Negros and whitemen (who were at the head of it) have been taken and put in prison.  These are harsh measures but the times require them.  In Madison, Hinds, Warren and Yazoo, the greatest excitement prevails and armed patrols are moving in every direction. Armed patrols were not site-specific to Mississippi. ","      Brown argues, vigilante groups, in this case the Vicksburg Volunteers and the armed patrols, fit into an American doctrine of vigilance, used in early 19th century crises of war and expansion.  Recalling historical precedent (in the 1810's vigilante groups formed in Virginia as a home guard during War of 1812 and in 1817 Florida when threatened by a Spanish-Mexican navy) and propagating a democratic ideal of popular sovereignty harking back to the American Revolution, vigilante groups saw themselves as uniquely American--lawless but justified. ","      In Mississippi, the vigilantes were as Brown described, upright and ambitious frontiersmen who wished to re-establish the values of a property holder's society. Subversive behavior, especially among slaves and poor white men, disquieted the social order and pushed Carlson to lament: the times are indeed alarming.

Soon afterwards, he acquired old parts of spelling books, which he mastered with but little difficulty. His brother, excited by this, tried to learn as well, as well as some friends. George was smarter than his brother, and he became a far better reader than he; every Sunday during the year, he would go off by himself and would stammer over the dim syllables in his spelling book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of another. He would scarcely spare the time to return to ordinary meals, being so engaged with the book.

According to her, anti-literacy laws were rarely enforced, and most white Southern slaves were indifferent to the issue of slave literacy. In fact, by permitting slaves to read the Bible and thus providing them a path to salvation, many slave owners may have assuaged their consciences about the harsh ways in which they treated their human properties.

In 1881, Walter Rountree took a walk one day from the University of Georgia with his brother and some of his friends. They encountered two African American men at the town courthouse and a conflict ensued. All the men drew their pistols against one another. In the shooting that followed, Walter Rountree was shot and later died after being carried back to his home. There was almost a riot in the town because the students were upset with the African American men. An examination of the pistols used proved that the gun that killed Rountree belonged to his own brother. However, the African American men involved in the conflict were tried for assault with intent to murder [and] found guilty. ","Georgia's society in 1881 had a guideline for social interactions between blacks and whites that were regulated by strict laws and customs. Because African Americans and whites were living in areas very close to each other and there was still animosity among these southerners, whites felt that it was necessary to have these laws to prevent conflict. The research of Edward Ayers shows that southern whites thought that blacks were to blame for the violence and that black men were...inclined toward...crimes of passion. The laws would help to keep their passions under control and prevent violence. Ayers discovered that some of the social customs that blacks had to observe were that African Americans could not address whites by their first names and could not socialize with white members of society. Since Rountree's community in Athens, Georgia was composed of blacks and whites, it is not unusual that a conflict resulted between him and his white friends and the African Americans in their town. ","African Americans were in a disadvantaged position in Georgia's society, especially concerning the law. The account of this event puts the blame for the conflict completely on the two African American men involved, although there was probably much confusion among all the men. Then the two black men were found guilty for assaulting the white men, but there was no mention of any punishment for the white men. Professor Ayers found that there were many laws created that discriminated against African Americans in society, such as vagrancy and labor laws.

After making such observations, they researched the reports made by the Georgia State Board of Examiners about Atlanta University. The Board found that the school created capable students who were equal in their maturity of thought and... ease of expression to students from white universities. The travelers also asked one of the professors if he perceived a difference in learning ability of black students based on the darkness of a student's skin color.

","As outsiders observing Georgia's society, the two men visiting the area made judgments on the African American education system and noted how whites and blacks made judgments about each other. African Americans proved that they were capable of creating a successful educational environment and creating successful students. The research of historian James M. McPherson shows that education in the South during this time period was not up to desired national standards for whites or blacks because of the huge numbers of all southerners not receiving any education. McPherson also noted that because schools were segregated, it was difficult for African Americans to receive an equal education that students received at white universities. The state was forced to try to create equal education standards because separate equality was demanded by law. The Georgia State Board of Examiners may have declared that the school was able to produce black students of equal learning ability in order to avoid punishments from the federal government if they had provided unequal educational opportunities. Since the white men who were outsiders to the area made a judgment similar to the State Board of Examiners, however, there was probably truth to the statement.

","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women.

They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy.

A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy.

These policies left the state governments that were controlled by Republicans in charge of distributing the capital in ways to improve the economy. This made the situation more complicated by creating opportunities for corruption. According to Lewis Nicholas Wynne, people in Governor Bullock's office had the opportunity to accept bribes and Bullock was able to use the capital to reward loyal followers as patronage, which made many people suspicious of corruption in his policies. Democrats were unhappy with the Republicans because of their supposedly corrupt practices and the harsh policies of Reconstruction. The political tensions between both parties made it easy to start accusing people of corrupt practices, especially the governor.","Railroads were the focus of Southerners' attention during the years after Reconstruction. According to the research of Edward Ayers, there were many reasons why the railroads had such an impact on society. First, he showed that the creation of railroads that would stretch across the country created the need for making time zones and creating a standard time. Also, he noted that the railways were important for bringing commerce to the South that created new towns. This commercial aspect of Southern towns made them more similar to Northern towns and allowed them to assimilate with the rest of the nation. Another impact that Ayers noted was the creation of segregation laws concerning the railways. White men disapproved of the idea of black men being able to sit near white women because of the threat of sexuality between whites and blacks. Thus, Ayers wrote, the more closely linked to sexuality, the more likely was a place to be segregated. Railroads were growing in importance in society because they affected many different aspects of people's lives."],"display_date":"1870 - 1875","search_date":"1872-12-31","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2674,"title":"Runaway Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-10-10","end_date":"1820-10-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the worse things that could happen to a slaveholder was to have one of their slaves run away. They ran away for many reasons. They suffered from the brutal treatment of their master. They sought to be reunited with relatives or friends that lived in the North. They could run away just to experience the taste of freedom that had been stripped away from them. Most slave holders posted news about their runaways in the local newspapers. Most of the rewards for these fugitive slaves ranged from 100-1,000 dollars. The value of the slave depended on how crucial the slave was to the slaveholder. In Fairfax County one such notice reported that a slave named William Lee, described as a bright mulatto who had escaped from the plantation of Virginia slaveholder WM. H. Guenell. Lee was 25 years of age and 5 foot 9 inches tall. He had a scar near his right eye and another scar that was the size of a half dollar on his thigh. He was reported in the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> as traveling with another black man darker in complexion than Lee. Lee could read and write. His master believed that Lee would be traveling to Pennsylvania to obtain free papers and change his name. Many slaves ran away to escape the cruel activities of their masters.

This African American Church weekly asked various members to leave for misconduct.  Leaving may have constituted leaving the service that Sunday, or leaving the fellowship of that congregation.  It is unclear whether the church allowed them to reenter the Guilfield Baptist Church, however, some weeks; deacons visited the expelled members.  It is also undetermined if the church members were free people."," The church notes documenting the business of the Guilfield Baptist church began in the 1820s.  This was a time when the United States was undergoing a religious revival, called the Great Awakening.  This movement made protestant religions, such as Methodist and Baptist, very popular among whites as well as African Americans.  Prior to this period religious dialogue between whites and African Americans was for slaves to obey their masters as the bible instructed.  In many areas African Americans became active in integrated services and became morally or spiritually equal to whites, who believed that all men were sinners.   African Americans may have taken ownership of these protestant religions for many reasons beyond a growing acceptance in some congregations.  The revivalist trend in the Great Awakening was similar to the African religious ceremonies which frequently had highly emotional praise, congregational responses, as well as sprinkling or dipping with water for initiation. Due to the Great Awakening, some congregations embraced African Americans in a more equal capacity, however most Southern congregations did not.  In the later congregations African Americans who gained confidence through religion proved to be a threat to whites.  In the first half of the nineteenth century, several slave rebellions in the South were divinely inspired.  Two famous religious conspiracies were lead by Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner.  Nat Turner's plan came to fruition leaving Whites nationwide in fear of religious African Americans."],"display_date":"June 30, 1827","search_date":"1827-06-30","locations":[{"id":13775,"lat":37.0773707286,"lng":-77.6296507153,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2685,"title":"Missionaries in Africa:  Teaching the Hottentots to Read the Bible\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-07-23","end_date":"1817-07-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Star of Petersburg Virginia recognized George Schmidt, a Dutch missionary, for his outstanding missions in South Africa on July 23, 1817.

In order to help this concern, The American Colonization Society was founded in 1817. Border States such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia had the most chapters because of their locations and ideas about slavery. In Virginia, many prominent men were members of this society, including James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hartwell Cocke of Fluvanna Country. The Society was a national club and needed to keep its members bonded together on one common cause. One way that they accomplished this was to send out a newsletter called the Circular. "," The 1819 Circular, informed John Cocke of a colony that was in the works of being established in Africa so that the Society could finally put its thoughts into action. Despite only being two years old at the time, the society already had strong ideas and a plan to bring about colonization. They worked out their plan in great detail to ensure that it would work and go over well; they knew minute details such as which port the slaves would leave from and where the former slaves were going. The colony that the Circular publicized was Liberia. In 1821, Liberia became the colony of African American colonization in Africa; the city of Monrovia was the major city of this colony, named for President James Monroe. This letter was an informational letter sent to all of the members to show progress in this endeavor; many other letters followed to keep the members posted on development in the project."," This Colony was formed out of fear that if slavery were abolished and the slaves were left in America as freedmen, they would revolt against their former owners. Virginia, Cocke's home state, was the first place in America to hold slaves and had already experienced turmoil from unhappy slaves. Virginians feared slave revolts like the Gabriel Revolt of 1800 and the Denmark Vessey Revolt in Haiti in 1822. They feared that since they had held slaves for so long that they slaves would have a strong vengeance against the slave owners. Colonization seemed like the perfect alternative; it would slowly ease the slave holders away from slavery and get the enslaved people away from the land of their former masters and back to their homeland."," Colonization was a dominate idea in the United States in the era before the Civil War. Some southerners favored colonization because they did not want to have their slaves turn on them after they were freed, and northerners did not want African Americans in their country because of racist feelings that were prevalent in the North in the early nineteenth century. Both regions could agree on this alternative to abolition, despite their obvious differences about slavery. The American Colonization Society combined these regional fears into a club with a common cause that all Americans could relate to and support."],"display_date":1819,"search_date":"1819-07-02","locations":[{"id":13904,"lat":37.7601235969,"lng":-77.4908797136,"zoom":9,"place":"HANOVER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2710,"title":"Lands Key in Social Standing\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-03-02","end_date":"1893-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On March 2, 1893, the land would be handed down from the Jerdone and Coleman family to the Archer Williams. The deed needed to be witnessed, signed, and sealed. The land was 132 acres and all the boundaries were listed. Land was essential in social standing and those with land were of higher class than those who weren't even if they were of different races. "," Land not only provided social standing, but it also was vital to the economy of the South. According to Edward Ayers, ideally a farmer of either race was able to work his way up the 'agricultural ladder' from landless laborer to sharecropper to renter to landowner. There were many ways to acquire land; like Archer Williams, it could be handed down within a family. An adolescent boy could also move to a landowner's farm to learn the practices of running of a farm, prove that he is a dependable worker, and earn a daily wage. Once he earned the trust of his employer or another landowner, he could become a sharecropper. Sharecroppers had responsibility for a plot of land and could earn money on their crops from the local market. Renters, on the other hand, paid for the use of a plot of land, provided their own tools and work animals, and could plant any crops they desired. They risked the possible losses, however. Once either the sharecropper or the renter saved enough, they could buy their own farm. No matter which way the farmer acquired his land, his main goal was to have his own farm."," Agriculture and crops were a major source of income for many Southerners. More and more blacks were acquiring land, and by 1900 although still many more whites had farms, 45 percent of blacks had land along the coasts, compared to the 70 percent of whites. The usage of land was different depending on its location and its environment. In the lower south, including Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains and also Southern Virginia, the area was the best suited for agricultural purposes. On the Eastern shore after the Civil War, farmers diversified their crops, so that if a crop failed that year, it did not mean that they would suffer incredibly. This trend was common all over the South after the war.

As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount?s claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent.

This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

Despite notices of Joe's capture, Sheriff French Strother was unable to prove the certainty behind his claim, because no one from Miss. Rust's estate came forward to verify his freedom or to prove he was their property. Without proof that Joe was either free or enslaved Sheriff Strother concluded that he was a runaway. A public auction for Joe's re-sale into slavery was then scheduled for January 2nd, 1841 at the Rappahannock County Courthouse.  Sheriff Strother advertised in the local paper that Joe would be sold to the highest bidder, to be paid for in cash.  Joe had no voice within the law.  Even if he was telling the truth, Sheriff Strother could not let him go free without proof of what he said was true.  Why would Strother believe him to be telling the truth anyway?  Joe would have seen the benefit in lying, in that he could have been freed on the off chance that they believed him or if he was a runaway, saying he was free would have delayed his trial at the very least.  In spite of his being free or not, the lack of proof sent Joe to the auction block and back into slavery.

Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2733,"title":"Equal Educations?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-05-27","end_date":"1887-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Mr. Mathews opened the letter.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O. Allen and Clayton E.

Delivered by Benjamin Morgan Palmer of the First Presbyterian Church, this sermon advocated southern secession in defense of its providential trust to perpetuate slavery. Palmer believed that slaves were by nature incapable of self government and dependent upon their masters for protection. Dr. Palmer's reasoning is sound, sensible, and Christian to Wadley who yearned for the South's fighting for the patriarchal cause of slavery. Dr. Palmer justified slavery through the patriarchy of a white slaveholder who protected the dependent slave. Wadley's opinions were typical of the Lower South during the days after Abraham Lincoln's presidential election, and sectionalism grew quickly and passionately, even in women's minds. According to Samuel S. Hill and Charles H. Lippy, Palmer's sermons on slavery, namely this famous oration, led to his position as the elected moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America. Wadley listened to Palmer with attentiveness and respect; she, like many other white southerners, believed in the doctrine of slavery as a divine right from God granted to the South. Wadley relates another sermon from a Dr. Lord, which summarizes the mistaken piety of abolitionists in their attempts to emancipate enslaved people from southern masters. Dr. Lord derived his preaching from Isaiah, and he condemned those who setting up their own judgement and their own code of morals instead of religion, and the scriptures, condemn that which has been sanctioned both by the bible, and by ancient usage. This sermon reflects the religious doctrine of southern clergymen prior to and possibly during the Civil War.

A. Tayloe sat down by the fireplace to read the correspondence he had picked up. Today he received the latest news from a friend he had not seen in a long time, N. H. Hudson. As he read over the news, it was once again, as usual, all about how Mr. Hudson's planting season was going. In this particular letter, Mr. Hudson had finally gotten around to planting his cotton and he still intended to plant more cotton among the other things he was cultivating. Despite his general complaints about the weather, like the rain and his difficulty with getting the planting done as well as getting into town, Mr. Hudson seemed to be in good health as was his family. He discovered in this letter as well that Hudson was not going to be going into town quite as frequently as before because of the lack of service provided by the mail system so he would not be picking up his correspondence quite as frequently. ","After the Civil War was over, a primary concern for many was that without slave labor, it became more difficult to be prosperous agriculturally. For example, in Hudson's life, without slaves, planting and agriculture took over most aspects of his life. He became much more conscious of the weather patterns to the point that he began informing his friends about those in correspondence. As many farmers were feeling the same pressures Mr. Hudson was facing where agriculture dominated their lives, organizations like the Agricultural Wheel or the Farmer's Alliance developed. These groups claimed to stand for the interests of small producers and drew on the political support of the Greenbackers. Both of these institutions attempted to improve the farmer's standing in the competitive marketplace. Michael Holt says that even though these institutions excluded blacks, the blacks were also able to mobilize on their own to achieve some of the same things in the field of agriculture.

The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.  Ayers argues that whites gave black voters a great deal of credit when dry forces won because of their perception of blacks as swing voters.  Nevertheless, the black voters were also held responsible when the dry forces lost.

He was later released for lack of evidence. On the following Saturday, December 30, an unknown group of people sought retribution for the alleged robbery and bombarded Gray's home, pounding violently on the door and walls of his house. No serious outcome resulted from that night's altercation, but the party returned to Gray's home on the following evening, repeated the hostility, and demanded that Gray come out to discuss his thievery. Gray refused to appear, and members of the group tore a plank of wood from Gray's door and repeatedly shot into the house through the hole. Gray received bullet wounds in the arm and stomach and died from his injuries. A man named Jim Williams also received serious wounds in the gunfire, as a shot in the forehead resulted in his death five days later. Calvin's stepson received a bullet wound in the leg, but was not fatally injured. Nine or ten people were arrested for their involvement in the bombardment, but all were released for lack of proof of their involvement. ","Gray's story reveals the disparate attitudes that whites possessed toward African Americans in Hawkins   County, Tennessee in the nineteenth century. The Hawkins County legal system treated Gray fairly, dismissing his crime for lack of proof and releasing him even though he was black. However, Gray's murderers did not grant him the same respect, as they violently assaulted him for unproven petty thievery. Gray's death displays the duplicitous nature of many southern whites in the late nineteenth century, as Gray's killers repaid an apparent legal injustice with an even more repulsive injustice. While Gray's killers believed his alleged robbery required retribution, they defied the legal system by punishing Gray outside of the system and by enacting a punishment egregiously disproportionate to the crime. ","Gray's murder served as an informal, citizen-organized judicial system, fulfilling historian Edward Ayers' argument that whites lynched alleged black offenders in the nineteenth century to uphold their perception of justice and to terrorize blacks into acquiescence. While the white mob did not lynch Gray, they terrorized him and might have lynched him if he had succumbed to their demands to exit his house. Instead, he was killed by gunshot for allegedly stealing a few hogs. Ayers argues that the majority of lynched African Americans in the nineteenth century South were tortured and killed for charges of murder, rape, or violation of white womanhood; however, Calvin Gray was hunted down, terrorized, and killed for the alleged robbery of a few hogs. Such disproportionate punishment suggests that some whites in the late nineteenth century possessed an even more severe hatred for blacks than previous accounts indicate.

On the night of his execution, Pratt was provided with spiritual advice in preparation for his execution.  While get readying himself for death, Pratt confessed to the crime for the first time.  At 12:00 a.m., thirty guards escorted Pratt out of the jail to the gallows near downtown Marietta.  The guards allowed Pratt to smoke a cigar, and they talked pleasantly amongst each other.  When Pratt arrived at the gallows, 8,000 people were waiting to witness his execution.  After an African American minister recited a prayer, Pratt publicly confessed his crime and expressed a willingness to die.  At 12:45 a.m., the drop fell, his neck broke, and he completely stopped moving thirteen minutes later.  The guards cut down Pratt's body, giving it to his father, brothers, and sisters who witnessed the execution.","Pink Pratt's execution demonstrates an uncommon instance when a nineteenth-century southern judicial system legitimately accused, convicted, and punished a black man according to the law, even though he committed a violent crime against a white female.  While a white perpetrator may have received a lighter punishment, Pratt was treated in a reasonably fair manner, considering the usual treatment of black offenders in the late nineteenth-century American South.  Pratt was executed as a criminal who committed a heinous offense, but the legal system fairly granted him the traditional religious rituals that it granted white offenders upon their execution.  The nineteenth-century Cobb County judicial system deemed a black criminal worthy of humane treatment, despite the horror of his crime.  ","Pratt's story challenges the traditional account of white reactions to black violent crime against whites.  As historian Edward Ayers argues, southern whites in the post-Civil War era were convinced that blacks were more dangerous than whites and that black men were more inclined to commit crimes of passion.  Nevertheless, the <em>National Police Gazette </em>did not portray Pratt as an atrocious creature, but depicted him talking pleasantly to his guards and expressing a willingness to die for his crime.  He was not portrayed as the brutal, dangerous monster that many southern whites declared blacks to be.  In addition, the public allowed his execution to occur through the legal process.  Ayers argues that black criminals were frequently kidnapped from jails, tortured, burned, and hanged by white mobs because whites believed such blacks were unworthy of legal execution.  However, Pratt was allowed to die through legal execution even though he raped a twelve-year-old white girl.  According to Ayers, whites often justified a lynching simply because the black offender committed the usual crime of sexual assault upon white women.  Whites assumed that black men lusted after white women and they even justified lynching blacks when they committed a minor violation of white womanhood.  Nevertheless, despite Pratt's severe violation of the dignity of an innocent white child, he was permitted to die through formal execution.

As Ayers argues that some people within churches tried to reach across racial divides, Walton broke through those divides by teaching the needy children of Alabama. Walton felt great tolerance and even love for his schoolchildren, as he perceived his work as a call from God to help the children plagued by injustice.  In addition, Walton's experience fulfills what historian Robert Handy calls the most significant development in evangelical volunteerism in the post-Civil War era: the growth of Sunday school work lead by lay teachers.  Walton's principal distinction was his expansion of this pattern of Sunday school teaching to African American children in Alabama.

The woman worked for an upstanding white family in Georgia and experienced continuing skin lightening for many months.  White spots covered her face and body, slowly enlarging and spreading across her skin.  The spots gradually bleached her skin, making her appear white.  The woman was apparently in good health and did not suffer from any illness other than the seemingly harmless skin disease.  The woman was not fearful or anxious about the dangers of the disease, because she felt no pain or discomfort from the ailment.","The Saturday Evening Post carried the African American woman's story, entitling it Freaks of Nature.  The woman's story appeared in the article alongside accounts of strange and unusual animals that committed extraordinary feats.  Thus, the article dehumanized the African American woman, comparing her to abnormal animals.  The article declared that the woman's skin disease created a wonderful transformation, by turning a black woman's skin white.  The article suggested that white skin was preferable to black skin and implied that the woman's skin disease was truly a blessing for her.  Thus, the article glorified the white skin, while vilifying black skin.","  The Marietta woman's story reveals that the majority of nineteenth-century white Southerners, and white Americans in general, upheld the superiority of white skin.  Historian Edward Ayers argues that no matter how clean, well-dressed, or well-mannered African Americans were, whites continued to associate them with a sense of pollution.  The whites' idea that the Marietta woman's skin disease was a wonderful transformation suggests that whites saw black skin as polluted and inferior to white skin.  As the article declared her disease to be wonderful, the articles' author assumed that the black woman preferred to have white skin, never considering that she might have seen the disease as unfortunate and undesirable.  In addition, the Marietta woman's story supports historian James C. Cobb's argument that white southerners created the identity of the black individual by deeming blacks inferior to whites because of the color of their sin.  By promoting their own skin color, whites in the South and throughout America denigrated black skin and black identity, preventing African Americans from forming their own identities for themselves and forcing them to perceive themselves as inferior."],"display_date":1884,"search_date":"1884-07-01","locations":[{"id":1678,"lat":33.9414430151,"lng":-84.5767277131,"zoom":10,"place":"COBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2752,"title":"Emily Austin Endorses Industrial Education for African Americans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-01","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the 1870's, Northerner Emily Austin founded the Austin School for African American children in Knoxville, Tennessee. When Austin moved into an African American neighborhood, the white community in Knoxville ostracized her for her work and the area in which she lived. While the community did not object to educating African Americans, they believed that only a very destitute and lowly woman would fraternize with blacks. Initially, Austin worked under the Freedman's Bureau, but when the Bureau was dissolved, she financed the school with personal funds and donations from northern friends. When the school became overcrowded, she erected a large schoolhouse, which she donated to the city, requiring that it always be used to educate African American students. In 1881, Austin grew to believe that she needed to reform her curriculum, as she believed that teaching the arts and sciences left the black students idle, thriftless, and contemptuous of work. Thus, Austin began to declare that industrial training was the only practical education for African Americans, because African Americans could only find employment in the industrial sector. She established industrial training for her students in the departments of sewing, gardening, domestics, and carpentry, but she faced much opposition from the students' parents. The African American parents opposed their children studying different subjects than white children. Austin continued to teach the industrial classes, but split the school day into sections of traditional teachings and industrial teachings.","Austin faced much difficulty in her profession, as both whites and blacks snubbed her for work. Austin said that her greatest difficulty was the African American opposition to her work, but she continued to educate her students because of her strong belief in the importance of industrial education for African Americans. Austin argued that African Americans held a great disadvantage in professional studies, making it impossible for them to compete with white students and gain professional positions. She also argued that education in the arts and sciences lead black students to despise manual labor. Thus, she argued that African Americans needed industrial training to convince them that good, honest work was the only way to make them good citizens. ","Historian Edward Ayers argues that the majority of educated African Americans in the South were limited to employment in manual labor because of their skin color. Ayers states that many educated African Americans despised manual labor, as they believed they were wasting their education if they accepted such work. This hatred explains Austin's belief that educated African Americans had grown to despise the only kind of labor they could acquire, leading her to assert the necessity of African American industrial teaching."],"display_date":"1881 - 1883","search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":12158,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2763,"title":"Liberia and American Colonization Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-06-27","end_date":"1858-06-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After reading the works of John C.

Susan said that her mother believed that white slave owners were the real slaves in the relationship. Having slaves required added work and responsibility for slave holders that outweighed the benefits. It was her preference that all the slaves be freed and sent to Liberia. Susan responded to her mother by telling her that she would miss her slave, Lulu, if she were sent to Liberia.

They argued that being a slave holder was, in fact, an agonizing personal burden. The American Colonization Society said that not only was being a slave holder overly demanding, but simply freeing slaves was impossible.

In the introduction, the authors stated that their intention was to give people seeking a new home a brief description of the area and the advantages it offers as one of the foremost cities of the South. Throughout the book, they gave detailed accounts of various aspects of the county, including its public and private facilities, advantages and needs, and its relation to the state as a larger whole in terms of its products, climate, government, and people. "," When the handbook begins discussing the people of Durham, it mentions the negro population, and states that it was largely descended from former slaves, but the importation of those forced laborers was very rare at the beginning of the 18th century onwards. The authors then attributed the large number of blacks in the area to natural causes such as a healthy climate, a humane public system, and the kindly tempers of the owner They stated that African Americans were happy to stay within the state because of the affection shown to them by their previous masters. Since slaves' emancipation, the book claimed African Americans have been shown absolute equal rights, with the exception of the slightly larger poll-tax and property tax, which the writers attributed to their population within the state, not their particular race. When discussing suffrage later in the hand-book, the authors explained why African Americans are withheld from administering to the law themselves as magistrates. It is because, explained the authors, blacks have just been released from slavery and are therefore ignorant of the duties of citizenship. This, the authors claimed, is for everyone's safety, including the colored man. "," This extract is a commentary on the county of Durham that reveals a great deal about their identity. The Educator Company explains current race relations and demographics with a history of the treatment of African Americans, and claims that Durham is a harmonious community now because it has always been so, even in the times of slavery. This belief, as well as the reasoning behind the disenfranchisement of African American's rights, is representative of many other counties' and states' racial ideologies in the South at the turn of the 19th century. "," At this point in time, several southern states were passing laws or constitutional amendments depriving black citizens of their right to vote, or at least making it very difficult to do so. Jim Crow laws were also very popular, and North Carolina was on the brink of adopting the separate but equal statute following the Plessy v. Ferguson trial. Finally, a ruthless white-supremacy campaign launched in 1898 completed a decade of setbacks for African Americans living in North Carolina. This second-class citizenship was adopted by local, state, and national legislatures, and indeed, the vast majority of Americans. However, despite these obstacles, the black community still focused on improving their condition and bettering their community. Contrasting to the Educator Company's opinion of the political ignorance of African Americans, many of them became involved with and supported the newly formed Fusion political party, a combination of Populists and Republicans."],"display_date":"1895 - 1896","search_date":"1896-01-01","locations":[{"id":9427,"lat":36.0420245844,"lng":-78.889350822,"zoom":10,"place":"DURHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2776,"title":"Black Prisoners Taken and Killed\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-28","end_date":"1889-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Authorities in Barnwell, South Carolina had arrested and jailed a group of black men, accusing them of the murder of a pair of white men in the area. As the eight suspects sat in their jail cells one night in late December 1889, a group of masked men entered and forcefully removed them from the jail. The masked men took the accused and slaughtered each and every one of them. While the law enforcement had not yet decided whether to take action or not, blacks in the community felt the incident was critical enough to call a town meeting. They intended to discuss plans of a mass emigration from the South Carolina county in order to avoid further racial intimidation and discrimination.","At the end of the nineteenth century, race relations worsened as racial violence replaced efforts to harmonize blacks and whites in the South.

This was especially prevalent in areas that had weak law enforcement, such as rural places like Barnwell. White citizens had to protect themselves, especially against a group they considered so dangerous.","Yet law enforcement played a larger role in lynching than believed by historians. It was not the lack of authority that allowed lynchings to occur. Rather, it was their neglect to take preventative measures. Most private mob lynchings, such as this one, actually got their victims from the law enforcement itself. In fact, over 80 percent of those lynched had previously been in police custody. Therefore, it was not extraordinarily unusual for a group of men to enter the jail and remove its inhabitants without question.

H. Arnold of Walton County, Georgia placed an announcement in the Athens Southern Banner offering a 50 reward to anyone who found his runaway slave. In most ways this ad was like any other runaway slave reward announcements. It reflected the basic ideology of slavery that the slave was property that rightfully belonged to its owner and should be returned if found.  In this particular ad, though, Arnold also recognized less visible characteristics of race relations in the antebellum South. In his announcement, Arnold speculated that the runaway was decoyed away by a white person and that he may obtain a free pass and leave the country.  ","What type of white person in Georgia in 1842 would have encouraged a slave to run away? Was this white person that Arnold suspects trying to take the slave for his or her own good or trying to help the slave escape?  Though we cannot determine what is the most likely answer to these questions for Arnold's case specifically, the possible answers demonstrate the complexity of race relations in the South from the onset of the Slave Trade in the South up to the Civil War.  ","It is plausible that Arnold feared that a slave trader kidnapped his slave to sell him somewhere else.  The slave trading business was an extensive system and we know that traders and bandits kidnapped slaves and free-blacks in order to sell them.  It also would have been logical for Arnold to fear abolitionist involvement in his slave's escape.  Part of the work of abolitionist groups in the antebellum North was to help blacks fleeing slavery to get safely to the North.  Though very secret at the time, we are now aware of an extensive system referred to as the Underground Railroad that was in place to assist runaway slaves.  Blacks and whites worked together to make the Underground Railroad function.  Whatever Arnold specifically feared about possible involvement in the disappearance of his slave, his fear is evidence that the white people interfered with the institution of slavery as well as upheld it.

Democrats instituted a system of disenfranchisement, by requiring each person to vote in the township in which he resided and by allowing voters to be challenged at the polls. Additionally, Democrats attacked Governor Holden and threatened to impeach him and then dispose of him once the Democrats gain political power.

Kempin, upset over the discriminatory policy, had an altercation with Simmons' brother and then angrily left the establishment. Later he returned with a group of fellow soldiers and continued the heated argument, creating a violent scene. As the altercation grew more out of control, Simmons shot Kempin in defense of his brother. It was unclear whether the wound was fatal, but Simmons was still arrested by authorities. Word finally reached back to Kempin's camp, and on November 29, a rumor spread through the city that the regiment was planning to escape the encampment in order to riot in retaliation for their fellow soldier's assumed death.","At first glance, this was just another story about how the reaction to segregation became deadly and the divided system did not serve as a resolution to the racial violence and struggles facing the South. Only two years before, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson, legalizing separate facilities for the races. This justified Simmons' refusal to serve Kempin, and to defend that right, yet not to the extent of murder. These altercations over segregation occurred over restaurants, railroads, and restrooms, among other locations. ","What set this story apart was the response to Kempin's murder. Whites paid little attention to Kempin's actual fate, but concerned themselves greatly over the soldiers' response to his death. The thought that a large group of black men would wreak havoc upon the city worried many of the citizens as evidenced by the paper printing a story about the potential riot. This imagined situation mirrored the whites' fear of slave revolts of the earlier part of the century. Because segregation prolonged the racist views of slavery, the idea of a violent uprising was still a great fear-especially since these were trained military men.

Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize. He was lambasted by the Cleveland Gazette, which called his defense of the monstrous franchise provision...a disgrace to the race and to our civilization, and wished he had never been born. For all of their objections, however, Mississippi, and the rest of the South, as many other states followed suit, plunged itself headfirst into a half-century of legal disenfranchisement and discrimination.

Crime increased during this period which in turn caused people's responses to crime to grow more severe. Lynching became a popular way for whites to threaten and maintain justice over black suspects and criminals. Rural areas with little law enforcement, and areas with transient populations, were subjected to the most lynchings in the South. Georgia housed both of these types of places, where there was an average of ten lynchings per year.","This lynching was just one of the many rape-inspired attacks that occurred in the South. Over 60 percent of the lynchings of black men corresponded to an alleged sexual assault against a white woman. A third of those also involved mutilation and castration of the offender. The pretense for this common occurrence was the need to preserve the honor of whites. The code of honor in the South was heavily adhered to by white men at the time. This involved carrying out the duty to protect and uphold the honor of the women of their race and defending against black men who would denigrate that dignity. Any relations between a black man and a white woman were seen as immoral and a threat to white male dominance in the area. White men viewed the relations as the blacks' infiltration into white's territory and property and took whatever means necessary to protect it.

On vacation she went to Mobile, Alabama where she met up with her friend Edith Whitfield. Whitfield lived on the plantation of her father, General Nathan Whitfield. In writing about her experience, Bryan described the nearly 900 slaves on the plantation. In her observations, Bryan decided that the slaves were all happy and polite on the elaborate plantation with everything one could possibly desire. ","The description Bryan provided is emblematic of the overall belief in the South that slavery was the best thing for black people. In fact, many went so far as to say that enslaved people enjoyed and depended on slavery. Slavery was a relationship between masters and slaves and both parties benefited. Slaves received guidance while masters received happy and loyal workers. While Bryan was not the owner of 900 slaves, she believed as the Whitfields did that the slaves were better off with masters providing for them than on their own. Masters were patriarchs who protected their slaves who were simply inferior from birth. Bryan chose not elaborate too heavily on the condition of the slaves, but rather dismissed their happiness as normal. The Sambo stereotype of enslaved people implied that slaves were happy and good-natured in addition to lazy and ignorant. Bryan's observations fell inline with traditional southern views of blacks and therefore did not require any further explanation. ","In the minds of many slave holders, slaves were simply a part of white families and a responsibility for masters. An observation on the happiness of the slaves reflected more on the strength and character of the masters than the slaves themselves. Slaves were a symbol of status throughout the Deep South; the more slaves someone had, the more respected they were. Masters were not just judged solely on the quantity of slaves; a good master ensured that the slaves were productive and happy. While Bryan's casual observation initially seems trivial, she portrayed the traditional stereotype of enslaved people throughout the South. She also commented on the strength and character of her friends the Whitfields. Based on her description of numerous, happy slaves, one can assume that the Whitfields were of high status in Mobile, Alabama.

Little did the surrounding area know that they would be celebrating throughout their entire journey-in a destructive and fatal way. On March 8, 1899, the black men of the Tenth Immunes boarded their train with hidden firearms in tow. As the train started along, and began coming along stations, the men fired multitudes of shots out of the windows at each platform. The shootings became more wild and unpredictable as the soldiers got more and more intoxicated. Evidently they concealed more than just guns as they boarded the railway car. By the time they had left the Macon area, one sixteen-year-old boy's life had been claimed by the soldiers. The commotion reached its heights after it passed into the outskirts of Macon, where the mayor and the Governor had to call upon the militia and armed citizens in order to maintain peace and retaliate as the train passed into Griffin, Georgia. ","It seemed unreasonable for a group of men to go on a shooting rampage from their railcar undisturbed when people knew that they were the source. But railroads were among the first places in which segregation was accepted and implemented. Therefore, the soldiers were in a car to themselves. They were also in a second-class car, where smoking and spitting and other related activities were permitted. Therefore it was not seen as a problem when the men pulled out alcohol and started drinking, or brought out their firearms. It was not seen as extremely out of the ordinary.","The situation was perpetuated further by the soldiers' consumption of alcohol. The temperance movement was in full swing by this time, with many of the prominent organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance League, making their way into Georgia in the 1880s. In an effort to gain new supporters for the cause, this occurrence would have served as a headline story about the evils prompted by liquor. It had been consumed in public, caused political disruption, and killed an innocent boy. The real selling point of the incident was that blacks were the ones under the influence. The movement used blacks as a way to gain support, claiming that alcohol would make blacks, especially men, a greater danger than they were already assumed to be.

In an article in the Montgomery Advertiser the following Tuesday, the woman was excused from her decision to sit in a seat exactly suited to her mind with the dismissal that she knew no better, and probably had been told that she was as good as the whites, and entitled to as many privileges.

In recounting her story, Louisa Picquet discussed the races of slaves on several occasions. As a slave, Louisa recognized differences between herself and other slaves. She described herself as relatively white, but that other slaves around her where more white than she. She also noticed a difference in the way masters treated their perfectly white slaves and their jet black slaves. Masters preferred their slaves to be more white than black, though no matter how white a slave was, it was not good enough. For example, Louisa described her mother as pretty white; not white enough for white people. ","After describing race in Mobile from her perspective, Louisa described a particular situation on a plantation where her friend worked. A white and black slave both served as waitmen for their master. The master preferred the white slave and the black slave was jealous and plotted against him. He told his master that the white waitman had sexual relations with the almost-white female slave the master kept for his own. The jet black slave knew this was the only thing for which his master would beat the white slave. His assumptions were correct, and the white slave was heavily beaten and sold. The black slave knew that the only way he could gain favor was to charge the white waitman with a crime the master could not ignore. ","As Africans were shipped to the United States in greater numbers, race could no longer be simply white or black. Relationships between white masters and female slaves, or even in rare cases black freemen and white women, produced racial complexity. In fact, in Virginia there were as many as 61 different ways to describe skin tones. No matter how white a person appeared, if they had any African ancestors, they could be enslaved. However, the whiter a slave was, the more desirable they were to their masters. In the case Louisa described, this was true for both male and female slaves. In the female case, masters preferred whiter slaves for their own desires. With men, masters simply preferred keeping whiter slaves closer to them. This is a theme throughout the South as law makers and community members continually had to define what it meant to be white or black in a land where very few people could be definitively defined as one or the other."],"display_date":1861,"search_date":"1861-07-02","locations":[{"id":285,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2853,"title":"The Constant Threat of Disease\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-08-08","end_date":"1865-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 8, 1865, the Montgomery Advertiser warned its readers to look out for cholera.

The petitioners wanted a commutation of the sentence of the black man Preston Harris, who was sentenced to be hung for arson. Harris sent fire to the jail where he was housed, though no one seemed to know if it was accidental or purposeful. All of the prisoners housed in the jail were brought out to safety, and the conflagration was put out before too much damage was done. The court ruled that for this offense, Harris should be hung. The petition requested that the sentence be changed from hanging to life imprisonment since the prisoner was only 17 years old. It was obviously a clear case of guilt, but many people felt that it was too harsh for such a young man, even if he was black. "," There are many examples in Southern history of whites (and blacks as well) petitioning for blacks to be granted mercy in regards to very harsh sentences in the Virginia penal system. Historically, petitions were an important part of the American legal system, and citizens actively used this right to redress grievances and plead for mercy, especially with regards to criminals. This collective action allowed the general population to have a say in the specific roles of their government. However, it is not typical for whites to take such specific action for a black man. It was not unknown however, as can be seen throughout Virginia history. For example, in the case of Angela Barnett in 1793, Angela appealed to have her death sentence pardoned since she was with child. With this appeal and the help of petitions from white friends, that sentence was pardoned. While whites may find blacks dangerous as a whole, individual blacks were their friends. In this way, whites saw Harris as an individual person, who was unjustly sentenced, not as a part of the threatening black masses. While the specifics of the case are unknown, it is clear that whites in Southside Virginia saw the injustice of such a harsh sentence for someone so young.

When the Civil War broke, this was exacerbated by the fear that slaves would join the Union army. Louis Hughes was a slave from Mississippi. As the war progressed, Union armies came closer and closer to his hometown until ultimately they came through and destroyed Panola. Masters feared for their lives and their property and decided to send some of their slaves further south and away from the Yankees. Hughes and his wife were part of a group initially sent to Georgia. Once in Atlanta, Hughes and his wife were transferred again, this time to Mobile, Alabama. In Mobile, Hughes was sent to the salt works.

Salt was essential for preserving meat, and thus Hughes and his wife were forced to play a critical role in aiding the southern military effort. ","In 1863, it became legal for the Union army to use black troops. While this included freed blacks, Northern troops also enlisted runaways who offered their service. For blacks, this was a way of guaranteeing freedom and showing patriotism. Clearly southerners feared this. They accused Lincoln of inciting slave rebellions and violating laws of war.

The lynchers, according to the newspaper, would never be prosecuted. On March 27 of the previous year, the same newspaper reported that levee cutters would be properly cared for by the citizens of Bolivar county, as ropes and trees are plentiful up there. Thus it seems that lynching, for American Southerners, was simply an every-day fact of life; according to the Cleveland Gazette, the man in lynched in Texas was just one of 235 that year. Judging by later statistics, a proportionally large amount of those most likely occurred in Mississippi. ","Many if not all of those 235 lynching victims in 1891 were blacks, as African Americans were often the targets of lynch mobs . As the first blurb points out, it was common for whites of the South (and indirectly, by their indifference, the North) to simply let mob justice take its course, in order to, according to Michael Pfeifer, supposedly serve the purposes of local elites and other whites in relieving both economic and sexual anxieties. As white men saw it, the most overt kinds of opposition to their supremacy were frequently represented in these two forms. (Later, according to the Cleveland Gazette, white women of the south would take the take the charge in putting a stop to this mentality and to lynching). Thus the tensions in the South leading to lynchings were deeper simply skin color, although, according to Philip Dray, it was because of skin color that the accusations against those being sought out for lynching were often amplified and exaggerated by individuals in order to incite mobs.","During the late 1800s, according to Johnathan Markovitz, lynchings were carefully designed to convey to black persons in this country that they had no power and nothing else whites were obligated to respect. They were, in other words, used as measures of intimidation in order to prolong a society of white supremacy. Often, mobs of whites would turn lynchings into violent public spectacles, punishing one or two blacks to supposedly, as put by a Mayor of New Orleans, cause the others [to] trouble you no more.","Not all whites supported lynch mobs, however. Governor Hogg certainly did not appreciate the Law of the Mob. As Pfeifer points out, many others, such as Andrew Augustus Gunby, spoke out against lynchings and in support of law and order. They did so, however, often at the risk of their jobs and reputations, as Gunby blamed his stance on the lynching matter for his loss in the Democratic nomination for Congress from Louisiana's Fifth District in 1886. Additionally, Gunby, as many anti-lynching whites most likely did, spoke out in support of white supremacy; it is not as if he was anti-lynching because he believed in the equality of black men and women, he simply wanted the law to be upheld.","This is not the entire story of lynching in the South, however, as it seems things had changed by 1899. The Clarion Ledger, on September 14 and 21 of that year, published articles supporting the decision of the Governor McLaurin to call out the militia for the purpose of detering a lynch mob (an the militia followed his order), and lamenting the lynching of an innocent black man in Lawrence County, thus pointing out the wrongs of lynching. Although the paper still (somewhat paradoxically) supported lynching for rape, the evil [must] stop here. This seems to be, and is in a small way, a complete moral reversal of earlier values espoused by the paper (and supposedly therefore the average Mississippian). Unfortunately, there were some alternate motives.","Interestingly (and horribly) enough, economics played a large part in leading white supremacists to turn away from using lynching as a tool; according to Pfeifer, in the first decades of the twentieth century, an emerging urban bourgeoisie [in the South] wary of public disorder and threats to the accumulation of capital pressed for systematic legal methods for the sustenance of white supremacy. It seemed that by the early 1900s (and according to the Ledger, as early as 1899), the efforts of anti-lynching thinkers such as W.E.B. du Bois and Ida B. Wells, an African American woman who encouraged blacks to boycott, vote, and agitate against white oppressors were causing people everywhere to pay attention to what was happening in the South. Later, as Markovitz points out, efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (founded 1909) were paying off in bringing unwanted publicity to lynchings in the South, thereby threatening business by scaring off investors; influential white businessmen began to push more and more for writing white supremacy into law in order to legitimize the systems of white supremacy as well as maintain the flow of investments into the South. ","This is not to say that lynching stopped, however. The Cleveland Gazette reported episodes of lynchings in Mississippi into the 1920s. Furthermore, it seems white supremacy itself did not bother the aforementioned investors. Many across the country simply wanted to turn a blind eye to ways in which the system was being enforced. It's even questionable as to whether or not whites across the country objected to lynching as a process, as legal lynchings became popular in the early 1900s as a somehow more just and orderly answer to pure mob violence. Thus, it seems the September Ledger issues were merely protesting the evil of mob justice."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - December 31, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-03","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2873,"title":"Governor Mahone&#39;s Views on the Riot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-11-03","end_date":"1883-11-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On November 3, 1883, a black man refused to move off the sidewalk for a white man, and the ensuing violence caused a riot throughout the city of Danville as whites and blacks were attacked each other.

Its repercussions sent shockwaves through the state of Virginia, especially with the November elections so close at hand. In response to the Danville riot, Governor William Mahone sent out a public statement on his views of the Danville riot. Mahone blamed the bourbon managers (referring to the bourbon democrats) for provoking the collision. He claimed the violence was done to intimidate black people and hurt the cause of his Readjuster Party. He explained how United States troops had been requested since the state militia was so biased against blacks in dealing with the violence. The statement was clearly political, as he blamed his political enemies for the violence. "," The late nineteenth century was plagued with political upheaval, especially in the South, as Southerners searched for a postbellum identity. The Readjuster Party was a third party that had an important influence in Virginia politics. The party gave substantial power to blacks and was based on equality for all. The party wanted to lift the state debt and therefore cut many civil service programs. It rejected the radicalism of both the Republicans and the Bourbon Democrats, who were an extreme wing of the Democrat that resisted the compromises that the Democrats were trying to make. With the November elections approaching, the violence in Danville was the result of frustration on the part of whites because of the increase political mobilization and power of blacks. The failure of a black man to show respect to a white man was the catalyst, and the violence caused the situation to spin out of control. This reaction of violence to the perceived arrogance of negroes was typical throughout the South, as the practice of lynching indicates. It also reflected an intense sense of honor that was prevalent throughout the South. Through violence, whites kept blacks in their place and protected a sense of order. Blacks were given little opportunity to express their grievances, since the law was so often on the side of whites.

The cuts were not deep and Davis was not seriously injured. The black man escaped by running down the railroad tracks and away from Davis and other townspeople. Mr. Davis had no idea who the man was or what had provoked him to such a violent act. "," However, the next day the young son of George Burton was with a black man named Frederick Claytor. They decided to go tramping together, but Burton was appalled by the black man's behavior and reprimanded him for his repulsive acts. Heated words were exchanged and the Claytor pulled out a pistol and shot Burton in the shoulder. Claytor was arrested in Chesterfield County and was taken for examination to Justice Perkins. It was suspected that Claytor was the same man who had assaulted Mr. Davis, but Mr. Davis failed to show up at the jail to identify him. "," The judge's verdict in this case is unknown, but this case was important because it showed the fear that white's had towards blacks and the violence that some blacks showed to whites in retaliation for their inferior status in Southern society. Violence was a tool that whites used to establish the status quo and order within Southern society. However, when violence was used by blacks against whites, that social order was disrupted. As can be seen in this episode, black violence was portrayed as irrational and unpredictable. White anger was excusable, but black anger was disturbing and unjust. In many ways, this episode reflected the inferiority of blacks that many whites believed was inherent. While Claytor was a tramp, Burton only engaged in tramp-like activities.

As the white administrators of the Paris Mountain Water Company drafted new rules of their newly acquired waterworks, they established regulations to prevent or oppress most African Americans in their struggle for survival in the post-Reconstruction era southern United States. For example, as a newly reunited extended family set up sharecropping efforts near each other; naturally, the familial unit was tempted to use the same water service to promote the health and overall welfare of the group. However, as the white power-holders discovered any shared service, the water would be cut off and the amount paid for the service would not be returned. Then, the freed African Americans were stranded with no running water, creating further obstacles against their future success as freed men. "," As Emancipation gave freedom to the African-American population across the South, the Paris Mountain Water Company in a district of Greenville of the same name instituted indirectly oppressing rules on the use of water on November 1, 1899. According to Edward Ayers, areas across the South took pride in their new water works and functioning sewers. As modernization and technological advances made indoor plumbing possible, the white southerners in control of the waterworks industry used their position of power to prevent these health-promoting developments from benefiting those who could not manage to acquire them; furthermore, as the forced division of slave families were sometimes repaired in the years of the 1880s and 1890s, families, whether of blood or not, were formed as support systems in response to oppressive rules and regulations of the post-Bellum South, according to Wilbert Jenkins. "," Beneath the tensions crossing race lines in different utility regulations lies the perseverant tatters of slavery as the whites struggled to keep the increasing African-American population in check; therefore, while the water regulations indirectly limited the African-American populations of Paris Mountain in Greenville and limited their access to health promoting indoor plumbing, it also indicates the pattern of oppression that persists up until the 20th century.

The men included prominent clergymen, lawyers, bankers, and merchants of the city. They proceeded to march into the Negro Quarters to seize A.L. Manly's, editor of the Daily Record, printing office. They invaded the building, destroyed fixtures, and overturned kerosene lamps, starting a fire that spread and consumed the top floors. The news of the white mob quickly reached a cotton compress where approximately 300-400 African Americans were at work. These men immediately halted their work and went to the streets, creating mass chaos. It is unclear how trouble started but the whites opened fire on some African Americans on a street corner, killing three of them. Following that, the white men followed several other black men to their houses, dragging them into the streets, killing some and arresting others. By late afternoon, the twenty-five man committee marched to the City Hall and overturned the incumbent government, placing power entirely in the hands of the white Democratic Party. At the end of the day, white guards patrolled every street corner.","The tragic events of the day evolved out of the determination of white voters and taxpayers to take control of the city and county governments. The white Democrats had explicitly stated that they planned to manipulate the ballot boxes and enforce the resignation of the Republican Party from office and the removal of the republican county ticket, whether peacefully or by revolution if necessary. The day following the election, white citizens met under the leadership of Alfred Waddell and decided to take control of the entire city government, adopting resolutions that forced the Mayor and Chief of Police to resign and expelling A.L. Manly from Wilmington within twenty four hours. Manly had published an article in August denouncing white women in response to a speech given the previous year by a prominent Georgian woman where she condemned black men as white women's greatest danger. Manly's editorial rapidly became both a rallying point for white supremacists and a source of shame for African Americans. The committee had sent the orders of the resolution to prominent black leaders within the community and the directions told them to respond to Mr. Waddell by seven-thirty in the morning as to whether they would acquiesce with the removal of the printing press. Unfortunately, it was later discovered that they had mailed the response to Mr. Waddell in a letter that did reach the committee until three hours later than the designated time. In that letter, they had agreed to remove the press and expel Manly from the community, in addition to condemning his article.","In his study, David Cecelski agreed with other historians that Manly played a vital role in the Democratic and white supremacist victories in the election of 1898. Although, Cecelski concluded that Manly's article provided an excuse for the inevitable. In the wake of the growing black power, particularly in Wilmington, the Democrat machine had been advocating white supremacy and scheming to restore their political dominance for years. As neither the state nor the federal government stopped the rioting, the Wilmington Race Riot is the only successful violent overthrow of a local government in United States history. The newly elected Democrats immediately passed the first Jim Crow laws in North Carolina's history, reversing many of the rights that blacks had acquired since the Civil War. Following their election, 454 men signed a White Declaration of Independence stating that the framers of the Constitution never envisioned a franchised black population and declared that they would never again be ruled by African Americans."],"display_date":"November 10, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-10","locations":[{"id":9661,"lat":34.2953764793,"lng":-77.7420682293,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW HANOVER, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2881,"title":"George Henry White is Nominated for Republican Party Congressman \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-05-13","end_date":"1896-05-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 13, 1896, the Republican Party of the Second Congressional District nominated George Henry White, a black native of New Bern, North Carolina, for their delegate to Congress. He showed a masterful display of personal strength as he denied his brother-in-law, Henry Cheatham's, bid for a fifth straight nomination. John Fields had appointed a credentials committee that favored Cheatham, just as he had done in 1894, although this time Fields would not actually serve on the committee but rather was the chairman. White came from behind to prevent the Field's second attempt to fix the credentials process in favor of Cheatham. The convention lasted until around one o'clock in the morning when delegates overwhelmingly nominated White as their choice. Although White would face an experienced incumbent Democrat in the fall, the spring of 1896 Republican convention was the first one since 1890 to exhibit Republican unity.","White had gained the respect that put him in the position to be elected because of his dedicated service as the Solicitor since 1886. He was elected to the United States Congress in the elections of 1896 over incumbent Frederick A. Woodard and was again elected by the Second District in 1898. Although the Republican Party increasingly garnered a label as the black party and Democrats charged white Republicans as traitors to their race, White quickly became almost as popular in his party outside the state as he was at home in North Carolina. After the disputed 1894 elections, the state enacted changes which guaranteed the protection of minority voters and produced a voter turnout of more than 85% of all eligible voters in North Carolina, including an estimated 87% of black voters. In total, there was an estimated 330,000 votes cast, a 20% increase from the 1892 elections and the Republicans and Populists carried the state in all but one congressional district. Unfortunately, this trend would not hold in North Carolina and throughout the South.","White's nomination and later election to Congress was significant as it occurred in the face of a growing movement toward the disfranchisement of blacks. He was the last black Congressman elected in the South but chose against seeking a third term in the elections of 1900 as the North Carolina Democrats changed the laws, intimidating blacks from voting. After White, there were no African Americans elected to Congress for the next 28 years. Beginning in 1890, southern states invoked literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and white primaries to prevent many blacks from voting. Lynching and race riots also began to occur more frequently. In addition, in March 1891, the General Assembly decided to drastically redesign the North Carolina Second District, removing three black-majority counties, Jones, Vance, and Craven, from the Second District and redistributing them to areas dominated by the white Democrats. This forced White, a native of Craven County, to move to Edgecombe where he could once again run as a delegate for the Second District, the only district where he would have a chance of defeating a Democrat. Benjamin Justesen argued that in the face of this growing movement, the North Carolina elections of 1896 were significant because many considered them to be the state's fairest election since Reconstruction."],"display_date":"May 13, 1896","search_date":"1896-05-13","locations":[{"id":9436,"lat":35.9129129092,"lng":-77.5970968689,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2889,"title":"Armed Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-06-01","end_date":"1862-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Armed and prepared for confrontation, runaway slaves knew that their link to freedom was right before their eyes.It was the perfect opportunity to leave the plantation when the Union forces arrived in New Orleans. Many of their masters were away at war and the women were the only ones that stood in the way of freedom. In a period of three months in 1862, large groups of slaves armed with cane knives, clubs, and old guns stole horses and mules and marched to the city. There they bypassed rebel pickets and fought battles with policemen. The fortunate ones eluded capture and found refuge in Union army camps, others were beaten or sentenced to three months hard labor.","Throughout the war, many slaves followed Union armies. In June 1862, one enraged plantation owner finally gave up and ordered all of his slaves off the plantation telling them to go to the devil, instead they went to the Union army. During the early period of the war, black men, served not only in the Union but served many private soldies in the Confederate army. These soldiers carried their servants around with them in the field. Duties for these men included waiting on their masters, cleaning their horses, and cooking their meals. Rations and money became scarce as the war went on and these servants were ordered back to the plantations.","In the summer of 1862, 10,000 refugee slaves were put to work in the Union army cutting wood, policing army camps, and loading and unloading quartermaster supplies. One Union officer reported that many of the fugitives came to the camps starved, having eaten nothing for days. Refugees from all over escaped to New Orleans and were placed in shelters with some rations provided. Many of the black men were ignorant to proper sanitation and health care. On March 17, 1864, the military mayor reported that the colored population was generating disease by living in crowded, unsuitable huts and disregarded the laws of health. The Union officers and General Banks took whatever measures were available to compensate for the large numbers of starving, unemployed, and penniless African Americans in New Orleans.","Although these African Americans filled many positions in the army, they were not permitted to fight alongside their white male counterparts. In August 1862, General Butler decided to enlist free black men into his army to gather more troops. Despite the fact the many African Americans were willing to sacrifice their lives in the army, white people still believed that they would not survive without the paternalistic guidance of their owners.

Taxable property included land, houses, stock, inventory, modes of transportation, entertainers, and luxury items, but the list also included various classes of people. White men, free black men and women, and enslaved men and women that [exercised] the privileges of free persons of color were taxed. Slaveholders paid taxes on their slaves as well. Higher taxes were levied on the more valuable slave demographics, especially men between the ages of sixteen and sixty. Free black men of the same working-age demographic had the highest tax of any of these groups. ","Notably, the two to four dollar tax on white men was listed as commutation for patrol and road and street duties, but no explanation was given for the levies on other populations. Taxes on slaveholdings resulted from their being legally considered property and taxed as such, analogous to the taxation of stock, inventory, horses and wagons also listed in the ordinance. The slave demographics were specified because age and gender affected a slave's economic value. ","Milledgeville taxation was a standard practice, and the 1843 levies increased because of an economic depression between 1841 and 1843. The taxation of free blacks, however, suggests that taxation was not solely for the purpose of funding municipal activities. Free blacks were not 'property,' and in Milledgeville they did not have to pay as many duties as white men, perhaps because they were not considered privy to the same civic securities. Instead, these taxes served a regulatory function; sometimes as high as sixteen dollars, the city's government hoped that even one or two taxes, if high enough, would force or persuade the free black population to leave the city. An additional fifty dollar tax was levied on free African Americans bold enough to move into the city. In spite of these efforts, Milledgeville remained a popular location for newly freed blacks who sought an alternative to the agricultural plantation work available in the country. ","This 'head tax' was commonly used in the South in order to discourage residency and, ideally, force free blacks to move from the area in question. In some areas of the South, the tax could also result in forced bondage; if taxes were not paid and there was no valuable property to be seized, the county could hire out the offender and force him or her to work off the debt, often for menial wages that resulted in months of involuntary labor. These taxes are only some of the ways in which free blacks were formally or informally discriminated against; between 1810 and 1822, free blacks were not allowed to live in Milledgeville at all, and even in 1843 they were required to present a certificate and bond for good behavior in addition to the tax. Such laws and regulations imply, as their creators intended, that living in the South as an African American involved very little freedom-even outside the legal bondage of slavery."],"display_date":1843,"search_date":"1843-07-02","locations":[{"id":1524,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2894,"title":"Harriet&#39;s Freedom\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-01","end_date":"1857-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Harriet knew that when she turned twenty-seven years old, she was free.

Furthermore, next to each slave's name he wrote descriptions. Not physical descriptions but personality traits. Manigault deemed Jacob smart and intelligent and Plato he thought to be good and trusty; however, his praises stopped with Young John when he described him as lazy and Moses as slow and complaining. Manigault commented on his slaves' characters and personalities, not just their working abilities. He called Bob slow, honest, good. These traits have very little to do with work ethic and mostly with character."," It's not personal, it's business has become a mantra for much of the twentieth-century corporate world. Slave owners in the early nineteenth century, however, did not have the luxury of making that distinction because they were dealing with inherently personal things: humans. Charles Manigault displayed this fascinating balance between humanity and business in many of the records he kept of his plantation, as seen in these records. Slaveholders all had to navigate between the fact that their slaves were human and the fact that they were possessions. Many slaveholders did so by recognizing families and marriages within the plantation, by giving slaves measured freedom during their few days off, and by acknowledging such humanizing characteristics such as temperament and work ethic. Slaveholders did, however, repress this humanity in their slaves. They did so through whippings and constant verbal reminders to their slaves of their enslavement, and very few slaveholders to take familial ties into account when contemplating whether or not to sell a slave. "," This repression of enslaved people's humanity had two purposes. The first purpose was to keep slaves enslaved. By constantly suppressing their humanity and treating them as objects, many slaves learned to act as such, at least towards their masters. This deference and servility most likely made the day to day operations of the plantation far easier. The second purpose of the repression of humanity was for slaveholders' own consciences. Had slaveholders dwelled on the humanity of those people whom they were forcibly enslaving, slavery would not have continued. Instead slaveholders reduced their slaves to only partly human, seeing them as children they had to care for not humans they were enslaving. "," This paradox of understanding slaves' humanity as well as treating them as possessions applied to every slaveholder as well as to many non slaveholders who upheld this system of slavery and paternalism.

Because of rampant childhood diseases and absence of many other options of sustenance for infants, breastmilk played a vitally important role in the development of society and families. Many slaveholding women designated enslaved women to be wet nurses for the newly born white children. As Robert Mallard describes in his memoir, As a babe, I drew a part at least of my nourishment from the generous breasts of a colored foster mother. Growing up on a plantation in Georgia, Mallard was certainly one of many young children who were cared for primarily by slaves instead of his own parents. "," This use of enslaved women as wet nurses caused a great deal of debate among Southerners. Many slave holding women did not even see nursing their children as part of their normal responsibilities as mothers. Other women however did look upon this practice with a skeptical and critical eye. In one woman's judgment, 'that woman is but half a mother who does not suckle her own children'","Many southerners were disconcerted by this practice of allowing an enslaved woman to be the primary care taker, however, Mallard felt quite differently. He wrote that his colored foster mother...always held a peculiar place in my regards. A black nurse taught me, it is probable, my first steps and first words, and was as proud of both performances as the happy mother herself. Mallard clearly has an ambiguous relationship with his wet nurse, as he shows by choosing the word peculiar to describe it. Enslaved women acting as wet nurses also had tenuous feelings toward their job as nurse. Most slave women who had children of their own were only allowed one or two months away from their duties before their masters required them to return to work, leaving their children with another slave. Being deprived of time with their own children, enslaved women must have resented time with their slave master's children. In Stephen V. Ash's book A Year in the South: 1865, he describes how Matilda Hughes, an enslaved woman, had to work so much that her twins died because she was unable to breastfeed them often enough. If enslaved women's children died of neglect, how must they have felt when asked to care for other children? But other historians have asserted that often, slave women caring for white children did form strong attachments with these children. This contradiction between motherhood and slavery lies at the heart of Mallard's narrative, and, though Mallard might have seen his childhood through rose colored glasses, this ambiguity unsettled the very core of the domestic household in the South."],"display_date":"1830 - 1835","search_date":"1832-12-31","locations":[{"id":1991,"lat":31.6671183532,"lng":-81.1853351386,"zoom":9,"place":"LIBERTY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2906,"title":"Black Police Marshal Uses Club on White Man and Gets Shot \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-09-23","end_date":"1895-09-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 23, 1895, a very large crowd gathered in Marion to watch the circus and ended up getting much more of a performance than they had bargained for.

As Huggins turned to flee, he was grabbed by two other black marshals who had come to Tillman's aid. Tillman again rushed at Huggins and began striking him repeatedly with the club while the other two marshals held him. He was then rushed to the hospital where it is unlikely that he survived as the pistol bullet was still lodged in his body. The marshals placed Huggins in jail where he also received careful surgical attention, although it is also unknown whether or not he survived the encounter.","At the center of this narrative is the continuing problem of race relations following the Civil War and Reconstruction. Incidents such as the one that occurred following the circus were characteristic of the constant clashes, sometimes violent, that occurred between blacks and whites in North Carolina. By 1895, although the blacks had received the freedom and opportunity to achieve certain esteemed jobs within the community, these jobs did not come with the respect from whites that they seemed to infer. North Carolina during the 1890s was a very hostile environment because whites believed that the blacks were trying to take over control of their government. Blacks had gained significant positions in both local and state government in the election of 1894. Authority exercised by any black man over any white man not only reminded the white southerners that they had lost the War and their property, but also that they had to live in an integrated society with these same people.","Huggins and Tillman's encounter reflects the increasing racial violence that occurred beginning in the 1890s in the South. In his book, Christopher Waldrup discussed the significance of boundaries in the nineteenth century southern society. He explained the developments of these boundaries and how they were constructed, contested, and violated as the uneasy relationship between race and law developed in the post-War South. The turn of the century brought race riots, widespread lynching, and killing of blacks throughout North Carolina and the Deep South. These episodes of interracial violence continued to occur throughout the twentieth century."],"display_date":"September 23, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-23","locations":[{"id":11594,"lat":34.220913684,"lng":-79.3699309097,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2908,"title":"Our Father, Who Art in Heaven","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-01-01","end_date":"1826-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Little Robert Anderson stuttered as he sat on the dirt floor of his slave cabin at his grandmother's feet. Over and over again, he painfully tried to recite the Lord's Prayer, but each time he failed. First, he could not remember how it began. After a hint from his grandmother, he ran into trouble with the latter parts. After many long, frustrating hours, his grandmother, with a pained expression on her face, tied Robert up by his hands and whipped his small back, all the while praying that her grandson would be able to memorize his prayer. "," Years later, Anderson recalled this event when writing his memoir. His account demonstrates the high premium some slaves placed on religion, because of the hope it offered. Anderson's grandmother clearly valued her grandson's learning the Lord's Prayer, if she was willing to whip him over it. "," Christianity offered enslaved people hope. The promise of a better life after this helped slaves defend themselves against the psychological horrors of being property. Anderson's grandmother obviously saw the necessity of this hope and was therefore to do whatever it took to give her grandson access to this hope. When Anderson finally did learn his prayer, though the necessity for this sense of hope was lost on such a young boy, he was, as glad as you ever saw a little fellow. After buying his freedom from his master, Anderson became a renowned and respected pastor, so this incident clearly shaped his life. "," This memorization was, in fact, quite disconcerting for slaveholders. Though most slaves in the South could not read, they did know several significant passages from the Bible, including the Lord's Prayer as well as other, not so innocuous (at least in the slaveholders' eyes), verses about freedom, equality, and the poor. By memorizing these verses, enslaved people combined the oral tradition of their African culture with the Christian religion they had been exposed to in America. This combination gave enslaved people hope and a way to constantly remind themselves of this hope.

The couple had just borne an infant, who that night was sleeping soundly, giving the parents a chance to rest undisturbed. The husband awoke to a sharp blow to his head, shot up out of bed, and called out to his wife. Mrs. Travis awoke to see her husband cut down with an axe and quickly shared his fate. The Travis family was the first of many families to meet an untimely end on the night leading into the morning of August 22, 1831. Nat Turner and a horde of other slaves and free blacks led a crusade against whites, which Turner claimed to be divinely inspired and mandated. He led the way with a dulled cutlass that acted as little more than a blunt piece of steal. At one point in the night, Turner was repeatedly unsuccessful in killing a woman with blows from this weapon, and resorted instead to bludgeons from a loosed fencepost. ","Turner soon gained notoriety among whites as a fanatic preacher who had used his tremendous powers of persuasion to garner his following; His confessor noted him as possessing tremendous mental acuity. He described himself being considered prophetic from an early age, destined for great things. These great things resulted to mutilated corpses strewn about Southampton County, chopped to pieces with axes, the tree fences and house top covered with buzzards preying on the carcasses. In total, the cohort murdered 55 that night.","Turner related the events of the night to Thomas R. Gray from his prison cell, as he was wrapped in rags and chains, a defeated man.

In The Commonwealth vs. Nat Turner, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the stated charges of making insurrection, and plotting to take away the lives of divers free white persons, &c. He explained his plea of 'not guilty' on the grounds that he did not feel so. The common belief at the time was that Nat Turner and the rest of the slaves in Southampton County were like spoiled children who, given too much in youth, grew up to think themselves worthy to rule all they saw. This sentiment, reified by the Southampton Insurrection, led to more stringent laws toward both slaves and free blacks across the South.

Rix of Raleigh, NC, eighteen of his slaves were freed from bondage on the condition that they boarded a ship sailing from Norfolk, VA to the west coast of Africa. One of the eighteen took a stand against these terms, and was resold into slavery. The idea for the resettlement of blacks in Africa began as a way for whites to rid themselves of African American presence to counterbalance ever increasing numbers of free blacks living on American soil. The public image that organizations such as the American Colonization Society presented was one of compassion and of Christian values. Soon it became clear that although there were pockets of blacks who looked positively on the idea of colonization, there were a great many others who questioned the professed philanthropy of its [white] promoters. Blacks who did support the movement often did so only when they decided whites would never allow them to claim full and equal citizenship. Many states, including Virginia, had instituted laws forcing freed slaves to exit the state; Furthermore, Georgia had created a system set on deterring blacks from immigrating to their state by giving free blacks the option of a 500 entrance fee or sale into slavery. ","It quickly became clear that Christian benevolence toward a debased and oppressed race was not the driving force for the movement, but rather a deep-seeded White fear of the growing free black population. John Rix's terms of manumission were not unique. The Colored American, a New York City-based African American newspaper, reported seven other conditionally freed slaves that were to join these seventeen on the ship Saluda, bound for Africa. The Norfolk Harbor was a microcosm of a nationally growing trend at this time. From 1820-1830, 1430 blacks boarded ships such as the Saluda bound for Liberia. In 1832 alone, that number rose to 1037-247 of which were manumitted under the condition of emigration. In this Land of the Free, the free people of color across the country were being pressured to leave their native soil. The blacks of Middletown, Connecticut, found themselves asking, Why should we leave this land, so dearly bought by the blood, groans and tears of our fathers?

Thinly-veiled attempts at humane treatment are not enough to conceal the truly vicious nature of slavery. However, Johnson's book focuses mainly on New Orleans in the antebellum period, and this episode took place in Virginia in the midst of the Civil War. This may explain Wyatt's assertiveness - the Emancipation Proclamation had actually gone into affect four days earlier and many slaves pressed for their rights even when resentful masters and slave traders refused to grant them. In fact, in many states in the deeper South, slaves often did not even find out they had been emancipated until after the war ended.

The businesses of the area would often provide services to people regardless of color or previous condition of servitude. However, this norm was altered on July 13, 1895. Robert Holland ventured into a private establishment of James F. Angle in Baltimore and requested service, dinner in particular. He was denied twice on the grounds of his color.

Branding on the hand was particularly important as an effective way of ensuring the failure of any future attempt at escaping bondage. On June 16, 1838, The Colored American reported that the court of Norfolk Borough had removed those odious relics of the barbarous age, the shackles and staples by which the hand of the criminal was fixed and fastened, to receive the impression of the brand. ","Branding runaways had long been a response used in the South. A 1696 South Carolina statute called for different levels of punishment for the repeated offense: First, forty lashes; Second, an R branded on the Right cheek; Third came forty more lashes and the loss of an ear; Fourth for a man was castration and for a woman was an R on the left cheek and the loss of the left ear; Fifth was death or the cord of one of the slave's legs to be cut off above the heel, the severing of the Achilles Tendon. Laws such as these were amended from time to time to better suit the ruling populace. In New York, the mode of execution for heinous offenses (intentionally broadly defined) was decided on a case-by-case basis. Maryland had a very ritualistic punishment for slaves who even committed petty treason or arson: Their right hand was cut off, then they were hanged, then beheaded, quartered, and put on display all across the county. Barbarous punishment for crimes denied slaves' humanity.

F. Wickham put out a notice in the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>of a twenty dollar reward for the return to him of his slave Cyrus. He described Cyrus as a dark mulatto, between 25 and 30 years of age, rather below ordinary height, prominent cheek bones... He also said that Cyrus had a large scar under one of his eyes, and that he owned a new suit of brown cloth... and a striped waistcoat, giving any information that could possibly help a person determine Cyrus's identity (and return him to Wickham). Cyrus was well known in Richmond, as he had lived there his whole life, and was married to a woman (assumedly also a slave) who lived at Mr. Wm. McKim's.

By mentioning Cyrus's intelligence and the possibility of his escape by way of water, Wickham stated one of the possible ways for a slave to escape to freedom in the nineteenth century. If a slave could get to a boat, passage to the north would likely be much quicker than traveling at night by foot. Stowing away on a boat would allow a slave to hide and wait until arrival in the north, which was much more desirable than being in a constant chase with their masters. Due to this, slaveholders needed the support of the masters of the steamboats to check for these runaway slaves, for once the slaves were onto the boats, there was probably little chance of getting them back."],"display_date":"February 3, 1829","search_date":"1829-02-03","locations":[{"id":13913,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2950,"title":"Typhoid As A Slave Killer\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-04-16","end_date":"1850-04-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 16, 1850, a plantation slave died from typhoid fever after having been sick for six weeks. The slave got up after four weeks of bed rest and subsequently entered a delusional state. The plantation's overseer, Hal Sonbeck, sent for the Doct and he cupt it and bled it and blistered it but he cold not rase it anymore. In a letter to the plantation owner, Iveson Lewis Brookes, Hal informed his master of the death, but was also quick to explain that Lily's old ist daughter lived for only eleven days when she caught typhoid, and that there has been a grate many dide in this neighborhood with the same fevor. A neighboring estate had lost two slaves to the illness as well.","Those living in slave quarters were highly vulnerable to infection, which spread easily among slaves with poor hygiene, living in close, unventilated buildings. Flies transmitted the disease from infected fecal matter, which was often disposed of too close to housing structures. Potable water was often unavailable. According to John Vlach, one Mississippi planter described the average slave accommodation as well-calculated to generate disease. The planters were generally aware of this risk; they knew that slave dwellings would ideally be clean, ventilated, and far apart. Slaveholders, however, often deemed the effort to improve living conditions too costly and time consuming to be worthwhile.","Malnutrition, which was standard for many African Americans in the South, was another possible cause of typhoid death in slave populations. An essay written by a Georgia planter-physician, also in Vlach's book, refers to an 1850 typhoid outbreak near Brookes' plantation and during the same year that Sonbeck wrote this letter. The physician claims that slave violence over food caused the highly contagious fever, and when the slaves were given a nourishing diet, the diseased stopped spreading. This outbreak may not have been related to the one in question, but slaves were certainly more susceptible to disease when their immune systems were weakened by malnutrition. ","Other factors may have contributed to the slave's death as well. For instance, plantation owners generally made all medical decisions concerning their slaves and medical expenses, so Brookes' absence during the time of the outbreak may have slowed the process of procuring medical treatment. Slaves also were often denied medical care if the overseers believed they were faking their illness, and exhaustion from being overworked could weaken the immune system. ","Plantation owners and their overseers often had notoriously bad relationships, and Sonbeck's letter suggests a fear that his master would blame him for the death of his slave. He hopes that the other nearby typhoid deaths will exonerate him from blame, and indeed, Sonbeck probably was not at fault. The deceased's slave's status, however, probably did cause his illness and eventually his death. Slaves were more likely to contract such diseases, and were also more likely to die from them."],"display_date":"April 16, 1850","search_date":"1850-04-16","locations":[{"id":1739,"lat":31.9945164675,"lng":-83.7889236929,"zoom":9,"place":"DOOLY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2953,"title":"Chinese Workers Arrive in Iberville Parish, Louisiana","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-10-26","end_date":"1870-10-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Chinese workers were wide-eyed with anticipation when they arrived at Edward Gay's St. Louis plantation in Iberville Parish, Louisiana on October 26, 1870.  The welcome that the workers recruited from California received when they stepped foot on the rich white Gay family's land was far from hospitable.  Moon-Ho Jung's <em>Coolies and Cane</em> frankly describes the scene: Gay's son Andrew, a planter himself, found the Chinese 'the queerest looking creatures he ever saw,' while his daughter 'laughed till she cried when they came stalking off the boat.'  These foreigners were received with a welcome of mocking disdain.  Gay's wife tried to fit the Chinese into her perception of the local racial structure.  She identified the Chinese as a mixture of mulatoe and Indian.  Edward Gay quickly tried to assimilate his new laborers into his plantation culture.  He gave them work clothes and sent them directly to work in the sugarcane fields.  The Chinese were only allowed to wear their Chinese dress on Sundays.  Just like slaves had been treated, these Chinese workers were stripped of their cultural dress the moment they arrived in Louisiana.  Although these were hired laborers, unlike African American slaves, they still faced similar repression in terms of expressing their specific culture traditions.","    Chinese laborers were gathered from California since agricultural labor was so scarce during Reconstruction in the plantation districts of Louisiana.  Many slaves had left the country or the South altogether, trying to shed its memories of bondage; others still just refused to do the same work they had been forced to do only a few years ago.  White workers often refused to take jobs formerly worked by slaves, as they felt such toil to be below them.  Therefore, with a large and continuously growing Chinese population in California, many plantation owners like Edward Gay looked to this other race to supply their need of labor.  As J.R. Tucker states in his article Race Progress in the United States, 75,132 of the 105,465 Chinese living in America in 1880 were located in California.  In addition, over 70,000 of the Chinese living in California were adult males who were prime candidates for the strenuous labor of the Louisiana cane fields.  ","Since labor prospects for post-Civil War Louisiana plantations were insufficient, owners looked to the growing Chinese population of California to assuage their problem.  Once the Chinese arrived in Louisiana, however, they faced prejudiced treatment that lingered from the recent times of slavery.  Racism was still deeply entrenched in many mindsets of the Louisiana Delta, and was reflected onto the unfamiliar Chinese the planters sought to exploit.  In order to rebuild their war-torn land and economy, plantation owners still used tactics and practices similar to those that had shown them such success during the system of slavery."],"display_date":"October 26, 1870","search_date":"1870-10-26","locations":[{"id":5535,"lat":30.2584984466,"lng":-91.3493659627,"zoom":9,"place":"IBERVILLE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2954,"title":"Fifty Dollar Reward for Return of a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-08-05","end_date":"1815-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In August of 1815, George Hay put an add in the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>newspaper offering a fifty dollar reward (plus expenses) for the apprehension and delivery of Manuel, a runaway slave. Hay gave only the name Manuel; either Manuel had no last name, or Hay felt that labeling him as a negro and a slave was sufficient. Hay described Manuel as broad shouldered and well formed, along with giving his height and other physical characteristics, his clothing, and his likely whereabouts (Northamberland, where he had bought Manuel in 1814). He also mentioned a mark on Manuel's head, given according to Hay, by a blow recently given him by one of his fellow servants. "," Hay's last sentence is interesting in two regards. One is that Hay went out of his way to state that the blow was given by a fellow servant. Whether or not this is true (it is entirely possible that Hay himself was responsible for the blow, as the physical abuse of slaves was prevalent), this wording was likely used to avoid a situation where another would find Manuel and take pity on him for being an abused slave. Secondly, he used the word servant to describe Manuel. Richmond (in comparison to other parts of the south) in the early 1800s was not an especially harsh environment for a slave or any African-American. Also, in other texts in the <em>Enquirer </em>this term is used for slave. Thus it is likely that some of the people were not in favor of slavery. By using the word servant as opposed to slave, Hay attempts to avoid bringing up the moral issue of slavery to those people whom he hopes will assist in returning his lost property."," Also interesting is that Hay posted this reward in the <em>Enquirer </em>multiple times (it shows up again on August 9, 12, 23, and 30). Fifty dollars was a substantial sum in 1815, one of the higher rewards offered for a runaway slave, and the fact that Hay would offer that type of reward, as well as continue to buy space in the newspaper to advertise this fact, shows how valuable a slave was for a white person.

These enslaved people were losing one of their most likely chances of gaining their freedom.","Enslaved people often sought manumission, but manumission in the 1830s in Norfolk, VA was tricky business. If freed from slavery, a person was forced to leave the state, in accordance with an 1806 VA state law. The only reprieve from this forced emigration was to get a special dispensation from the state legislature on account of a good record. Many petitions were made, but few granted, especially in the wake of the Nat Turner Rebellion. More often, manumission was made on the condition of emigration to Liberia, a state on the West Coast of Africa established for the purpose of harboring former slaves. For example, when Billy Pugh, a slave owned by the Overseers of the Poor of Norfolk County, was recommended for such a dispensation in December 1832, he was denied; This man had spent thirty years of his life raising several thousand dollars for the poor, and his only reward was the option to leave his home continent for Africa. Only three former slaves were permitted to stay in Virginia during the mid-1930s, all of whom were elderly and had provided significant service to the white population. The economy of Norfolk at this time was inextricably tied with slavery. Most enslaved men were considered semi-skilled or skilled workers, and the women filled scores of domestic positions. The shear numbers of slaves speak to how dependent upon slave labor the county was: In 1830, in a population of 9,814, slaves numbered 3,756, about 38 percent of the population. So with close to forty percent of the population providing free labor, it is clear that Mary James' position as recipient of these human goods was common in this society."],"display_date":"December 20, 1832","search_date":"1832-12-20","locations":[{"id":14195,"lat":36.6743486041,"lng":-75.9181406429,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCESS ANNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2956,"title":"Murder Warrants No Fair Trial\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-09-16","end_date":"1893-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["According to <em>The State</em>, at two in the morning of September 27, Calvin Stewart was lynched.

Gooch wrote a letter in the winter of 1825 on the issue of slaveholding in Virginia and the South. Gooch believed that the subject of slaveholding states rights' was not getting enough attention from southern politicians. Throughout the letter Gooch argued against the intrusive interference of our northern neighbors on that of slaves, saying that they knew nothing of the cultural state of things among us [the South]. He also argued that there is little difference in the state of African-Americans in the north and the south, except that of political rights, which were hardly rights in the north. Slaves had better lives than their poor northern brethren, he stated. Gooch did not defend slavery's virtues in this letter; instead he argued against the north forcing its ways upon the south. He even stated that the southern states themselves are affording a devise gradually to get rid of the evil [slavery], but that they were doing it their way, on their time. At the end of his letter, he focused on the independence of Virginia as a state, and that as such the state has its own rights to run things the way it sees fit, under its own timetable."," In this letter much is seen about the way Virginians thought of the institution of slavery in the first half of the nineteenth century. While slavery in the inner-city of Richmond was not embraced as it was in much of the plantation south, Virginians still defended their right to have it everywhere, and resented the northern states attempting to end it. Gooch's statement that the northerners know nothing of the state of things in the south (and that slaves were better off than their northern counterparts) showed that southerners in Virginia honestly have believed that their institution of slavery was not in fact the evil it was made out to be. At the end of his letter, Gooch's emphasis on Virginia as a state and the rights that it thus had foreshadowed the Civil War that was still over thirty years away. The attitude that the northern states could not tell the southern states what to do, specifically with regard to slavery, would eventually be a key factor in dividing the country and leading to war. This would be very important in Virginia, a border state in the North-South conflict. Here these feelings of state's rights showed up long before anyone could even have imagined an event on the scale of the Civil War taking place.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

School Superintendent Richard A. Dobie filed the report, at the request of Norfolk Mayor C. Brooks Johnston. Though the Report was not intended to make any political or social gestures, analysis of the data entailed, reveals striking inequalities in the social institutions of Norfolk. While the report does not comment on the subjective quality of education, or provide test scores, the report does provide us with records of student absenteeism, teacher salaries, and school population reports. Most evident from analysis of the data is the striking disparity between teacher salaries. According to the report white men make on average 40.71 more than a black man, similarly, while women make less than men of both white and black racial identity, white women earn on average a salary of 55.43 compared to the salary of a black women 45.00. Consequently, lower wages provided a disincentive for quality black teachers to enter the education field. Additional evidence of what appears to be an emerging preference toward white students is the teacher to student ratio found in many of the Norfolk classrooms. Of the sixty-five teachers employed by the Norfolk school district, only eleven of them were African Americans, leaving classrooms overcrowded. Perhaps what best highlights the overcrowding of black schools was the actual number of students enrolled on average in the various white and black schools of Norfolk. The nine public schools which housed the 3343 white students was sizably less crowded than the two black schools that housed the 829 black students enrolled in public school. Additionally the attendance of black students is on average lower than the attendance of white students in the city of Norfolk. While the average attendance rate at the nine white schools hovered between ninety and ninety-five percent, the two black schools witnessed attendance rates of only eighty percent, including Atlantic City School (colored) that had only fifty-four percent student attendance. The findings of the report illustrate the shift from visible outwardly hostile racism witnessed during the Civil War to the more subtle incorporation of institutional racism. Black disenfranchisement and the disproportionate access to government funding of schools was the driving force behind the educational inequity. The most notable danger of this report is the findings were prefaced with no explanation of the policies or spheres of improvement, indicating that inadequacies of the black schools was not an area of concern.

Conway identified the Northern Peabody Education Fund as the root of many problems public Louisiana schools were facing; in particular, Conway cited the Fund as responsible for having created the growing trend of white parents taking their children out of public schools.  Because the Peabody Fund's money explicitly provided assistance for free schools open to both black and white children, Conway could easily trace his problems back to the Fund's policy.  White parents in Louisiana increasingly refused to send their children to public schools that now allowed black children to attend.  Many white parents would rather remove their children from education altogether, or send them to private schools than have them attend classes with former slaves.  Because so many white parents would not allow their children to learn with African Americans, it seemed that African Americans were receiving a greater proportion of educational funding.  Feeling cheated, whites, with Conway leading them, attacked the Peabody Fund.  "," Therefore in December 1870, Dr. Barnas Sears, the general agent and administrator of the Peabody Fund, wrote a letter in response to Conway's complaints.  <em>The Farmer's Cabinet </em>reported on December 29, 1870 that Sears wrote to Conway: 'We [the Peabody Fund] ourselves raise no question about mixed schools.  We simply take the fact that the white children do not attend them without passing on the propriety or impropriety of their course.  We wish to promote universal education - to the whole community if possible.'  Sears was carrying out the mandate that the Peabody Fund had been established upon, that education for <em>all </em>children was the most essential aspect of trying to rebuild the war-torn South.   "," During Reconstruction in the South, black children were finally allowed to attend public schools.  The new Louisiana constitution, written by both white and black elected delegates, not only outlawed segregation in public schools but also required that every parish establish at least one school within its jurisdiction.  As Tunnell includes in his <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>,  a free African American delegate from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, who helped to write the new constitution, believed that these new provisions for education would elevate and enrich a Louisiana which had previously been ridden with both black and white ignorance and illiteracy.  However, in Louisiana, with a large African American population, this created major problems within the school system.  Since racism still afflicted Louisiana and the greater South, white parents often refused to send their children to school with African American children. The years of Reconstruction saw the rise of a great number of private schools across the South, as whites searched for alternatives to sending their children to school with African American children."," The complex tensions found within Southern society during Reconstruction are clearly shown in education.  The Northern money flowing into the devastated South was both needed and resented.  The disruption of the Southern social order as evidenced in changes within its system of education was a source of great conflict and attention during the Reconstruction era."],"display_date":"December 29, 1870","search_date":"1870-12-29","locations":[{"id":5547,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2973,"title":"Mistaken Identity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-14","end_date":"1893-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mrs. M.A. Moore, widowed mother of seven grown children, was alone in her home one morning. As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount's claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent. However, their conclusion did little to sway Andy Blount's ultimate fate."],"display_date":"February 14, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-14","locations":[{"id":12056,"lat":35.2006308637,"lng":-85.2180291091,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2976,"title":"Mr. Vermillion got between me and my freedom, so I killed him.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-10-07","end_date":"1845-10-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The inhumane murder of James T. Vermillion by a runaway slave sparked a manhunt in Fairfax County.  The slave, owned by Mr. William Brawner of Prince William County, had not gotten very far when Mr. Vermillion caught him near his house, Pleasant Valley, in Fairfax County. Upon apprehending the runaway, Mr. Vermillion was going to take him to the magistrate for a proper conviction and return to his master, as in due process. The slave, having had a small taste of freedom, could not bear the thought of returning to slavery, prompting him to murder Mr. Vermillion in an attempt to escape yet again.  As this attempt was successful, the slave became both a runaway and a murderer. Whether the runaway was ever caught is unknown.  If he were, he undoubtedly would have been executed for his crimes.  Slaves had very little voice in the judicial system.  Even if the runaway killed Mr. Vermillion unintentionally the likelihood of his conviction and subsequent execution was very high. ","At the center of this narrative is the psychological damage that slavery had on slaves.  They were stripped down mentally and dehumanized in such a way, that freedom was their only real option to a harrowing real life.  This slave was not the only one who cracked under the constrictions and hardships of slavery, which worked to bolster white supremacy. In his book Soul by Soul, historian Walter Johnson makes the point that slaves were no more than commodities.  The process of dehumanization that took place to turn them into objects rather than people was both mentally and physically destructive.  In addition to this, the disciplining of slaves was rarely punishable in court, regardless of how severe.  Courts were even reluctant to chastise abusive slave owners as long as their behavior did not affect the community. Thus, slaves themselves could not charge their master with abuse; someone else in the community would have to bring the case to court. While this directly shows the how little the law represented it also gives insight into how harmful owners could be to their slaves without punishment.  These things combined provided the slaves with a lifestyle that not all could handle.

In Fluvanna County, a black man named William Holly stole the bacon and other property belonging to a white woman named Beverly Haden. Haden pressed charges for the offense, and the accused stood trial for his crimes, and was found guilty. After emancipation, trials involving free blacks in the South were often conducted carefully to avoid the possibility of being accused of any impropriety due to racial bias. ","When writing the report of the trial proceedings, Captain Frank P. Cranton, Attorney General Manager of that district, made sure to emphasize the complete fairness of the proceedings: The evidence and the prisoner's confession were strongly against him. The examination was fairly constructed. Colored evidence properly taken into consideration and every point of law contested in the prisoner's favor but his legal adviser Thomas H. Tuttwiler, one of the most responsible and best lawyers of the county. The proceedings throughout were conducted with all fairness, and no white citizen could have had a more impartial hearing. ","Often in cases of theft or other relatively minor infractions with recently freed blacks as the defendants a certain amount of condescending leniency was granted. The officers of the court regularly assumed that because of the short time that had passed since the defendant had even become a citizen, they could not be expected to be cognizant of the laws of the land. In her book <em>Dixie After the War</em>, Myrta Lockett Avery writes that The new manners of the blacks were painful, revolting, absurd. The freedman's misbehavior was to be condoned only by pity that accepted his inferiority as excuse. However condescending this attitude was, it may have had some merit, although it could just as easily be argued that even former slaves were aware that stealing was against the law. Either way, it definitely worked in the favor of the free blacks who stood trial.","This obsession with propriety and fairness was belied by the still-racist nature of the courts. In the document, Holly is identified as col'd (or colored), while Haden, a white woman, needed no racial identification at all. In his dissertation, James Douglas Smith writes about the sense of responsibility that whites in Virginia often felt towards freed blacks when it came to helping them navigate through the systems to which they had not been exposed prior to their freedom. Although this is of course not overwhelmingly true, as violence and racial tension comprised a large part of post-Civil War society all over the South, examples of white southerners displaying degrees of kindness, understanding, and paternalistic attitudes towards the newly-freed blacks can be found.

The hanging was in retaliation for the brutal murder of several white individuals around Greensville County, including the 1898 murder of Charles Wyatt, a storeowner from Portsmouth, Virginia. After escaping from jail in Portsmouth, O'Grady and Cotton terrorized Greensville County, executing robberies and the violent murder of a farmer. The duo was eventually captured in Norfolk and was sent to the Emporia jail.Several days later the growing mob of whites and blacks stormed the jail with chants of Lynch [Cotton] Hang [Cotton] String up the man who killed our friends Upon storming the jail, the mob pulled Cotton from his shackles and hanged him from the Cherry tree in the corner of the courthouse yard. After Cotton's lifeless body hung from the tree like a scarecrow blacks who had witnessed the lynching turned on the whites and demanded the subsequent lynching of O'Grady. You have lynched the Negro, now lynch the white man. The biracial crowd then turned on the jail pulling Mr. O'Grady from his cell and hanging him on the Cherry tree next to the lifeless body of Walter Cotton.The violent lynching of a black man for the murder of a successful white businessman such as Charles Wyatt was not uncommon at the end of the nineteenth century. However the lynching of Walter Cotton is one of the rare instances in southern history were the participants of the lynching were of both black and white racial identity. The hanging of the two brutal murders shows a brief glimpse of racial equity among the public opinion of the citizens. While the lynchings were influenced by mob hysteria, and against the efforts of police, the participants nonetheless engaged in a public tribunal that blamed both the white and black men guilt of the crime they had committed. Had the racially mixed crowed not demanded the hanging of Mr. O'Grady, then the events of that day would most likely been perceived as yet another incident of an angry white mob engaging in a racially motivated lynching of a black man. Despite being nearly forty years removed from the fall of slavery, violence towards blacks remained prevalent. Despite the exceptional circumstances under which the lynchings were execute, this event appears to advance a sense of community and commonalities shared in the loss of friends and family at the hands of Brandt O'Grady and Walter Cotton.

All African Americans had to have a written pass issued by the individual's owner or trustee. The office and the conductor both required a copy of it, and if the office was not familiar with the signature, the owner or trustee had to physically present themselves and prove that they had 'lawful control' over the individual.","Although Macon and Western specifically announced that they would enforce this policy, the practice of requiring blacks to have a pass was commonplace even off of the railroad. African Americans traveling without one were often arrested under the presumption that they were runaway slaves, and then bore the burden of proving that they were free or otherwise behaving lawfully.","The apparent purpose of the law was to deter slaves from running away and to catch those that were foolish enough to do so. Very few runaway slaves, however, actually attempted to use the railroads as a mode of transportation. If they did, they had to disguise themselves or successfully forge a pass in order to avoid being caught. Apprehended runaway slaves were severely punished and sometimes killed or sold to planters in the Deep South, where plantation conditions were even worse and escaping was nearly impossible. Because of the difficulties and risks involved, runaway slaves more frequently utilized hiding spaces in wagons, boats, and ships. Much of the traveling was done on foot through unpopulated fields and mountains where the risk of apprehension was lower.","The railroad companies and slaveholders were aware of this, and so it is likely that the real purpose of this policy was to deter free blacks from staying in the South, where their rights were severely limited and their freedom often questioned. Slave catchers were heavily compensated for capturing runaway slaves, and would often apprehend free blacks and even sell them back into slavery for the monetary rewards.

Consciousness turned to darkness, emptiness, and then, it was all over."," Although hangings were a common sentence for serious crimes in the nineteenth century South, this particular scene that occurred in St. James Parish, Louisiana in September 1871 is quite unusual.  As the <em>New York Evangelist</em> reported, the two criminals, sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards shared a surprising similarity: all six of these men were African Americans.  "," Reconstruction in the South is often characterized as a time of strict white repression and violence as whites tried to reckon with the freedom of slaves within their communities.  Especially in Louisiana where many parishes had large African American populations, violence committed by whites against free slaves was paramount.  "," However, this execution complicates the model of white supremacy that was believed to crush and control all African American actions.  This event in St. James Parish, Louisiana reveals an interesting instance that questions the role of African Americans in the maintenance of law and order in the South during Reconstruction.  The names of the African Americans, both the criminals and the law enforcement officials, were not mentioned.  This coupled with the brevity of the article reveals that there was little concern for such an occurrence.  There must have been some interest in this scene, though, or else it would not have even been printed, especially in a New York publication.  Even more interesting is that this event refutes the general view of Reconstruction characterized by brutal white law enforcement.  Whites were usually believed to exercise complete control over African Americans who broke the law.  But, this instance clearly refutes this notion.  That the sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards were all African American is quite significant.  At least in St. James Parish, African Americans were afforded some autonomy in punishing criminals of their own race.  With a hierarchy that consisted entirely of African American officials, it can be concluded that not all Southern communities had solely white-dominated structures within the realm of law enforcement."," One explanation for this remarkable set-up of law officials can be found in Ted Tunnell's <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>.  New Orleans, the largest and most important city in Louisiana at this time, was only separated from St. James by one other parish.  This close proximity allowed ideas and practices to quickly reach neighboring localities.  Furthermore, between 1870 and 1872, with the reorganization of parish boundaries immediately outside the city, New Orleans' top officials were all Republicans.  This political control was greatly beneficial to African Americans.  Republicans were more sympathetic to African American needs than Democrats, and often provided them with the necessary help to secure positions of public office.  Whether or not these law enforcement officials were in office solely because of Republican political dominance in the area at this time, it is nonetheless noteworthy that these African American men were able to govern themselves in the face of harsh white backlash so soon after the war."],"display_date":"September 21, 1871","search_date":"1871-09-21","locations":[{"id":5681,"lat":30.0360710159,"lng":-90.7802066297,"zoom":10,"place":"ST JAMES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2986,"title":"All men are created equal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-12-11","end_date":"1893-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Religious faith and rhetoric dominated nearly every aspect of life for both blacks and whites following Reconstruction in the South. For them, God was an integral factor that offered life guidance in religious terms. Thus, if one failed to adhere to the principles upheld by their religion, they were condemned in religious and social regards. In 1893, Reverend W. Walker Jubb gave a sermon describing the good intentions yet incompetent act to initiate social equality programs in society. Prior to conversing about the subject of Rev. Jubb's sermons, some background is needed. Rev. Jubb of Fall River, Massachusetts preached to a congregation in Baltimore on Dec, 12, 1893. He began preaching in England, before coming to the states and advocating the differences in men are God's works which should not be overturned. In his sermon, he stated, Every man has his own allotted place in society...each class has an intimate relation to some other class, and all, according to the divine plan, are intended to work out the wise and beneficent purpose of the almighty.","This quote exemplifies the attitudes of conservative white southerners throughout the South during this time. For them, they believed that true religion did not allow the restructuring of society which was of divine order and that through a literal, fundamental interpretation of the Bible, allowed social institutions like slavery to exist and persist for centuries. Rev. Jubb, and members of his congregation, recognized that the religious ideas that have shaped their lives should be applied to political issues. Religion provides a measure of law and reform.","Many have recognized the influence that religion has had on political and social attitudes maintained throughout their institutions. Little reform to alleviate poverty and illiteracy among African-American communities were initiated in the south because of the public's contentment with inequality between whites and blacks. Rev. Jubb iterates, Education can give habits of mind, information, memory, power of attention. But can education give the instinctive eagle glance of genius. For many in the South, the answer to this would be an instantaneous, and probably, emphatic no. ","Moreover, this example of a cross between politics and religion, illustrates the importance of the church and religious leaders. The Church was able to serve social and political purposes. Individuals were unable to tackle these dilemmas single-handedly, therefore, the Church would convene to determine an appropriate solution. Morality suddenly fell within the grasps of the Church, and the individual thus lost the ability to rationalize by oneself. The Church had true power in the South, for whatever they ordained was subsequently followed. Charles Wilson made the statement, that even if the preachers were speaking about something meaningless or trivial, the people listened. The yielded mass support, with very little burden. Wilson also stated that they had the ability to become demigods if they fully supported the idea. The religious leaders were also important aspects following Reconstruction. When racial tensions were elevated, the public turned to these specific individuals to fight for their cause. Just like with Rev. Jubb, he defended the institutions presently at work within the South as being consistent with God's plans. He was a regional spokesman, however I believe that the ideals possessed by Rev. Jubb shows how the word of God can be deliberately altered to fit a political purpose. Christianity places extreme emphasis on equality and the fair treatment of one's fellow man. To be antagonistic towards blacks, disobeys the Word, thus is not Christian. A great writer at the time, William Faulkner, explicitly observes the South's attempt to alter religion during this time; I think that the trouble with Christianity is that we've never tried it yet. For if they did, would effortlessly determine that the rhetoric of people like Rev. Jubb as overtly wrong."],"display_date":"December 11, 1893","search_date":"1893-12-11","locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2987,"title":"Convict Standoff\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-07-13","end_date":"1886-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was already hot. As the Superintendent lined the convicts up to march back to the Dade County coal mines for another day of exhausting labor, one group refused to move. At the head of a long line of men chained together, the leader of the rebellion spoke up to Colonel Tower. He said that he and all the rest of the men from his stockade refused to work another day in the heat at their awful work. He defied the Superintendent to shoot them down- they were prisoners for life anyway and nothing could be worse than what they were set to do. ","Faced with such a situation, Colonel Tower immediately informed Governor McDaniel. Alarmed at the prospect of a rebellion and a breakdown in the convict lease system, Governor McDaniel ordered out the military and held them ready to intervene if necessary. After some consideration, Colonel Tower decided that the best way to control this outburst of Senator Joe Brown?s leased convicts was to starve them out. Feeling comfortable with the measures taken to guard the compound of stockades and with the presence of military backup, Tower put his method into action. Forty-eight hours later, the convicts were still without food, and the residents of nearby Cole City were fearful of vengeful attack. Colonel Tower stood by the stockade with the inmates inside all night. He tried persuasion and threats, keeping a conversation going with the convicts. By daybreak, the rebels were hungry-and a few of them were hungrier than the rest. These few decided that they wanted to surrender, that they had had enough. Their fellow convicts immediately set upon them physically, upset with their actions. Despite this show of force on the part of the rebellion?s leaders, the sentiments of the few soon spread to the rest. By the end of that day, all save one of the rebels had surrendered the cause. ","This episode is indicative of the perils of the southern convict lease system in the post-war period. As historian Mark Carleton notes, this plentiful source of cheap labor was irresistible to southern state governments with prison management problems. Indeed all southern states used the system after the 1870s. This episode indicates the support politicians gave the system because the leases were a source of state revenue at the same time as they eliminated the drain on the state to house and feed criminals. As evidenced in the protests of these convicts in Dade County, the workers were poorly fed and cared-for and suffered physical abuse by those overseeing their work. Carleton makes the point that as convicted criminals, no one was concerned for their well-being. Thus, when conditions became unbearable, they had to speak up for themselves. Indeed, the terrible conditions described by the convicts here appear to historians today to been a very like those under slavery in the antebellum south.

While this petty incident of crime was relatively unnoticed, buried in the middle of the paper, the style in which the brief story was written illustrates the social opinions in this southern city. The story goes on to describe how the black man acted in a deceitful and dishonest way to hide the pocketbook and claim that he knew nothing of robbery. When question for his theft, the man stated that it was his belief that the women had misplaced the pocketbook and that he had not taken it. However, the end result for the black man was the dismissal of his services: he is now minus a home.What is important about this incident is that it demonstrated the fears of whites about what free blacks would do to the order of white communities. Since the days of slavery, the majority of blacks were viewed as dangerous and uneducated. The fears of whites were constantly perpetuated by stories of criminal activity by blacks against white communities. Furthermore, the expanding economic and social influences of the black community intimidated many whites.The Atlanta Riots of 1906 showed this tension in full force. While many Southern cities forced the close interactions of free blacks and whites, the growing economic competition for jobs led to the boiling over of much aggression. Additionally, poverty played a large motive for crime in the poor Southern economies after the Civil War. Furthermore white women being taken advantage of by their black male servants was perhaps the greatest fear in regards to racially motivated crime. Consequently the article proclaims through subtle word usage that the black man is undeniably guilty despite the unsubstantiated evidence. While the goal of the Virginian-Pilot was predominantly to sell papers, it is clear why a newspaper would not attempt to seem biased toward blacks in their articles.  Just as white business owners viewed the loss of customers as a disincentive to hire blacks, so too did newspapers see the disincentive to positively reporting blacks.

Wiltberger, while sitting at breakfast one morning, was interrupted by his overseer. The overseer angrily informed Wiltberger that Jane, one of Wiltberger's slaves, was missing. Other slaves were being questioned but so far, the overseer could find out nothing. Incensed, Wiltberger questioned his slaves further, but to no avail. He then picked up his pen and proceeded to write an advertisement to the Argus, the Savannah newspaper, calling on all whites to help him regain his property. He offered a 50 reward for the capture of his slave. He described her as a Mulatto Female Slave, named JANE, about eighteen years of age-5 feet two or three inches high-stout and well made-a pleasing and intelligent countenance-long jet black hair. The ad first appeared on July 14, and two months later, was still being printed in every issue of the newspaper. "," Wiltberger's description of Jane does a great deal to reveal why Jane had been successful in evading capture thus far. First, he described her as mulatto meaning that she had lighter skin than most enslaved people. Often, potential slave buyers were hesitant to buy lighter skinned slaves because they had a better chance of successfully escaping. Also, once away, a lighter skinned African American would have a better chance of blending into white society. Wiltberger's ad and the length of time it stayed in the newspaper, both demonstrate the basis on which these fears were founded. Wiltberger also described her as having a pleasing and intelligent countenance. Because many white southerners associated whiteness with intelligence and blackness with ignorance, lighter skinned slaves proved more of a liability and a threat to slaveholders because they were thought to be more intelligent and thus more able to run away."," One of a slaveholder's biggest concerns when debating whether or not to buy a slave was if that slave would run away or not. Many For Sale ads in newspapers made a point of stating that the slave being advertised would never run away. This emphasis shows what a huge issue it was in slave society and the lengths to which a slaveholder would go to in order to regain his property. Jane might not have been perceived as such a huge liability initially, however, because of her gender. Seventy-five percent of runaways were male, simply because female slaves gave birth and had the responsibilities of motherhood so early in life. Jane, at age 18, might already have had children that she was abandoning in her bid for freedom. Her gender also, no doubt, helped in her success because a black woman was perceived as far less of a threat than a black man in the South; therefore, she would likely have had an easier time blending into a crowd. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether Jane got away, or whether Wiltberger's ad succeeded.

On August 31, 1899, the unofficial strike of the black men disrupted the handling and loading of ships in the Warwick County port. However, within one day, the shipping company had obtained nearly one hundred white men to fill the vacant jobs. While the stevedores asked the black men to work through the end of the week, in exchange for a promise that the shipping company would reevaluate its hiring of non union whites. The black men declined this offer and stated once again that they would only work if the white men were laid off. As blacks entered into capitalistic competition with whites, the dynamic of race relations changed drastically from what many Southern whites had faced before the War. While this episode indicates the interchange of ideas and economic opportunity, it also shows that skin color played a large role in how minorities dealt with their participation in a predominantly white social and economic order. The blacks that form the union practice a cautiously active role in the economy, stressing interdependence on one another for the strength of the whole, while at the same time engaging in a capitalistic opportunity.What was so risky about the black laborers decision to discontinue working was that it would likely place them into possible unemployment. Despite the economic independence of blacks, as author Robert Ransom describes, many blacks were hired to fill 'black jobs' and were paid 'black wages'. This statement indicates that economic opportunity for blacks remained limited even into the final decades of the nineteenth century. Rather white Southerners have simply adapted institutional barriers barring blacks from equal pay and fair access to economic opportunity. The slow growth of the Southern economy after the Civil War negatively affected all races and maximized the economic competition in the marketplace. In a social order determined by whites it was highly unlikely that the blacks would succeed in leveraging for more pay or greater opportunity in the marketplace. The organization of the blacks in the Longshoremen union certainly increased the leverage of the blacks, but had little realistic ability accomplish their motive.

Accused of the crime were two white men, Sam Beale and James Brittle, and a colored man named Edward White. The September 7, 1899 issue of the Virginian-Pilot describes how the men are accused of the brutal bludgeoning of McDonald and then placing his body on train tracks. However the paper goes on to say that expert witnesses described how Patrick McDonald was murdered prior to be struck by the train.The collaborative efforts of the racial mixed attackers against the white tramp appear to have been senselessly carried out. While the newspaper fails to provide a motive for the crime, one can presume that the criminals had petty motives for the murder of this vagrant. Furthermore race appears not to be the driving factor behind the violence. Just as white and black indentured servants had relied on one another to escape from their owners prior to the Civil War, it appears that the white and black individuals relied on one another in the 1890's. The trust that must be present for the men to have jointly executed a crime must have strengthened the men's bond. In this situation it appears that a common socio-economic scenario for all the criminals served as a source of personal identification rather than race. Additional examples of random violence can be found within the black community. A September 30, 1891 article from the Norfolk Virginian describes the robbery of a black couple on an evening walk through the park. Upon being questioned by police, the black women described being held up by two black men. In this case both the robber and the victims were blacks. What is notable about these events is that random violence does not occur across set boundaries and follows no set patterns. This indicates that murder was not merely confined to the stereotypical perception of whites lynching blacks or blacks murdering whites. Rather as blacks began to assimilate into a predominantly white society, people began to look toward commonalities of social and economic status rather than skin color. Furthermore as additional exposure to blacks emerged and racial lines became more blurred, race was not always seen as the defining factor.

The citizens expressed outrage at the legislation, saying themselves and other citizens were prepared to disobey the law because slaves across Southern plantations already had the ability to read. They further expressed their opinion that the law would not be enforced in the state, except in cases of malicious and spiteful intent on some slaveholders' parts to punish men better than themselves. The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance. They argued that general ignorance within the slave population is more of a threat because it would make slaves much more susceptible to the influences of any Nat Turner type character that might pass through the region. The petition ended with the scornful question does chivalrous South Carolina quail before gangs of cowardly Africans with a Bible in their hands?","    Despite the moral and Christian basis of this petition, this appeal and many others like it were continually rejected by the state legislators. According to historian Walter Edgar, South Carolina was known across the antebellum South as the most stringent state with regards to teaching blacks, both free and enslaved. However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon. This episode is an excellent illustration of the different pressures felt by white Southerners throughout the antebellum period: recognizing slaves as human souls entitled to the same rights as whites versus slaves as commodities upholding the economic and cultural basis of Southern culture."],"display_date":1834,"search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":11463,"lat":34.6920570183,"lng":-81.1595343266,"zoom":10,"place":"CHESTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3050,"title":"A Petition on Behalf of a Slave Named Royal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-01-01","end_date":"1824-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Several citizens of upstate South Carolina approached the state assembly with a petition concerning a runaway slave of special concern to the region. Several years earlier a South Carolina citizen by the name of George Ford had been murdered by a slave named Joe (also called Forest) owned by a Mr. Carroll of Richland County. Both Mr. Ford's relatives, as well as the state, offered more than 1,000 dollars for the capture of the runaway slave, but no one was successful in apprehending him. Joe was actually so successful in evading capture that he arose as a leadership figure for other runaway slaves in the area, and established a camp of criminal runaways in the depths of the local swamp."," The local citizens had continued to grow more and more uneasy about the presence of this camp of slaves in their community, fearing the group was planning a large scale insurrection. They had petitioned the state and Commander- in- Chief to call in proper military forces to dispel the rebellious camp. When the state did not respond to their requests they took matters into their own hands and formed a civilian militia, intent on finding and eliminating the threat themselves. The expedition was unsuccessful until a slave named Royal, owned by a citizen of Richland County, guided the militia to Joe's camp, allowing the group of fugitives to be captured and hanged for attempted murder. More than 70 citizens signed the petition asking the assembly to grant full compensation to the slave Royal for his assistance in serving the state and the citizens in the capture. The general assembly rewarded Royal's owner seven hundred dollars compensation to delegate to Royal as she saw appropriate."," The above petition provides a view into the complex racial relations in upstate South Carolina, as well as those typical across the antebellum South. The Richland district was one of largest cotton producing regions of South Carolina during this period, and was therefore one of the districts most reliant upon slave labor, resulting in a majority black population. The reality of a black majority may have resulted in a kind of reign of terror, much like other areas of the South with large slave populations. According to historian Walter Edgar, the period before this petition was issued was dotted with incidences of slave revolts across South Carolina: Columbia in 1805, Camden in 1816, and more rumors of rebellion in the coastal areas in 1822. The uneasiness of the white slave owners is clearly represented in the description of this petition and the citizens' insistence on finding the runaway slave and his camp of followers, as well as their desire to reward faithful slaves. The situation illustrated here shows the typical contrast between the wariness of Southerners with respect to threats to the system of slavery and their absolute reliance on slaves as faithful servants and members of Southern communities."],"display_date":1824,"search_date":"1824-07-01","locations":[{"id":11634,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3051,"title":"Fleeing Louisiana on a Steamboat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-01","end_date":"1862-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the middle of the night Richard, the Fearn's son, awoke his parents to tell them that New Orleans had fallen to the Yankees. During breakfast this unsettling news was reinforced as a man rode by the Fearn home yelling, The Yankees are coming It was clear to the Fearns that they had to leave their home as soon as possible. In the panic to depart, Mrs. Fearn was too distraught. She could barely think clearly of things that she needed to bring with her. Thankfully, her slaves were of a more secure mindset. They packed all the essentials the family would need. Richard departed to return to the army and the Fearns went to Donaldsville to board their steamboat. Eighteen slaves accompanied them. That morning the Mississippi River was full of distressed Southerners fleeing from their homes to become refugees. ","When federal troops seized southern Louisiana in 1862 many white Louisianans fled to avoid Union occupation. Many who left southern Louisiana first went to northern Louisiana before they headed to Mississippi, or more likely, Texas. It was common to take along a few of the most prized slaves during flight. These refugees faced terrible conditions. First and foremost, leaving their homes and knowing that Union soldiers would take advantage of their possessions caused great psychological distress for fleeing Confederates. As city populations began to swell with the incoming refugees, resources like food and medicine, became harder and harder to come by. ","As a result of this chaos, refugee masters often lost much control over their slaves. Like their masters, slaves' lives were also turned upside down. Slave families were separated at higher rates because refugee masters only took those that were absolutely necessary. Everyday plantation life allowed the master to take on a role of extreme power, which was undermined while fleeing.

D. Wren, the executer of Thomas Blackwell's estate, about the sale off this estate to take place on January 15, 1821 (or the next fair day). The sale consisted of all household and kitchen furniture as well as horses several negroes. All items were slated to be sold to the highest bidder. Credit was to be allowed for the purchase of some items; however the more expensive items (presumably the negroes) required the use of cash. The house of Thomas Blackwell was then to be rented for one year, with several negroes being hired out for the balance of the year. The last thing Wren mentioned in the notice is for anyone who had a claim against Blackwell's estate to come forward before the sale, so that they could be compensated after the sale for the balance that is owed."," The direct sale of slaves in Richmond during the early 1800s was frowned upon if it split up families or was deemed cruel in anyway. Richmond differed from plantation Virginia in this aspect, as in a city fewer slaves were needed and conditions were somewhat better. This specific sale is unusual because the enslaved people were being sold off due to the death of their master. Blackwell's estate was being auctioned to pay off debts that he had incurred during his life, and the slaves would bring in a substantial sum of money for this purpose. This episode is significant with regard to slave sales because it shows that while the sale of slaves may not have been the economic force it was in the deeper South this early in the nineteenth century, it was not so taboo that a man would shy away from posting about a sale in a commonly read newspaper."," This episode also shows how information was passed in this time period in a large city such as Richmond. The newspaper was used as a public forum for information such as this, for no better medium existed through which to inform the masses of current events. This was very important for Richmond, as the common events of daily life in the city would generally be recorded in the newspaper, making all aware of events going on in their city's daily life.

Sheriff Rogers of Jasper had in his custody the three men believed to be responsible for the murder: Floyd Woodlee, John Turner, and Cal Collins. In fact, Woodlee was the only man who confessed to the act. Sheriff Rogers was keeping the men in the county jail until such time as their trial could take place. However, a mob surrounded the jailhouse, demanding that the men be released to them. They were determined to get the men and to take them away, but the mob refrained from actually breaking into the jail with force. ","Sheriff Rogers went outside and stood among the crowd. He spoke to them calmly, rationally persuading them that justice was sure to take its course in the case. He quieted the mob with his speech and they eventually began to go home. The mob dispersed of its own accord, satisfied as it was that the three men would be found guilty and hanged anyway, with very little trouble to them. But the heat was not off. J.T. Simpson, a citizen of Jasper prognosticated that the black men would very likely be lynched, even over the protests of the sheriff, next time the mob assembled, if they were not found guilty of George Dawson's murder. ","This 1892 narrative seems to be an anomaly in the history of lynching in the South. That the local law enforcement prevented lynching in this case is particularly significant given that in this same year, the number of lynchings of black men across the south reached its peak- 155 men killed over the course of this one year. The scenario of the mob surrounding the jail, demanding that the offenders be released to them was common- if the suspected offenders even made it into the jailhouse alive. Some who study the phenomenon of lynching postulate that the practice became common around the turn of the century in the South because of weak social institutions, weak civic institutions, and ineffective law enforcement. They say that all these factors failed to develop sufficiently and so failed to instill in their communities a respect for the rule of law. However, we see in this episode a law enforcement agent standing up to the mob effectively, something that probably occurred rarely. Indeed, in many accounts of lynchings, local officers of the law participated or even instigated the incidents. The incident is tempered through with the prediction that the men protected by Sheriff Rogers will surely be convicted anyway.

Wilkes wrote a letter to Reverend Iveson Lewis Brookes proposing that funds be raised to secure a new Baptist missionary to preach in Jones County, Georgia. Brookes was asked to continue paying 100 to sustain the preaching activities at his Jasper County plantation and to give an additional 100 to secure the second missionary. Wilkes, also a reverend, assured Brookes that another 300 would be provided by the Marion Board and general fundraising. Brookes was very active in Baptist affairs, and also owned hundreds of slaves and at least three plantations, including one in Jones County. He wrote a pamphlet arguing that the Bible served as justification for slavery, and presumably had a previous interest in procuring a preacher for his plantations. The money raised would be enough to procure the services of John H. Clark, an ordained minister living in the field, zealous, persevering, and energetic, whom Wilkes enthusiastically endorsed as the best candidate for the plantation job.","Preaching Christianity to slaves was a problematic endeavor. Although planters wanted their slaves to be Christian and to have eternal salvation from their sins, slavery was not easily reconciled with Christian notions of equality, and many feared that their slaves would become rebellious if they heard these messages. Reverend Brookes was, however, not alone in believing that slavery and religion could be reconciled. According to many slaveholders, Christianity not only supported the institution, but also strengthened it by teaching slaves the ideals of obedience and honesty, reducing the threat of rebellion. Southern missionaries also found themselves torn between their religious beliefs and condoning this peculiar institution. Many believed that slavery was wrong and ungodly and educated slaves when they could. Methodist and Baptist ministers also comprised a significant part of the southern abolitionist movement. Others argued that emancipation was insignificant compared to the need to preach salvation, and they thought that the anti-slavery approach had to be abandoned. Their primary goal was compromised when plantation owners banned missionary activities as a result of their abolitionist efforts. ","Tensions during the Southern Baptist Convention of 1845-seven months before Wilkes' letter was written-resulted in a split between the Northern and abolitionist missionaries and those who supported slavery or were at least willing to meet slave-owners' pro-slavery demands in order to gain access to the plantations. Methodist and Presbyterian organizations experienced a similar division. One result of this schism in the Baptist Church was the creation of a board for Domestic Missions in Marion, Alabama, which is probably the 'Marion Board' mentioned by Wilkes in his letter. A prominent figure in national Baptist politics, Reverend Brookes might have been one of the pro-slavery voices during the Convention meetings, but if not, he certainly supported their view.

Bridges of Wilcox County, Alabama, desperately penned a letter to the Southern Recorder, the Columbian Telescope, the Carolina Observer, and the Georgia Advertiser on May 27, 1820, looking for a runaway slave by the name of Aaron. A few weeks prior to the publication of this letter, Aaron, a stout well-fed Negro man of 30 years standing around 5'10 had escaped from the John Bridges' plantation a few miles below Prairie-Bluff in eastern Alabama. The slave, further described as a little yellow and missing part of one ear, had also stolen from the plantation a long shotgun, ammunition, and twenty pounds of bacon, further upsetting his owner. Aaron's apparel remained somewhat unknown to his owner. Bridges speculated that he could have escaped wearing a dark colored homespun boater or a blue homespun coat with a black hat and a pair of shoes. Bridges continued, speculating that Aaron was headed to Carolina by Cahawba or Montgomery counties, although it is not apparent how he reached this conclusion. He ended by promising a monetary reward for returning Aaron or having him secured in jail in South Carolina or Georgia. ","Previously, the late John Jones had been his owner, but Aaron had become Bridges' slave shortly after Jones' death. Deaths of owners like Jones often led to the breakup of families at slave auctions that frequently followed the death of a slave owner. Despite the pleadings of slave families, sellers regularly sold each individual member of the family to different buyers. Although slaves left their owners for a wide variety of reasons, it is likely from Bridges' speculation on Aaron's eventual location, which he thought would be near his former plantation, that he ran away in the hopes of re-uniting with his family. The letter to the editor from Bridges also details precisely what goods Aaron took with him as he escaped the plantation. Slave owners especially feared runaway slaves that had the ability to defend themselves, so Bridges' specifically noted that Aaron took a shotgun and ammunition from the farm. The fear that slaves would rebel violently constantly loomed on the minds of slave holders across the South, proving that much of the basis of slavery rested on the monopoly on violence that slave holders held over their slaves. If slave holders lost this monopoly, they would likely lose slavery as an institution as well.

The slaves put much effort into the night to make it the happiest of times. Slaves on the plantation looked forward to the ball each year. This year the ball fell on a beautiful night. The Fearns were the last to leave for the ball. As they followed the path to get there, a large slave armed with knives approached Mr. Fearn. This slave had run away three months before to avoid the harsh demands of the sugar-grinding season. The plantation owner ordered the slave to put down his weapons. Out of respect for Mr. Fearns authority the slave fell to the owner's feet and begged to go to the ball. The master agreed to allow him to attend the ball, but warned he would be subject to the punishment by the other slaves. Upon entering the ball he was severely beaten by his fellow slaves and dragged from the ball.","Oftentimes runaway slaves were not punished directly by their owners. Many owners thought that runaways were just an inevitable part of slaveholding. Although slave escapes were a common occurrence, they did not cause much excitement. In fact an owner did not advertise that he had a runaway until that slave had been missing for several weeks. This composure about runaways was due to the fact that most slaves returned to the plantation because they could not bear to leave their families. It was assumed that a successful runaway would never return to the plantation he or she left and would leave his family forever. ","Family was one of the most treasured aspects of life for slaves. The Christmas season was the best time of the year for slaves because it enabled slaves to spend time with their families. Slaves were permitted to take a break from their grueling work to enjoy the holidays. On sugar plantations throughout Louisiana this leisure period was often pushed back until the end of January - after the grinding season. It was common that a dinner and a ball were held in honor of the slaves. Dancing was the most popular activity for the slaves. They danced long into the night. Fellow slaves played music and were sometimes able to make money doing so. Masters often gave their slaves gifts during the Christmas season and may have even given them passes to go where they pleased, within a certain distance, during the rest of their break. There were obvious limitations to the festivities that the slaves were able to enjoy, but it is clear that the Christmas season at least gave enslaved people something to look forward to each year."],"display_date":"April 1862","search_date":"1862-04-15","locations":[{"id":5562,"lat":29.3204554147,"lng":-90.0865534097,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3071,"title":"New Orleans Slave Market\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-04-27","end_date":"1855-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Human beings sold as cattle was a most atrocious sight for many of the on looking slaves held in the slave markets.

Slaves trekked a long journey, sometimes states away, to New Orleans wearing shackles around their ankles and wrists. These men, women, and children were held as prisoners before and during the sales. Men and women were separated in the pens where they were subjected to physical abuse and derogatory insults. Family ties were eliminated by slaves being filed according to sex and in a descending line. In the markets, slaves were not viewed as human beings but as a possession with a price. This process of dehumanization involved white men physically examining slaves, dressing them according to the category under which they were to be sold, and being made to dance around to prove their bodies were fully capable of work. According to the book,<em> Soul by Soul</em>, during the sale period, their nights were spent in the jails, their days were spent exercising in the yard or being examined in the showrooms in the main building.","Many slave traders in New Orleans believed in making the sale quick with a large profit with little regard to the risks.

Though Mrs. Todd's passing initially appeared peaceful, the true happenings behind her death were revealed in the subsequent battle for ownership of Mrs. Todd's will. On July 31, 1897 Judge Burroughs resided over the court that was set to declare the official executer of Lucinda Todd's estate. The plaintiff, Mrs. Todd's daughter Josephine Sykes, had accused her brother, Mr. Charles H. Todd, by fraud and deceit....compelled his mother to convey to him by deeds, her entire estate worth ten thousand dollars. These are among the statements provided by the official court transcript when the case appeared to the Supreme Court of Appeals at Richmond. The court was given the task to divide the ten thousand dollar estate of Mrs. Todd, which included properties on Chapel Lane, Henry Street, and Bottimore Roads in Norfolk. What makes this case so intriguing however is the witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, Mrs. Sykes. Ms. Rachiel Crowell was close to Mrs. Todd in her final days. She had traveled to Norfolk to care for Mrs. Todd in the three weeks before she passed away. Ms. Rachiel Crowell was a black woman. Sitting on the court bench, Ms. Crowell answered questions regarding arguments between Charles Todd and Lucinda Todd. However what was important within the historical context was not the questions asked but rather the fact that a black woman was giving testimony against a white man. Prior to the end of the Civil War, blacks were unable to testify against whites. This often prevented enslaved blacks from defending themselves from unwarranted allegations and defending their family members. However the introduction of blacks to the civil and criminal cases allowed for black witnesses with valuable information to provide key witness information.In the case of Sykes vs. Todd, the testimony of Rachiel Crowell proved vital to the eventual conviction of Charles H. Todd. The altercation between Charles Todd and his mother Lucinda Todd was a key component of the courts decision to rule in Mrs. Sykes favor. While Crowell noted no physical abuse, she did take note of the vulgar language and aggressive manner in which Charles Todd approached his mother. The lasting implications of court cases such as Sykes vs. Todd include an increasingly equal legal system. Despite being too late to rectify the legal system in the pre war South, the post bellum era of legal equality as recognized under the fourteenth amendment provided the ability to improve the legal process.

Lewis Boyd, a black man, hopped up into the car to help unload the flour. As he removed the sacks of flour from the car, he happened to throw some of them to the ground. Conductor Shell reprimanded Boyd for his carelessness and Boyd took great offense. Boyd began to mutter and to curse the conductor out loud. Shell immediately responded, telling Boyd to stop. At this, Boyd snapped and he jumped onto Shell from the train car, hitting him on the head with a large stone. As Shell fell to the ground, Boyd hit him again and began kicking him. Other men working on the train rushed to the scene and restrained him. Boyd, seeing how badly Shell was hurt, ran for a nearby swampy area. However, the trainmen gave chase and brought him back. ","Meanwhile, word spread of what had happened. As Boyd was apprehended and brought back to town, a mob assembled, ready to kill Boyd for what he had done. The trainmen averted a lynching by hurrying Boyd off to the judge in Rogersville, who promptly threw Boyd in jail. At his trial, Boyd claimed Shell was the cause of the incident, that his actions were provoked. ","As railroads spread across the country in the period after the Civil War, they did more than just move goods for commerce from one place to another. They allowed people to move in, out, and around the south to a much greater degree than ever before. Thus, there were more unfamiliar faces- white and black- in towns where the railroad came. We don?t know if Boyd knew Shell personally, but it seems unlikely given the immediate hostility that arose between them on the day of the incident and given Boyd?s extreme actions. Historians have pointed out that these new social situations called for a more complex level of interaction than both white people and black people had been used to in the antebellum period. Indeed, race relations in these urban areas with people coming in and out were more impersonal and confrontational; thus a situation in which a railroad worker insulted a conductor and then attacked and severely injured him would be more likely to occur.

Indeed, attendants of the People's Party mass meeting in Thomson Friday, December 5, were deeply stirred as Pearson described his wife who requested that she wanted to give something to help Mr. Watson get his rights. Of course, the Mr. Watson whom Pearson's wife referenced in her last moments was none other than Thomas Watson - the darling of the Populist Party in his campaign for reelection to the House of Representatives. Pearson circled the gathered crowd and, recalling his wife's indelible devotion and enthusiasm for Mr. Watson, sought to invigorate the gathered members and inspire them to act likewise. A People's Party Paper correspondent covering the meeting wrote, It stirs very deeply, very, very deeply, when I think of this good old woman, lying in pain and in the awful shadow of death, and yet having her heart so full of zeal in the cause as to make her last act on earth a proof of her devotion to it, and her last message one of cheer to me. Following such an emotional appeal by Pearson, it is difficult to believe someone would be averse to working for such a man as a Mr. Watson and his populist cause, and yet opponents abounded in his reelection campaign.","What became of Joseph Pearson and his quest to fulfill his wife's dying wish is unknown; however, it may be said that his efforts were part-in-parcel of Watson's eventual reelection to the House of Representatives as a Populist in 1892. Not only was Watson one of the founders of Georgia's Populist Party, but he was also a brilliant orator and incredibly charismatic speaker. Both of these traits helped him climb the ranks of the Populist Party as he strove to unite agrarians across class lines and overcome racial divides. Later, he even advocated for the right of African American men to vote - a radical appeal for a Populist to make given the party's traditional base among white farmers. Unfortunately, Watson's early support for and among African Americans like Joseph Pearson soured after the failure of the Populist Party to fuse tickets with the Democrats in the elections of 1896 and 1898. Watson blamed minorities in the South for the Party's failures on the electoral field of battle and thenceforth transformed into a bitter racist. Watson had always harbored intense anti-Semite and anti-Catholic sentiments, but given his early support for African American rights, few could guess that he would eventually call for the reorganization of the Ku Klux Klan. Watson proceeded on to the national political stage as both a vice presidential candidate in 1896 and a presidential candidate in 1904. He failed, however, to receive enough support to elect him on either front. ","When Watson initially formed the Populist Party in Georgia, it appealed primarily to white farmers, due to its emphasis on agricultural protectionism in the South following low cotton prices in previous decades. On a more national level, the Party advocated for issues like free and unlimited coinage of silver, the abolition of national banks, a system of graduated income tax, public ownership of the railroads, steamship lines and telephone and telegraph systems, and direct election of United States Senators. Fierce competition from Democrats - who were still a viable force in the South at the time - demanded that the Populists appeal not only to the white populace in Georgia but also to African American Republicans. This initiative to attract the black vote obviously proved successful in the case of Pearson's deceased wife. Emotional appeals like Pearson's prove the overwhelming success of Watson in reaching out to the African American populace - an incredibly symbolic attempt which struck a strong chord among many and enabled him to claim bi-racial support on agrarian issues."],"display_date":"December 5, 1892","search_date":"1892-12-05","locations":[{"id":1819,"lat":34.426000328,"lng":-83.2423737095,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3101,"title":"Charleston Suffers a Cold Spell\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-02-01","end_date":"1895-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" In February of 1895, Charleston experienced the coldest winter ever on record up to that date.

Specifically, a man would receive an additional vote for each 500 worth of property he owned up to 5000. Thus, a wealthy man could have his vote count for ten times as much as a poor man's ballot. The stated purpose of this plan was to counteract the African American majority in South Carolina. As an analysis of the proposal states, the plan would wipe out the colored majority of 40,000 voters and insure a white majority of 20,000.

Proposals such as these would eventually build up to the Supreme Court validation of segregation in Plessey v. Ferguson and decades of African American segregation under Jim Crow laws.

Fairman. In an incredibly vehement and highly-charged poem submitted to the People's Party Paper, Fairman charges niggers with nothing less than starting the Civil War, the subsequent complete and utter destruction of the South, and the sorry fate of so many people in the South. He again cites niggers when condemning the Populist movement to failure saying, The argument against the independent political movement in the South may be boiled down into one word - NIGGER. He continues this violent rant until his concluding verse when he writes, Pious Southern people never dreaded death so much as they do now. They fear that when they knock at the pearly gates of the New Jerusalem St. Peter will peep through the key-hole and say: 'You can't come in.''Why?' 'NIGGER' ","Though many Americans struggled to come together as a nation and forge new ties following the end of the Civil War, not all individuals were able or ready to do so. Fairman seems to be a prime example of such an individual. He places all misfortunes in life, be they economic, political, social, or otherwise, in the hands of African Americans. This is not extraordinarily uncommon in the post-Civil War South. As Fairman walked the streets of Atlanta in 1892, he was likely confronted with new changes in the public sphere which were difficult to swallow for those accustomed to seeing African Americans working in the fields. Not only were African Americans given the right to vote - a hallowed white power stronghold - but in the period of Reconstruction from 1865-1877, African Americans also integrated into the social, legal, economic, and political systems in a variety of ways. ","Of course, Fairman's incredibly hostile and racist poetry is one of many responses to the empowerment of African Americans in Southern society during post-Civil War reconciliation. When Reconstruction concluded in 1877, the regime of Jim Crow assumed slavery's place, reigning over the South with institutions intended to disenfranchise and segregate African Americans from whites. The associated wave of repression and terrorism via lynchings and other forms of vigilante violence ensured that many African Americans were kept under the thumb of white supremacists. Fortunately, not all African Americans fell prey to white supremacists' power. Many were able to achieve progress and success during the Progressive Era despite several obstacles.

They had drunk their coffee and eaten breakfast as usual that morning, but began to feel ill soon afterwards. The shared pain made them wonder if someone had poisoned them. As it turned out, someone had slipped poisonous Jameson weed into their coffee. But who would do such a thing? That evening as the family recovered, the police arrested a black woman name Frances for the crime and planned to try her the next morning. ","Adolphus Sterne described this event in his diary on July 21, 1841. The only information Sterne gave about Frances was that she was a negro woman. This presumably meant that Frances was one of the Hyde family's household slaves, possibly a cook since she had access to their coffee. Frances's method of murder is significant as Joshua D. Rothman explains: In most cases, women were physically weaker than their owners. When they wished to harm a master or his family, arson or poisoning were more typical weapons of choice. True to Rothman's statement, Frances used poison as a way to injure her master and his family. Her physical limitations as a woman and the ease of obtaining poison and administering it made poisoning her preferred weapon. ","That their own household slave tried to murder them no doubt came as a shock to the Hyde family, and indeed upset many other white families in the area. When slaves rose up against their masters, regardless of the context in which they did so, they implicitly threatened all masters and all whites, observes Rothman. Frances's attempt set a dangerous precedent. If a slave woman could almost murder a family, what could a slave man, or worse a band of slave men do? Episodes like this created feelings of fear and distrust in the minds of slave owners. It also opened the way for other such crimes on the part of slaves. Thus the people had to act quickly on this matter. They planned to try Frances the very next day because they needed to show that they would not tolerate such undermining of a master's authority.

Through acts of violence and intimidation, Ku Klux members aimed to scare free blacks into adopting a sense of second-class citizenship. In 1875, the Louisville-Courier Journal reported that a young negro girl had recovered after being shot in the eye by Ku Klux members, though her vision was still quite defective. While the paper does not print her name, they do offer an insight into the attack, writing, ?How the ball could have cut the eye without touching the face in any other place is one of them things no fellow can find out.?

Hooded men rode on horseback, aiming to destroy radical political organizations and disperse African American gatherings. ","While somewhat successful at keeping these union organizers away, the real impact of the Ku Klux Klan was the return of southern social culture. The Civil War and Reconstruction robbed the South of its identity. The Ku Klux Klan worked to keep blacks from voting or receiving formal educations. Ultimately though, the Klan failed in restoring white supremacy. It had irresponsible leaders who used the Klan as a veil to commit murder and robbery, and it had no centralized control. In 1869, the grand wizard announced the formal disbandment of the order. However, it is clear that the Ku Klux Klan did not simply disappear.

One slave, James Boyd, was 107 years old when he was interviewed in 1937 in Itasca, Texas. Boyd recalled his hardships of being a slave vividly. While he was not treated awfully, he acknowledged that slaves were treated very poorly and no rights whatsoever. In fact, two of his white owners once whipped two black women to death and never received any repercussions. Boyd realized that as a slave he had no rights or legitimacy under the law as they did not have a jail because, they didn't go to the trouble and expense of buildin' nigger jails. They just whipped us when they wanted to. Under these conditions, it is no wonder that most slaves desired freedom and some attempted to attain it."," Although slavery was such an institutional stronghold, many slaves continually tried to escape to nearby Mexico. Boyd notes that many Texan slaves did run off and try to go north... most in general 'round our part of the country, iffen a nigger want to run away, he'd light out for old Mexico. Crossing the Mexican-Texas border provided instant freedom for the slaves, and, therefore, many slaves would attempt escape for salvation. The Mexican government welcomed the runaways as a way to weaken the slave institution in Texas and potentially deter further territorial assaults by the United States. In fact, so many slaves attempted escape that the congress of the republic passed a law to promote capturing runaways. Promoting the capture of runaways was not only an attempt to stifle the Mexico runaway trend, but also an attempt to counter Mexico's encouragement. Despite the escape of at least three thousand slaves to Mexico by 1851, slavery as an institution was not threatened and it continued to be as important in Texas as it was to the rest of the United States."],"display_date":"1850 - 1861","search_date":"1856-01-01","locations":[{"id":12881,"lat":31.198494943,"lng":-95.2644293385,"zoom":8,"place":"HOUSTON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3143,"title":"Sugar Cane on Small Farms in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-07-17","end_date":"1872-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" With the end of slavery, the large sugar plantation of Louisiana suffered major setbacks in output.

Despite the weather, spirits remained high and prominent male and female speakers generated great joy and thunderous applause. The night's favorite performance came in the form of nine year old Mamie, whose solos left the audience shackled by their laughter. The enthusiasm for the temperance celebration surprised even the event's organizers; as the anniversary resulted in complete success. Despite no boring pleas for money, donations covered all the expenses. Sunday, April 24, celebrated by all the local churches as Temperance Day, witnessed mass meetings at several churches, with gripping sermons that kept people in their pews long past when the doxology and benediction normally concluded services. "," Protestant churches in the South regarded the coming of a New, commercial South in the late nineteenth century as a threat to the Old South culture, so deeply rooted in Christianity. Thus, local organizations, often supported by churches, emerged to improve and perfect an increasingly chaotic society. Movements towards Prohibition grew out of these efforts, which more often than not had a strong female presence. Such a seemingly Puritanical movement generated resistance from those who felt the church had overstepped its bounds. Nonetheless, some isolated communities, like Chincoteague Island, were able to construct their own local temperance options, though areas with a larger lower class typically encountered more resistance. "," On a national level, a prohibition party could never succeed due to the differences between temperance supporters in the North and South. Most Northern prohibitionists were Republicans and former abolitionists, anathema to self-respecting Southern elites. Within Virginia, however, the Prohibition Party increased by 1887 to ten times its support in 1884. These followers tended to see bars and saloons as the basis for the wrongs of Southern culture, fostering lewdness and incessant swearing. Oftentimes, the prohibitionists would reach out to blacks for several reasons. First, they were seen as important swing voters who could counteract the usually dominant Democratic Party. Also, there existed religious and class based reasons that white professionals could associate and share the same values with their black counterparts. This sort of mutual respect appears in a statement made by a white, pro-temperance preacher, Let us make a great pile of all the unreasonable race prejudices, all political animosities, all sectional bitterness, all partisan hate.... The most successful nation-wide coalition in the nineteenth century; however, came with the creation of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the first group formed by solely women to act politically. Nevertheless, no state encompassing prohibition laws emerged until later on in the 1900's. Yet, by 1887, Chincoteague rejoiced in finding what they considered a more perfect society.

In this year, the First African Church of New Orleans, which had been officially founded in October of 1826, received two new Baptist pastors after the death of its founding pastor. These Brethren Sanders and Satterfield breathed new life into the church with their worship leadership, and membership flourished once more. In 1837, Elder Peter W. Robert returned the now-Baptist organization to its original form by renaming it the First African Church. Pastors Sanders and Satterfield were ordained in First African Church and carried on preaching the gospel. The church was held in a schoolhouse, but as the church grew, so did weekly collections and therefore finances. By the year 1842 First African had enough money and members to move out of their schoolhouse building and into their own newly constructed church on the corner of Howard and Cypress. "," New Orleans was a city more focused on making money and socializing than worrying about its collective soul. Religious services in white churches were not highly attended. These slave owners kept a lose reign on their slaves in that regard, allowing them to go to church at their own leisure. Because of this bit of freedom, blacks in the area could converge, creating their own churches and organizational hierarchies as illustrated by Elder Peter W. Robert's success. This freedom was most strikingly illustrated by the fact that the First African Church was able to construct itself a new building out of its own money. Those funds had to come from somewhere, and they were probably not being donated by white benefactors.

The fact that slaves were willing to donate what little they had to churches like the First African Church is a testament to the strong backing and community feel that these religious organizations provided to their members.

Washington at the Atlanta Cotton Exposition on Wednesday, September 18, 1895. The talented representative of the negroes and President of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School spoke brilliantly and passionately as he lobbied for African American employment in the burgeoning industrial age. He called upon whites throughout the nation to recognize the burgeoning African American population and their subsequent need of employment in the great leap from slavery to freedom. African Americans had worked under the white yoke for years on end. Could whites yet again place their trust in African Americans to till their fields, plant their crops, and strengthen their business? Washington implored whites to reject the massive influx of immigrants as a source of labor. Why test the mettle of the Irish, Italian, and Eastern European, when a solid and trustworthy base of employment lay right under their nose? The crowd assembled to listen to his speech seized upon several points in Washington's speech, but the passage which best encapsulates his message follows:","To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were I permitted, I would repeat what I say to own race: 'cast down your bucket were you are.' Cast it down among 8,000,000 negroes whose habits you know, whose loyalty and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides. Cast down your buckets among these people who have without strikes and labor wards, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, built your railroads and cities and brought forth treasure form the bowels of the earth and helped make possible this magnificent presentation of the progress of the South. ","Applauded by both blacks and whites alike, Washington's address was one of the most poignant of the entire Convention and arguably in American history. Though some criticized his speech as accomodationist and pandering to the white population, it was still critical in guiding African American resistance to white discrimination and establishing Washington as one of the leading African American spokesmen in America. Ardent in his devotion to African American advancement and education, Washington continued his cooperation with white people, enlisting the support of wealthy philanthropists, to raise funds to establish and operate hundreds of small African American community schools and institutions of higher education.","Reverberations from Washtington's Atlanta Compromise Speech, as it was later called, continue to influence racial politics to this very day. The supposed accomodationist ideas of Washington were frequently juxtaposed with those of other African American leaders of the time. In particular, Frederick Douglass called upon African Americans to Agitate, Agitate, Agitate for social change whereas Washington stressed compliance and hardy work ethic. Washington's ideals also conflicted with other individuals like W.E.B. DuBois who supported the idea of a classical education among African-Americans rather than the industrial model which Washington favored. Both sides sought to define the best means to improve the conditions of the post-Civil War African-American community. Washington's advice to African-Americans was to compromise and accept segregation; however, this perspective incensed other activists like DuBois who labeled him The Great Accommodator."],"display_date":"September 18, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-18","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3181,"title":"Another Negro Boy Caught Stealing\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-04-17","end_date":"1884-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Will Crockett, a thirteen year old boy became the ninth negro boy in a month to be caught stealing and sent to jail in April of 1884, in Wytheville.

","By the end of the Civil War, most blacks expected a swift transition from enslavement to freedom. This did not happen. Reconstruction was arguably the most violent time between races in the South. Whites had for centuries treated blacks as property, and they were forced to free their slaves under the watchful eye of northern officers. ","Two major problems arose during Reconstruction that led to episodes like that of Will Crockett. By 1867, two years after the end of the war, the government in Washington granted suffrage to all freedmen. Three years later the fifteenth amendment passed, declaring that no state could deprive a citizen, regardless of race, of the vote. Gaining a political voice was the ultimate sign of freedom, and one that white southerners were strongly against. White southerners took the law into their own hands, using groups like the Ku Klux Klan to scare blacks away from the polls. By 1877, the Jim Crow laws had been implemented throughout the South ensuring the separation of races. Cleary the Dispatch is in strong favor of Jim Crow.","Alarmingly, Will Crockett was the ninth black boy to be caught stealing in a month in Wytheville. The second problem to arise during Reconstruction was the lack of educational opportunities for African American youths. The Freedmen?s Bureau attempted and was somewhat successful in setting up some schools in the South, but they clearly could not reach the entire South. Often, angry whites along with Ku Klux members would destroy black schools or intimidate the Yankee teachers into leaving. In more rural parts of the South, including Appalachia, many black children were forced to work in order to help the family. They could not attend school. A lack of education among black and white children may have contributed to a higher crime rate. Jim Crow made parts of the South uninhabitable to some blacks and forced others, such as Will Crockett, to test its limits.

Rambin's sore eye and the negligent young man were the least of the Rambins' worries, however. Rambin wrote to her sister that times will be harder here next year then ever before. The Rambins' cotton crop had failed that year because of excessive drought, worrying Rambin about her family's future, and the future of the poor around the area.

A failure of the cotton crop was a constant concern; especially since cotton prices had been continuing to decrease due to a worldwide overproduction of cotton. The difficultly of creating a profit from the cotton crop landed many of the sharecroppers, like the family Mr. Rambin had brought, in debt. Despite the financial hardship these sharecroppers faced, the African Americans were able to gain greater autonomy in this system because it allowed them to choose their own employers. The majority of African Americans remained poor and often in debt, but the ability to regulate their own land and time gave them the independence that they craved after emancipation.

However, the freed African American didn't leave the Augusta area. Instead, he waited until he could purchase and earn his path outside of the region. When Henry decided to leave, Cumming, in 1819, asked for and received the signatures of many white, male aristocrats. They all endorsed the Todd family because of Harry's good conduct, diligence, and positive community reputation. Their endorsement asked for the humanity and protection of all persons whom the family would meet on their travels to search for a place to settle. Fortunately for Henry Todd, white Southern men who met him either heeded the advice of the document or believed Todd in his explanation that he and his family was free, because he lived 40 years past the day he left August. He died at age 92.","Before the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War, masters throughout the South granted freedom to their slaves. Thousands of enslaved African Americans received the same independence as Henry Todd.

They possessed no financial resources, no previous experience participating, at least as a buyer and seller, in a market economy, likely very few or no close family with which to make contacts, and no way to purchase transportation if they desired to migrate. ","Henry Todd, because of his limited opportunity as a newly-freed man, worked on the Cumming plantation until he received endorsement from the local landed gentry. Many freed slaves could only leave their plantation, or function as a free person in the South, if their former masters provided them with an endorsement or provided them with land.","Henry Todd's desire to stay with his family demonstrated the close bonds created by blacks during slavery.

This development occurred amidst a Southern embrace, in the late nineteenth century, of all kinds of sports; southerners of every class, race, and gender eagerly embraced sports and its trappings.

He owned the Staunton <em>Spectator</em> from 1856-1860. The <em>Spectator </em>reached many residents of Augusta County. He kept an extensive diary during his life, of which the years 1855-1865 are still preserved. On October 15, 1856, after having contemplated the hopeless Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and having acknowledged the local impact of national politics, Waddell thought of the assessment of his father's property, earlier that day and gave an estimate of his own possessions. Among those, he noted his printing office, stocks, bonds, two of his slaves, furniture, silverware, and a slew of other commodities, totaling to an understated 8700. His slaves Selena and Moses were mentioned in the middle of Waddell's list of property, but later on in the diary entry, Waddell alluded to a moment earlier in the day when a Dr. McGill offered 1000 for Selena. Waddell wrote that he would not have sold Selena for 20,000, unless she desired to go, or had grossly misbehaved. He continued to espouse his philosophy that, Speculating on human flesh is utterly horrible to me and he explained that he wished slavery were extinct, yet claimed to be no abolitionist and advocated that he lived in a time when emancipation was not prudent."," There was a socially accepted hypocrisy for the slaveholding Southerners. Slaveholders, like Waddell, separated the morality of slavery and the slave market. The slave market was a disgusting profit-driven business, owned by those merchants of disease and disorder slave traders. Historian Walter Johnson illuminates the contradiction that slaveholders could sell slaves as well, but believed that it was not with the intent of making a profit; there was always a noncommercial reason for selling a slave. This invisible line provided enough self-justification for slaveholders to shift the guilt of human exploitation onto those slave traders. Slaveholders were able to control and decide the actions of their slaves because they were property. The hypocrisy lies in the question, if slave traders only sold sub-human property, then why the disgust with slave traders? And if slave traders were trading people, not just property, than how could slaveholders justify owning people?

Rambin explained to her sister that the effort she put into cooking, housework, and the washing caused her to seldom feel like writing. Rambin put special emphasis on the fact that she did her own washing, because many women paid others to do their washing for them. Rambin told her sister that she too could pay someone to do her washing, but preferred to do it herself while she could. Rambin, however, did have help in the kitchen from the hired African American who stayed in the kitchen to get her water and wood.","In the letter to her sister, Rambin also addressed the issue of the girls' (presumably her daughters') schooling. Rambin did not see the point in the girls continuing to go to school for much longer, unless they meant to become teachers. Rambin found the idea of the girls learning French especially ridiculous, since she noted that what French I learned was of very little use to me...and if they were to remain in Louisiana they would not have much use to practice it. She also asked if her sister would write to May M. Allen to see if she would be willing to come to De Soto, Louisiana, to either live with Rambin to teach her children or to teach at the local Catholic Community School. Rambin, however, expressed her fears that Allen would marry and give up teaching, leaving Rambin to finish educating her children on her own.","Rambin's chief concern in her letter, her housework, represents the adjustment many white women had to make after emancipation. They found themselves needing to do their own housework, which required a large amount of time from the former plantation mistresses. Laundry could take up to three days to do, and women often spent just as much time sewing and mending the clothes. In addition to this, women needed to cook, bake, and keep the house clean. Rambin might have been willing to do her own washing, but she still turned to an African American to complete the tasks she did not have time to do herself, and could afford to allocate to someone else. Even with the help of a few African American servants, the adjustment for Southern women to household work often caused resentment towards the North, which was a dominant sentiment in the South during Reconstruction.","Rambin's letter also addresses the changes of education in the South and women's role in education. During and after Reconstruction, Louisiana experienced a statewide decline in public education that resulted in a decrease in white literacy between 1880 and 1890. Private and parochial schools, such as the Catholic Community School Rambin mentions, were often used by whites instead of the poor quality public schools. Rambin did not mention if it was the decline in the educational system that prompted her dislike of keeping her girls in school, but if the Rambins were paying for the girls' education the economic hardship that was continually present in the South probably created a more important use of the money than tutoring in French. Her willingness to allow them to continue school to become teachers reflects the start in the increased amount of female teachers, which would double in number during the upcoming 1880s.

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual."," The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South."," Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

Anderson's travels led him to the coastal area of Georgia where he arrived in Pooler, Georgia, and entered a local village with a black companion.  Anderson's main reason for visiting the town was to sell his book, therefore Anderson's friend wanted to introduce the reverend to his friends in the town, which included some white citizens.  After the two black companions investigated the town together, Anderson's friend introduced Anderson to his white group of friends.

Anderson believed the men bought his book only out of curiosity, yet the reason for the purchase mattered not to the author.  It satisfied Anderson just knowing that a group of white southerners were willing and wanted to buy a book written by a colored man.

He first spoke to them then grabbed their dinner-basket. Fortunately, he let them leave and the two little boys managed to arrive at school safe and sound. Even if the Jackson Gazette wrote it was a harmless robbery, this piece of news was considered significant enough to be the first one on the page who deals with Jackson news.","Nevertheless, such events were common in the South and especially in Tennessee where there was a large number of Slaves. Indeed, West Tennessee had the greatest concentration of slaves in the state, and Middle Tennessee, especially thanks to tobacco and grain cultivation, held the largest number of slaves throughout the antebellum period. Therefore, Jackson was at the core of the slave South. In consequence, Jackson could not avoid a recurrent phenomenon in the antebellum South: lots of slaves, because of their unbearable living conditions tried to run away from their owner's plantation and dreamt about freedom. However, after their evasion, they soon realized that their standard of living would be difficult to improve. Without job, without money, and sometimes with a family to feed, they sometimes became thieves and attacked people, simply in order to survive. Moreover, the time was one of outlawry and both travel and walks on the road were extremely dangerous activities. This is partly why many historians describe the antebellum South as a very violent place and also why southerners in the nineteenth century considered African American as dangerous people and believed cohabitation with them would be impossible (and unthinkable) without slavery because if they were free, they rebel against white people. This episode which mattered little in comparison with more significant events is therefore a proof of the difficult and dangerous condition of African American in the antebellum South, were they slaves working on a plantation, runaway slaves, or even free blacks.

This was the status of the Augusta jail one day after the attempted raid upon its confines by an angry mob of white men. The mob of 500 armed men had been intent on having their justice with William Robinson, an African American man accused of robbing and attempting to assault a white woman, Mrs. Minnie Walker. Hot with anger, the party of men assembled and then proceeded to storm the local jail last night at about one in the morning. The twenty policemen assigned to guard the jail refused the request for Robinson and defended the jail to the best of their ability. While they were successful in barring entry of the mob and the capture of Robinson, two of the police's corps fell in battle with the mob. As a precaution for possible repeat raids, the jail requested additional backup forces for the next few days and nights as courts tried Robinson. Ironically, several of the soldiers posted to guard the prison were apart of the lynching mob the previous night. In an effort to protect Robinson until proven guilty, the court system agreed to speed up the trial's start date. The grand jury assured the city populace that they would indict Robinson; however, the specific fate of the man was not as concrete. Normally, the courts reserved the death penalty for those who actually committed the act, but there was the slim possibility that that they might sentence Robinson to the death penalty based solely on intent. ","The fate of William Robinson is unknown. Did he receive a fair trial? Was he sentenced to death? Were the efforts of an impassioned lynch mob more successful a few days later when the soldiers returned to their normal stations? The Atlanta Constitution failed to provide a follow-up story in the weeks to come. However, one can hazard a guess as to the likely gruesome outcome of Robinson. If mobs did not seize him while he was in jail awaiting trial, there were plenty of opportunities to arrest the man and enact vigilante justice later on. In Georgia, lynching reached horrific heights from 1891-1899. Though Governor Candler agreed to send troops to protect Robinson and the guards of the jail in 1898, he cannot boast a consistent record, for just a year later, he failed to prevent the torrent of brutal lynchings which spread throughout Georgia. ","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans. In the Reconstruction Era South, lynching of African Americans was used, especially by the Ku Klux Klan, as a tool for reversing the social changes and enfranchisement of African Americans under Federal occupation. This type of racially-motivated lynching continued in the Jim Crow Era as a means of enforcing subservience and preventing economic competition. Although lynchings did occur prior to 1880, radical racism and mob violence peaked during the 1890's in a surge of terrorism that did not dissipate until well into the twentieth-century. Racism and popular mythology of the time created the image of the hyper-sexualized African American male who would rape pure and noble white women like Minnie Walker; however, historians find that in 80% of the cases, there were no sexual charges alleged, let alone proven. Lynch mobs assembled for petty offenses too. Stealing a cow, arguing with a white man, or attempting to register to vote were reason enough for many African Americans to hang in the eyes of the white South. The absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by every single individual in the South, but its pervasiveness throughout the region is telling of the fierce supremacist mentality which reached its height in Georgia in the 1890's.","<em>~ Colleen Elizabeth Laurence</em>"],"display_date":"November 3, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-03","locations":[{"id":2194,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3229,"title":"Seizure of Martin Joson&#39;s Property\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-05-17","end_date":"1877-05-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the years following the Civil War many Southerners faced economic hardships, and Martin Joson was no exception.

The writ allowed the sheriff to seize Joson's property, including an improved lot on 2nd Street and a store on Grant Street in the City of Natchitones. The writ allowed him three days to come up with the judgment of the writ along with the costs owed before his property would be sold.","Fi Fa is an abbreviation for Fieri facias a Latin term meaning that you cause to be done. The writ is one of execution of judgment, allowing the sheriff or other officer to take action against the debtor, which in this case was Joson. With the writ, a sheriff can seize as much property as needed to settle the monetary judgment owed. The judgment had usually been settled earlier in court. A writ of Fi Fa does provide for the recovery of the property, as shown by the three days Joson is given before his property is sold, which would usually occur in auction.","Joson was not the only African American to own property within city limits. A noticeable amount of other African Americans were able to achieve the same thing during the postbellum period. Joson, however, had been free before the emancipation of slaves after the Civil War, which gave him a background that better enabled him to own property than most former slaves. The postbellum period was not without economic hardships for previously freedmen, as shown by Joson's economic misfortune, and the previously free African Americans felt threatened by the mass of newly freed former slaves just as white southerners did. The large population of newly freed African Americans created political and economic competition in a time when the economy and political arena were already far from stable."],"display_date":"May 17, 1877","search_date":"1877-05-17","locations":[{"id":5591,"lat":31.7501863608,"lng":-93.1333207953,"zoom":8,"place":"NATCHITOCHES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3233,"title":"Runaway Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-01-27","end_date":"1827-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The harshness of the institution of slavery is something that historians can agree on. The lifestyle that enslaved people had to endure is one that many cannot imagine today. It is not surprising therefore when slaves wished to be free of their masters and escape from plantations. The reasons for slaves running away varied but usually included fear of punishment or resentment because of punishment already administered, avoiding the harsh labor forced upon them, as well as sheer cruelty imposed by their masters. Although the great mass of Louisiana slaves remained at home, the number of runaway slaves in the state compelled the legislature to act. In an attempt to centralize the problem of runaway slaves, the Louisiana State legislature created acts in the 1820s and 1830s to set up central depots to which runaways, unclaimed for two months or longer, were to be transported. These depots kept the slaves together and used them on public works. Jailors were required to advertise the runaway slaves they kept in their prisons to successfully return them to owners. These jailors would be paid upong the death of a slave for expenses incurred with regard to the deceased.","Although Louisiana attempted to produce an efficient system to recover runaway slaves, it did not always function as intended. The legislature created several more parish depots in the late 1820s and this decentralized the effort to keep the runaway slaves in central locations such as Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Slaveholders took it upon themselves to advertise to the community the loss of a slave and incurred the expenses themselves. Plantation owners paid large sums of money to advertise slaves' looks and ages in the hope of their property being returned. One such advertisement ran in the newspaper, <em>Le Courrier de la Louisiane</em>, advertising the loss of three slaves to a subscriber. The subscriber offered a handsome reward to anyone that helped return Lewis, Isaac, and Snaiel to his fields. Judging from their descriptions, these slaves were very important slaves to their owner. Three strong young men missing from the plantation deprived the owner of not only labor bu capital and time. The January advertisement volunteered the information that one of the slaves had been missing since September, demonstrating the long time period a plantation owner could spend searching for runaway slaves. It it not certain if Lewis, Isaac, and Daniel ever returned to their owner. Runaway slaves cost their masters' time, money and a loss of control over a system that the economy of the antebellum Louisiana was based upon. The state believed that the situation of runaway slaves was grave enough to address it in their laws to gain a grasp on the problem. When this failed, the slaveholders turned to the resources of newspaper advertisements. The advertisements from newspapers in the South serve as reminders of the lengths that plantation owenrs would go to in order to insure the safe return of their chattel."],"display_date":"January 27, 1827","search_date":"1827-01-27","locations":[{"id":5659,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3239,"title":"The Foundation of Tennessee Colonization Society and the First Freed Slaves to Leave Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-12-01","end_date":"1829-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In December 1829, Josiah F.

Polk and Lindsey's society was a branch of the American Colonization Society whose goal was to repatriate free slaves to Liberia in Africa. They started to try to convince free slaves to leave the United States as soon as the Society was created in 1829. If the slaves were not free, members of the Society met their owners and persuaded them to free their slaves and let them go to Africa. However, it was a difficult job and they did not really succeed; the society was not really efficient at the beginning (only 55 freed slaves from Tennessee went to Liberia before 1841).","Even if it was not a success at first, the creation of such an organization was significant for Nashville and for Tennessee. What should they do? Nobody agreed. Some wanted to abolish slavery; other said it was not possible. Sending freed slaves back to America apparently was a good solution for the people who believed freed slaves would not manage to leave in peace with other white Americans. However, Tennesseans were as idealistic as other Americans and they really believed it could work which means that, in spite of the great number of slaves in Tennessee, people were not aware that these slaves were often born in the United States and would like independency but on the American continent, although some of them volunteered to leave. For example, the African American newspaper Freedom's Journal, wrote about a colored minister who wrote he was ready, with his whole family but also a bit anxious to proceed. So, even people who asked for the freedom of the slaves did not really considered themselves as equals to American citizens and it was a kind of blackmail: We will free our slaves if we are sure they will not stay here."],"display_date":"December 1829","search_date":"1829-12-16","locations":[{"id":11950,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3240,"title":"A Reporters Response to Frederick Douglass\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-07","end_date":"1895-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 7, 1895 an African American reporter wrote quite a compelling article in New South, a local black newspaper in Beaufort, South Carolina.

The author explained the many hardships and troubles this black youth experienced throughout his life. As the boy grew older he learned to read and write by teaching himself. In the man's later years, he would become a great political figure and a spokesperson for African Americans throughout the United States. The author then revealed that the man referred to in the article was Frederick Douglass. The article ended with a quote from Douglass that stated that all colored people had opportunities they must capitalize on and if a person remained in ignorance then there was no chance of survival.

An agent roused Culberth from his work to pick up a package which he eventually discovered was full of alcohol Believing it to be the gift of some kind person, Culberth and his friends immediately set forth consuming the package's contents and were in a bawdy state when they finally discovered that their secret supplier was none other than Culbreth's boss. Of course, Culbreth's boss did not intend for the alcohol to reach Culbreth and his comrades. Rather, the boss had a dependency on whisky which he could only assuage by sneaking alcohol into the dry county through the mail. Alas, Culbreth's boss had to endure a few days without his precious whiskey, but he certainly learned his lesson. Upon discovering Culbreth and his friends, The boss took one long sad look at them, and then remarked, 'Well, the next time I want any whisky you may bet your last dollar I will order it in my own name.'  ","As both Jake Culbreth and his boss discovered, there were ways around the local temperance restrictions. Whether through mail, secretive moonshine operations, or go-betweens, individuals founds avenues to satisfy their habit when the drums of temperance began to beat. Though many Americans subscribed to the temperance movement and its ideals, there were plenty of others like Culbreth's boss who simply could not resist. The degree to which they kept this habit secret varied. For example, Culbreth's boss was admittedly ashamed of his indulgence and did not want his neighbors to know, hence, the secret packages. However, there were many other individuals who didn't care at all and flagrantly disobeyed local dictates and societal pressure. An organized temperance movement began in Georgia in the late 1820's and, after early difficulties, flourished through the 1930's. ","Georgia's temperance movement began much as it did in other parts of the United States. Recruiting many in its ranks from the evangelical Protestant population, the temperance movement condemned alcoholic beverages as harmful or even sinful for the individual and society as a whole. In their minds, drinking destroyed families and reputations and fostered poverty, disorder, and crime. Perhaps the mistake between Jake Culbreth and his boss was dismissed by both parties; however, this cannot be said to be the case for all African Americans during the temperance movement. ","After the Civil War, the temperance movement had an odd relationship with racism. White Georgians resisted any mixing of the races in temperance organizations but were eager to make it illegal for emancipated African Americans to drink. The desire to further disenfranchise African Americans as well as the fear of possible criminal activity from them drove white Georgians' desire to impose restrictions. Originally, Georgia's temperance reformers stressed voluntary participation in prohibition, but they later expanded their campaign platform to change the laws to restrict and abolish the sale of alcoholic beverages. This mandatory statewide prohibition in Georgia lasted from 1908 until 1935, a period which substantially extended beyond the national prohibition (1920-1933) in both its starting date and end.

The structure of society was changing around them, and many had trouble with the rising stature of blacks in society, even when it came to matters of national security. Raleigh Green, in a June 10, 1898 editorial, expressed his particular aggravation that white southern men were expected to salute African American officers. While Green recognized that all blacks were free, he continued to accept a central principle of slavery: blacks are inferior to whites. Green explained that respect for black officers was causing a great deal of unnecessary discussion with Spain. Green argued that any black officer who expected a southern white solder to salute him would be consistently disappointed. To solve this foolishness, Green explained that any black soldier who did not want to fight in the Spanish American war should go home. Green bluntly stated that black soldiers were vestigial to the American military; the American military did not need their services. He concluded his editorial by saying of qualified black soldiers, however we are glad to be able to express it as an opinion that such colored men here in the south are few and far between.","Racial tension in America was so strong it played a role in the Spanish-American war. When the Maine was sunk in 1898, President William McKinley was forced to move the nation into war. Some blacks saw this as an opportunity to advance their social position. Booker T. Washington proclaimed himself willing to take responsibility for recruiting soldiers who would gladly fight on behalf of the United States. Not all blacks saw war as a positive force. Some argued that the war was only arming the very people that abused African Americans. Others considered it ironic that blacks were fighting for the freedom of Cubans when blacks endured obstacles to their own freedom at home. Furthermore, some worried that the Spanish American war would serve as a distraction from these injustices. ","Although, Green told those blacks who didn't want to fight to go home, this was not a viable option. As Edward Ayers explains, any soldier who had been enlisted in the military long before 1898 had no choice but to fight in Cuba. Although many of these troops were courageous soldiers, they received little recognition. One sergeant explained it mattered not if we were soldiers of the United States, we were 'niggers' as they call us and they treated us with contempt. Many white citizens and newspapers made it clear that any black soldier stationed in their area would be expected to stay in their place. Blacks, however, were also clear that they demanded equality. In the end, however, Ayers concludes that the experience of the Spanish-American war, far from helping race relations in America, accelerated their decline.

Thus wrote the Chattanooga Times in reference to the lynching of an African American male in Georgia's Schley County Tuesday, February 12, 1889. Thousands of individuals gathered to participate in the brutal death of Blackman. Apparently, the Georgia Press vehemently condemned the actions of the lynch mob prompting the Chattanooga author to pen that such morbid anxiety to see a fellow creature strangled ought not to be allowed to again manifest itself in Georgia. The legislature should pass a law making executions private; and if they were to adopt the plan of executing all capital criminal within the walls of the penitentiary, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., that would be a still further improvement. Public hangings are a disgrace to civilization.","With a story like the one above in which every citizen of Schley County seemed to participate in the lynching of Blackman, it is difficult to conceive of anti-lynching campaigns. And yet the absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by everyone in the South. As the uproar by the Georgia press and the vehement opposition by the Chattanooga Times author demonstrates, opposition to lynching was a salient force. Despite the dangers of vocalizing an anti-lynching message, the movement grew from 1890 onward. Among the opposition, African American women were among the first to speak out. After all, it was often their husbands, brothers, sons, and friends who were wrongfully accused and lynched. Over time this assembly of African American women began to call upon their white counterparts to control the violence and lawlessness of white men. Unfortunately, their pleas and demands for intervention did not achieve fruition for several decades to come.","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans. In the Reconstruction Era South, lynching of African Americans was used, especially by the Ku Klux Klan, as a tool for reversing the social changes and enfranchisement of African Americans under Federal occupation. This type of racially-motivated lynching continued in the Jim Crow Era as a means of enforcing subservience and preventing economic competition. Although lynchings did occur prior to 1880, radical racism and mob violence peaked during the 1890's in a surge of terrorism that did not dissipate until well into the twentieth-century. It is unknown what crime Blackman committed. Regardless he certainly did not deserve the gross and inhumane treatment which befell him. Lynch mobs assembled for both large and petty offenses alike. A lynch mob treated the rape of a woman the same as stealing a cow, arguing with a white man, or attempting to register to vote.

Fifteen hundred people attended the evening church service to hear the sermon given by Love. Love noted that the outrageous acts of lynching would not stop any time soon. Love professed that the best way to decrease occurrences of rape was to depend on the laws set forth in this country. He promoted the idea that all blacks should follow the law in order to dispel any preconceived notions that whites had concerning black people.

At the end of the meeting the church as a whole took a vote and concluded that they endorsed Love's position as the overall position of the church. ","The threat of being hung from a noose scared many southern African Americans after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. Black southerners were hanged for any reason that whites determined to be a necessary cause such as the supposed killing of a white person or the raping of a white woman. Yet the hanging of a black person was not the only form of mob violence African Americans experienced. In 1899 in Palmetto, Georgia two thousand white men, women and children gathered to watch the lynching of Sam Hose who allegedly raped a white woman. The innocent black man was burned alive and his body parts were divided and sold as souvenirs. This tragic episode and many others occurred frequently throughout the South. The horrors associated with lynching and mob violence were at the center of Love's sermon. ","As the population of the United States increased at a rapid rate, whites and blacks began to live in close vicinity to one another in urban and rural areas. One result of the living situation in the rapidly growing United States included a fairly high frequency of lynching. The horrors of lynching became a topic of concern for both whites and blacks. The sermon given by Love denoted the importance of the issue of lynching throughout the South.

For two whole months, with the siege of Petersburg in the backdrop, the House mulled over the condition of the state and the Confederacy in its fifth year of independence. On the second day of session, Mississippi Governor Charles Clark gave a speech on the Condition of the Country, in which he encouraged the state to stand with the Confederacy until the very end. "," An attitude of defiance marks the words of the governor as he rallied the House not to give in to any entreaties of peace or negotiation offered by the Federal Government. Clark encouraged the state to stand resilient against their foe as they fought a righteous war to preserve the Christian institution of slavery. I recommend that you solemnly and firmly declare that Mississippi will be true to her plighted faith to her sister Confederates, and will conquer or perish with them....rather than abandon our cherished and Christian institution of domestic slavery, we will send our servants with our sons to the battlefield, to fight for our right to protect and guard them against their worst enemies. "," It is the institution of slavery that so strongly strikes a chord with Clark and the citizens of the South. Economic and social circumstances of the day and age encouraged the view that the institution of slavery was perfectly acceptable and necessary for the established structure of southern society. Southerners believed slavery to be a perfectly righteous and Godly institution, in which they acted as the paternal master over their misguided slaves. It economically benefited the white man while allowing blacks to be cared for and introduced to the Gospel. The Confederacy felt it better to fight until the death rather than to allow their benevolent way of life to be stripped away from them.

To create greater distance between the two, the Virginia state government decided to segregate railroad cars based on race. In 1900, the state of Virginia passed a law that mandated all railroad companies to furnish separate coaches for the transportation of white and blacks passengers. The law required that there be no difference in the quality, conveniences, and accommodations in the cars. The law further stated that passengers who refused to occupy their assigned car could be removed from the train. The law was met with great approval in many places including Alexandria, Virginia, and, in general, faced very little opposition. In Alexandria, whether the law would pass was not an issue. According to The Washington Post, Senator Mushbach and Delegate Bendheim, of this city (Alexandria), have not expressed themselves upon the subject but there is little doubt that both will vote for the measure when it comes up. Race segregation was a welcome institution in a region still nursing its wounds after the Civil War. ","The segregation of railroads was part of the development of the Jim Crow South. The railroad car law in 1900 was the first official law mandating segregation on trains. For thirty years after the Civil War, blacks and whites rode in the same railroad cars. Segregation, however, was not unprecedented. Charles Wynes explained that whites would force blacks to sit in the smoking car or a special car, although he conceded this behavior was erratic. The cause for such laws is unclear. It is clear that the laws were not a result of demanded segregation by whites. Instead, the laws were a result of the underlying racial bigotry that existed. The establishment of Virginia's first law encouraged the implementation of more. In 1904 railroad segregation laws were further tightened. Blacks had to bear the indignity of exclusion. They were often surrounded by curtains to keep the feeling of their presence minimal and were forced to give up a seat to a desiring white person. Blacks had little recourse and could only try futilely to get the laws repealed."],"display_date":"December 11, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-11","locations":[{"id":14385,"lat":38.8682751435,"lng":-77.0932794538,"zoom":11,"place":"Alexandria City, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3276,"title":"Land Trade for more Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-08-25","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Texas land was ideal for slaveholders.

Although slavery arrived late to Texas, it soon became as powerful as an institution as elsewhere in the South.

Samuel Andrews created a notice on behalf of his brother living in Texas. His brother, John, was interested in having slaves sent to Texas for a few years to furnish the land. At this time, plantations and small farms were expanding rapidly throughout the state, and his brother, John, most likely saw this as a great opportunity.

(Titus 1:5). Reverend William Troy, of Richmond, preached a powerful sermon, centered on this biblical passage, as he installed the Rev. E C Thomson as the new pastor of the Mangohick Baptist Church in King William County. Thomson, who had attended the Richmond Theological Seminary and had formerly been ordained as pastor of the Jericho Baptist Church in Caroline County, faced a new congregation eager to accept him into their ranks. Not only were the members of the church hopeful that Thomson would bring growth, but the Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, also had great aspirations for him. The Planet called Thomson a good preacher and [he] belongs to the forward rank of those who are working for the improvement of our race. Perhaps nervous facing such a new opportunity coupled with such responsibility, he nonetheless delivered his first heartwarming message, leaving the congregation optimistic that he would, indeed, encourage progress. "," Travelers to the South described it as the most simply and sincerely religious country, where religion is a very large factor in life, and God is very real and personal; this reputation seems to have stuck throughout its history. Religious fervor would very prominently emerge in the 1880's as a wave of evangelicalism swept the South, increasing the numbers of converts and regular revival meetings. Baptists and Methodists were the most successful Protestant denominations in the postwar South, gaining large amounts of new members and building new churches. Thus, the appearance of local church news in a major newspaper remained not uncommon, as communities truly cared about such issues. Still, circumstances were not always favorable towards ministers. Due to ever-present troubles like finances and latent apathy, running a church became a hard task. Especially in rural churches like Mangohick Baptist, pastoral turnover could be high. "," Blacks, especially, flocked to new congregations after emancipation, though usually they sought out all-black churches, with white churches more than willing to let allow this voluntary segregation. Most often attracted to the Baptist denomination, black Christians regarded their church as a central institution in their lives and their minister as, a community leader. This development distinguished black pastors from their white counterparts, and also laid on them the extra challenge of being political and negotiating the desire of their congregations for autonomy...the demands of young assertive blacks and the caution of more conservative blacks. Evident in the Planet's portrayal of Thomson's new role, lies the idea that he must be a leader in helping blacks ameliorate their lives in a society aimed at filtering out their presence. How the new pastor would handle such pressure remained to be seen, but clearly he encountered obligations that a white congregation would not necessarily expect.

The citizens of Bossier parish were indignant at the crime. The paper also noted with no surprise that they created a plan to capture Hutchins when he was being transferred between prisons at Shreveport and Bellevue in order to perform their own justice with the criminal. The transfer was to take place on May 12 through 13 and the group that conducted the prison transfer consisted of two deputy sheriffs and a group of 12 citizens including the Chief of Police, E.M. Austin. Hutchins rode in a wagon with one of the citizens, Chas. A. Dewing. Everyone except Hutchins was armed. The group met 75-100 masked men about four miles from town. When Hutchins saw them he tried to get Dewing's pistol, but Dewing kept it from him as Austin, the Chief of Police, put himself in between the wagon and the crowd. Austin attempted to get the crowd to lower their guns, while Hutchins begged the crowd to shoot him. The crowd refused both Austin's and Hutchins' requests, and yelled back their intention to hang Hutchins. With this threat Hutchins pulled a four-inch blade from his pocket and began to stab himself to try and save himself from hanging. Austin and Dewing got the knife away from Hutchins and the crowd took Hutchins, who had begun to lose large quantities of blood, away from the wagon and to a nearby tree. The crowd hung Hutchins from the tree, even though he was already dying from his self-inflicted wounds.","The most telling part of this episode is the opening line of the article: The lynching of D.C. Hutchins...was accompanied with more than the usual dramatic surroundings of such events. This article, which was published in a national newspaper, used the word usual to describe the death of an African American without trial. Lynchings became increasingly popular in the cotton uplands, and especially in rural places such as Bossier Parish. Counties or parishes with few towns, low rural population density, and poor law enforcement had high rates of lynching, especially as the African American population increased. The lynching of African Americans reached its highest point when new African Americans came to the uplands and were strangers to the community. Men like Hutchins had no one within the community to support them, allowing reputations as desperados to spring up. These reputations were also due to the white belief that African American crime was out of control and a serious threat. The paper describes Hutchins as a villain, while portraying the lynching mob as the decent citizens of Bossier parish.

However, each year many divorce petitions were filed in the South. In 1857, Mrs. Charlotte Smith of Lowndes County, Mississippi stated that she caught her husband committing adultery with a negro girl named Nancy in April of that year. Mrs. Smith, devastated by her husband's crime, filed for divorce, alimony, and the custody of their daughter. "," It is difficult to tell how much of Mrs. Smith's initiative to file the petition was due to the concept of interracial adultery or just due to the simple unfaithfulness of her husband. No doubt race played some sort of role, since southern plantation society was built on a social hierarchy of fuel by racial relations. However, it seems that indicating the race of the third party would not have much affected Mrs. Smith's case. The accusation was more about the act itself rather than the individuals involved.

Williams was a convict who escaped while under lease to a family and working on the Noxubee river levee. The Governor of Mississippi offered 50 dollars for someone to arrest and take Williams to the state penitentiary. The description of the man at large was listed. Along with including his height and age, the paper made a special note that Williams was a mulatto with black hair and was pitted by smallpox. "," Most wanted ads during this time were for missing black convicts. The idea of leasing out convicts came about in the South in the years following the Civil War. Leasing convicts meant that black convicts would have to work the land of a public area or be bound to a white plantation owner who, in exchange for the labor, would pay for the convict?s fines. This idea of leasing convicts became more widespread after the war and gave ex-slave owners a new form of cheap labor to make up for the labor force they lost after the emancipation. Convict leasing also provided the states with a readily available supply of laborers to help build up the railways along with other domestic necessities. "," The high number of black convicts was largely the result of the unfair court systems in the South. Most officers, judges, and even the jurors were predominately white and showed little mercy to black offenders. Yet, most blacks tried to turn to other options to avoid dealing with the court systems of the South. The Freedman?s Bureau was a popular alternative to the unjust systems because in normal trials, blacks did not receive a fair trial. The Freedman?s Bureau was called upon by black defendants to attempt to give them a hearing to try to settle their various disputes with other blacks and, in some cases, disputes with whites. "," In addition to unfair trials, southern laws concerning blacks were also extremely harsh, making it easier to get blacks in prisons to be leased out. Arson became a capital offense, stealing from someone?s home caused the offender to go to prison for life, and the theft of livestock became grand larceny. This increase in severity in the punishments in the south gave railroad, lumber, and mining companies a great opportunity to have access to this type of free labor. The large proportion of the convicts were blacks who had been charged for relatively trivial crimes.

M. Todd came to his new district, he heard threats that the white men in the area had a way of getting rid of men who came from the North to preach to the colored people. Todd may or may not have taken the threat seriously. Regardless, he worked with his superior Reverend I. G. Pollard to organize services that were open to mixed congregations. It was after such a service on March 26, 1879 that Todd and Pollard found themselves being held at gunpoint by the marshal and another man. The marshal had begun to direct the two into a back billiard room when Todd, overcome with panic, broke away and ran. The marshal reportedly shot him at least three times, before turning his attention to Pollard. The marshal stripped and searched Pollard in the back room, though he claimed that his main objective was Todd. Once Todd turned himself in later that night and had undergone a similar search, the marshal released the two preachers. Pollard took Todd to a doctor who saw to his wounds, however, the paper in which this story appeared never specified how serious these injuries were. The paper did relate that after that night Pollard took Todd into the country, probably to be kept out of harm's way. Todd, however, decided to send his brother to Little Rock, and weeks later he accompanied him to Brinkley. Todd and his brother were waiting in Brinkley for the train to Little Rock, when they saw multiple masked faces waiting outside of their hotel. Todd was able to escape on foot to a train station nine miles from Brinkley but he died from his wounds upon reaching Little Rock on April 23.","This episode reveals the increased racist sentiment in the South after Reconstruction. Racism became more and more evident as segregation began to spread into many different areas of everyday life. Churches had been biracial before the Civil War but some had become segregated before the Civil War, and racist sentiments obviously flared at Todd's attempt to intermingle the two races, even though they already shared a common faith. These strong and violent racial beliefs would result in even more attacks and cases of lynching as segregation continued to escalate. Todd's death showed this problem on a national level when the story was published in a New York newspaper, and yet the situation remained unchanged until the Civil Rights Movement. ","Todd's work with African Americans in the church draws attention to the increased involvement of African Americans in the church in the postbellum period, as well as the growth of the Methodist Church. Many African Americans turned to the church because they were able to fulfill leadership positions that were unavailable to them outside of it. The church became a way for African Americans to celebrate their new freedom that was being curtailed in many other areas of their lives.

Once organized, they forced their way through the barricaded doors of Pier 2. Now inside the docks, they struck out at the scabs, filling their jobs, and ravaged the offices, where they stole a barrel of whiskey. The effects of their new capture only further soured their demeanor, and resulted in them acting like demons. The dockhands' violence emerged as the culmination of a strike, led by a man named Kelly, a member of the Knights of Labor. Effectively organized, the workers had gone on strike for higher wages, but had received no promise from the Company's agent, Col. Bremond, who claimed to lack the proper wage authority. This disappointment prompted the reckless decision to break into the pier, and subsequently, a Warwick County judge's call for five companies of armed troops. The military unit, of both white and black companies, quickly restored order and forced the rioters to disassemble. Accepting failure, many of the dockhands hoped to eventually to return to work for the railroad company. "," The Knights of Labor emerged in the early 1880's in response to the Industrial Revolution, opposing the increasing trend of concentrated corporate power and monopoly in American business. Though more popular in the North (Kelly hailed from New York), union leaders did travel throughout the South, organizing whites and blacks, and men and women. By 1886, the Knights could claim over 50,000 members, spread out over 10 Southern states. This particular strike resembled typical labor disputes led by the Knights, in that they usually demanded a combination of better wages, better working conditions, or shorter workdays. In fact, the Newport News strike existed as one of twenty-two different strikes by the Southern Knights during that decade, but like Newport News, few affected any measure of change."," Very unique to the Knights of Labor, blacks and whites were treated as equals, despite most leadership still remaining white. Yet, compared to other Gilded Age organizations, such as the Farmer's Alliance, the Knights appeared remarkably interracial. Blacks of the Farmer's Alliance would actually comment on the differences when the two unions formed a tenuous alliance in 1889. An Era of Good Feelings existed for the black and white workingmen in the organization, as interracial solidarity and democratic idealism were fearlessly proclaimed. Sadly, this feature contributed to the union's downfall, as newspapers, across the country, attacked the group for blurring the color line. Coupled with failed strikes and uncooperative economic conditions, by the turn of the century, the Knights had faded out of sight. In their place, though, would emerge the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and its leader, Samuel Gompers. Hoping to organize resistance to affect the same types of changes, this union chose to exclude blacks, preferring that they form their own organization.

She was confronted with afflictions that face modern brides: finances for the wedding, leaving her family and the house she loved, and creating a home for her future husband with their very limited resources. Ms. Holladay wanted to prove her strength to her family and friends who believed her to be weak, and her solution was to have a happy marriage and a happy home.

Diaries from the time are full of hopes for the future, but it turned out that life for women on plantations was not easy. White women were essentially isolated. Mary Kendall, a Northerner living with her new husband in the South, wrote to her sister to describe the feelings of loneliness. While slave-owning men were businessmen and often traveled for trade, their wives were left to run the plantations. Kendall wrote that she had recently gone three weeks without seeing another white woman. This was not the case for all Southern women. According to a census from 1810-1860 in Virginia and the Carolinas, 35% of families were made up of two parents and children, whereas 41% of families consisted of extended family as well. After marriage, Mary Jane Holladay Thompson lived with her husband, her daughter, and her uncle-in-law, whom she found insufferable. Even so, she tolerated him for her husband's sake.","White women lived in close proximity to slave women, but lives of the two were very different. Black women on plantations did not often see their husbands, fathers, and sons in positions of power, and in turn were more equal to their men than were white women. According to Fox-Genovese, like wives of plantation owners, slave women also dealt with isolation; they were in a constant battle against the institution of slavery that bound them to a life without basic human liberties.

Citizens, civic societies, and the military convened in the streets as the festivities began. Two prominent leaders in Savannah offered the prayer and proclamation for the meeting. The orator for the day, Rev. Emmanuel K. Love gave a compelling speech to all of those in attendance. Love noted that the Emancipation Proclamation initiated the African American's fight for true freedom and was truly a great event in black history. He also indicated the shortcomings of the Emancipation Proclamation as the blacks gained no honor, fame, wealth, or civil rights through the Emancipation Proclamation. Love recognized that the anniversary was important, but blacks still had to earn their place in white American society. Although Love called for equality among the people of the United States, he announced his stance that whites and blacks should remain separate. In his speech, Love pushed for initial individual black greatness that would then lead the race to become great as a whole. Love promoted his idea that blacks were only what they made themselves. After Love's speech ended the celebration continued and culminated with a grand parade from the military.","Freedom celebrations became a large part of African American culture and included many other activities such as athletic events and beauty contests which exemplified the greatness of the African American race.

By the next day he was dead. ","The relationship between slave and owner teetered on a precarious balance. On one hand slaveholders reveled in their slaves' dependence and love for them. According to Raymond and Alice Bauer, masters saw their slaves' smiling, bowing, and scraping as evidence of their happiness, docility, and acceptance as part of an inferior race. On the other hand, slaves frustrated their masters with feigned illness and pregnancy, broken tools, and running away for short stints to avoid work. This laziness was punished through whippings and other humiliating practices. Slaves resisted day to day in these subtle ways, confusing and provoking their masters. ","Physical slave violence and insurrection were much rarer than these more passive forms of resistance. Attacks like the one against Mrs. Smith did not occur frequently. Melvin Ely writes that the wake of Nat Turner's rebellion in Virginia in 1831 revealed not a militarized culture of bold, well-armed, dead-eye marksmen born on horseback, but rather a land of frightened, often befuddled white men milling around in ragtag militia musters. They were unprepared for a slave revolt, and were often without the proper supplies to put down an attack should it happen.

At the Pond plantation the horses had been hidden in the woods once it was learned that Union forces were close by. But when the foraging party arrived, the family's slaves led the Union troops to the exact spot where the horses were located, sparing no loyalty to their master. The troops did not stop there. They raided the main house and the smokehouse and took everything of value, especially making sure not to leave any alcohol untouched.

"," However, the incident went a long way towards changing some Southerners' perceptions of northern Union soldiers.

Slaves, being the property of their masters, couldn't just freely marry at their heart's desire. There was a standard protocol. In his biographical narrative, Allen Parker recounted how the process would likely unfold on a plantation in Chowan County, North Carolina. If a male slave wanted to marry a woman from another plantation, he first had to obtain the permission of the girl herself. Then, he would ask for consent from his own masters. If they approved, he would then travel to the girl's plantation and approach her owner. The conversation would go something like: Hello Sam Is that you? <em>Yes Massa, its me... </em>Sam, what message did your Master send by you? <em>Did'nt send no message, sar, I comed myself.</em> What You don't mean to say that you have run away Sam? <em>No sar, Massa told me as how I might come and see Massa Jones. </em>Well Sam, what is it, does your Master intend to hire you out next year and you want me to hire you? <em>No sar, Massa John don't let his niggers, he wants me hisself.

Then, he would prolong the matter: Well Sam, I like your looks, and I will think it over. You come and see me next week and I will tell you. <em>Can I see Sue, Massa? </em>Yes Sam, you can see her when she comes from the field. After spending some time with his sweetheart and waiting a week, the slave would then return to the owner: Hello Sam, you here again, what do you want this time? <em>Well Massa Jones, I comed to see as to what you thought about me and Sue getting married. </em>Get out you nigger. <em>But Massa told Sam to come. </em>How's that Sam? <em>Massa Jones told Sam to come in one week, and den Massa Jones tell Sam as how he can marry Sue or not. </em>O yes, I remember now, well Sam I have talked it over with Sue's Mistress and we have concluded to let you marry Sue, and I will have a cabin built down by the quarters and Sue can live there. <em>Thankie Massa.","</em>","African Americans strove to establish meaningful family relations under slavery. There was a strong desire for social space between slave and master, as Emily West notes in <em>Chains of Love</em>. Though slave marriages were not legally recognized under traditional white law, developing meaningful relationships that existed independent of white authority represented a means of resistance against oppression. These relationships also pointed out the gender differences among slaves, the male being expected to initiate romantic contact. Allen Parker recalled how his father would regularly walk ten miles in the middle of the night to see his wife and his family. Slave families often had to struggle to remain together as evidenced in Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Enslaved persons would often manipulate the paternalist sympathies of their owners, reminding them that filial bonds of slaves were just as powerful as those for whites."],"display_date":1852,"search_date":"1852-07-01","locations":[{"id":9345,"lat":36.285880348,"lng":-76.6866587179,"zoom":10,"place":"CHOWAN, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3331,"title":"African American Religious Services\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-09-18","end_date":"1868-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In one edition of the <em>Page Valley Courier Newspaper</em> a reader asserts that The African Baptist Church is larger than any other Baptist church other than on in England.

Mary Wightman Helm had good reason to rejoice after a most difficult journey to Texas. Helm related that the trip usually took a bearable seven days, but left without a breeze in the unpredictable Gulf of Mexico, her voyage took an astonishing 31 days. The ship only carried provisions for the expected seven days and was insufficiently stocked with water. It is no surprise that under these conditions Helm fell ill. She related, after our cooked provisions had given out, crackers and hard sea bread sustained life; but when the water gave out, then real suffering commenced. ","Helm had already survived extensive travels before she boarded the Little Zoe, the schooner that took her and her husband Elias R. Wightman to Texas. The couple departed Herkimer County, New York in 1828 and set out upon a popular route to the West. They traveled by boat down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the boarded a steamboat bound for New Orleans by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. At New Orleans, the Helms embarked upon their troubled cruise on the Little Zoe. At the time, such schooners were the primary means of travel between New Orleans and Texas because their shallow bottoms were less likely to hit the sandbars that existed along the coast of Texas. The small ships, however, were subject to the fickle weather of the Gulf of Mexico. ","Though the Helms found their voyage particularly unpleasant, it pales in comparison to the horrific passage of slaves brought from Africa to the American South. The South's economy created a great demand for slaves that fueled the trans-Atlantic slave trade even after it became illegal in America in 1808. Like Mary Helm, enslaved Africans faced hunger and sickness but also bore the added burden of generally inhumane conditions on the journey to America. Sources describe the system of transportation as gruesome and ruthlessly efficient. Such factors as malnutrition... and deprivation of sunlight from prolonged stays below deck made illness and high death rates unavoidable. And though the trade was outlawed by the United States in 1808, the illegal trade that continued through portals such as Texas brought about unprecedented horrors for captured Africans. Though most of the slaves in Texas were brought from the United States an illegal [trans-Atlantic] slave trade developed as early as 1835. The injustices that took place on slave ships occurred on the seas rather than American soil, but the blood shed on such vessels belonged on the plantations of the South. The demand for slaves created by Texas and the other Southern states led directly to the brutalities against Africans. As one source summarizes, Without the demand for slaves, there would have been no transatlantic slave trade... no illegal piracy along the coast-but, most of all, none of the terror and degradation suffered by slaves on their journey from the coast of Africa to the Americas."],"display_date":"January 27, 1829","search_date":"1829-01-27","locations":[{"id":15201,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3354,"title":"Black Leaders Hold Convention in Macon\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-25","end_date":"1888-01-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning at 10:00 AM on January 25, 1888 and continuing through the next day, at least 350 black Georgian men met at the Cotton Avenue Baptist Church in Macon, Georgia to determine the wise course of future action, for the promotion of the race's welfare. The men divided themselves into committees on issues ranging from education to temperance. On the final evening each committee presented their resolutions on the individual concerns addressed at the convention. The most extensive and detailed solutions addressed the criminal justice and education systems. They advocated a change in the jury system that would allow the participation of black men. They also sought regulations for chain gangs and prison life and the adoption of an anti-lynching law. In education, the men desired a six-month school year, and more private and public funding for schools, especially from the state. The men researched other important issues and reported, although following the convention, no significant public changes were made. Following the Civil War and the ending of slavery, whites needed a new way to cope with free blacks in the society. They solved this problem by adopting Jim Crow laws and segregation policies. While almost all aspects of public life became segregated in the South, education and the criminal justice system were two of the most intensely separated between the races. Schools differed among blacks and whites on the school year, funding, and facilities. White children attended school for six months, three months longer than black children. The white schools also received the majority of the state's education budget for new schools, textbooks, and materials. The remaining money in the budget was given to black schools, which was barely sufficient to keep schools running. The criminal justice system was just as poorly run. Georgia employed a chain gang and the prisons housed predominantly black convicts. The criminals were held at the mercy of white guards and officials who had no hesitation in allowing the prevalence of assault, hunger, sex, inadequate clothing, and even disease. It was not uncommon for guards to hire out black prisoners for labor-an arrangement that resembled slavery. While the Georgia men at the convention tried to make these blatant discriminations disappear, very little came of it.

His extensive description included that he spoke French and English and was wearing a gray coat with dark pants. Two of his front teeth were missing and he appeared to be of a griff color. Twenty dollars was offered as a reward for his return or any information that would lead to his location. It was common for men to attempt an escape; in most cases it was easier to risk their life than to watch as their wives were taken advantage of or have no power when it came to the sale of their children.","In a study of runaway notices from local newspapers, 76 percent of all runaways were under 35 and 89 percent of them were men. The risks involved in attempting to leave the premises were ignored by many slaves because the idea of freedom was so immense.

Canada lay at the end of what was to be a long and dangerous journey. In some instances, a free black man impersonated a slave and led slaves off plantations to follow miles and miles of trails until they reached a designated resting station. The fugitives traveled at night by foot, train, or steam boat up North. They were aided by abolitionists involved in the Underground Railroad, which consisted of a vast network of people working together with the purpose of leading slaves to freedom. Whereas the development of the Underground Railroad allowed more slaves to reach safety, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed to prevent alleged runaway slaves from being protected or aided no matter their location. The Fugitive Slave Act was part of the Compromise of 1850 which prohibited slave-trading in the District of Colombia and admitted California as a free state.

In 1870, the state legislature was taken over by the Democrats. Efforts to reduce black political power-such as a poll tax-were enforced. The new Democratic legislature removed Campbell from office, and replaced him with a white Democrat.

Looking at Virginia's entire 2 district (heavily African American), which included these Tidewater counties, Democrats appeared to have netted about 4,000 votes, greatly slimming the opposition's lead. Sensing the reaction of Mahone's Readjuster Party, which commanded the Virginian Republican vote, the Democrats planned appropriately. Contacting a renowned gunsmith in Portsmouth, they ordered fifty new Winchester rifles, to be strategically dispersed near important voting precincts. Along with the men unafraid to use these guns, this stern measure of intimidation hoped to discourage white Mahonite leaders from inciting the newly disenfranchised black voters to attack the polling places. Celebrating such an important political gain, Southampton Democrats held a large rally at Newsome's farm attended by great numbers of local farmers. "," Virginia's Reconstruction Constitution in 1869 gave blacks and previously disenfranchised poor whites the right to vote, thus largely expanding the electorate in what had been the South's largest slave holding state. Virginia politics during Reconstruction differed from that of most other former-Confederate states, as no real Republican party emerged. Rather, the Readjuster party took up many Republican platforms, and quickly became the party of the African American vote. The Readjusters combined the black vote with that of the poor whites, and it appeared as if a coalition, capable of challenging the white ruling elite, had finally arisen. Sensing disaster, the Democrats began to couch their political appeals in the late 1880's in strictly racial terms, hoping to appeal to a sense of white solidarity. As they defended themselves from the Readjuster onslaught, Democrats also sought to disenfranchise blacks, thereby stifling a future biracial coalition. "," Unfortunately for the Democrats, the Fifteenth Amendment made it very difficult to restrict the right to vote for race-based reasons at face value. Thus, in this period of Redemption, election officials (most often Democrats themselves) would employ registration and election restrictions that they knew targeted blacks and, subsequently, some poor whites. Oftentimes, they would also commit outright voter fraud by stealing ballots, stuffing ballot boxes, or erasing names from the registration. Virginia also adopted the Australian ballot, aimed at confusing those who could not read, by not listing party names next to candidates, and giving voters less than two minutes in the voting booth. Nonetheless, black leaders, especially in the Tidewater area, continued to resist such coercive measures by flooding the polls with blacks, even if their votes were not being counted. "," Motivated, predominately, by the desire to more effectively hinder the black vote, Virginia, and other Southern states, underwent constitutional conventions in the 1890's. Resulting in residency requirements, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, the South crippled the non-Democratic vote, evidenced by the drastic decline in voter turnout. Whereas 75 percent of eligible voters voted in 1890, this figure dived to 33 percent by 1900. Outright intimidation, though rare, also would emerge in the form of the Klu Klux Klan and the Red Shirts, vigilante groups who ensured few blacks would slip through the cracks. In Virginia's eastern counties, resistance to such Democratic injustice could also spell doom at the hands of newly purchased Winchester rifles.

While the Democrats had already taken over the Georgia state legislature as early as 1870, the party wished to appease any fears that black citizens may have about the end of Republican rule.  On November 12, 1884, the <em>Savannah News </em>contained an article titled A Word to the Colored People, written by an unnamed Democratic party member.  The author ensured black citizens that they need have no fears that there will be any attempt by the Democratic party to abridge any of the rights and privileges which they gained after the Civil War.  In fact, he insisted that the Democrats were much more willing to help blacks further their condition in the South than the Republicans ever were.  With the Democrats in control, the opportunities of colored men to advance as their race increases in intelligence and improves its condition, will be far greater than they are at present.

African Americans composed a majority of the Republican Party's support.  In reaction, the Democrats' political goals included limiting the power of black citizens through instituting poll taxes and new registration requirements.  By communicating their acknowledgement of black enfranchisement, Democrats attempted to detract electoral support from the Republicans.  This movement of Democrats to increase black support for the party was called the New Departure.

He was formerly enslaved in Virginia (his mother was still there) and worked for the Petersburg Intelligencer. He was known for his skill at the printing press. ","The owner believed that Tom had left Charleston by ship and perhaps had forged his own free papers. The owner thought he may have been pretending to need passage to a Camp Meeting. Camp Meetings were the religious craze of the era and were connected most with the Methodist Church. There was a camp meeting being held at a local creek, and it would have considered un-Christian to refuse passage of a black man to a religious service. Many whites justified slavery as a way to spread Christianity to people who would otherwise live without it. ","There were rewards for the return of Tom to the owner (B.S. Thomas) that increased depending on the effort involved in Tom's return. His description is given as 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a bright yellow complexion. Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free. Considering his education and connections, Tom would have been able to get away with a lot of things without being questioned. ","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822.

On the morning of the shooting, Wilcox entered the saloon in which Miller was seated. When he received no compensation upon demand of the money, he fatally shot Miller. Wilcox immediately escaped to the Fork Deer bottom, where he was pursued by the Sheriff and his men.","In the South, this kind of violence was an ordinary occurrence as many people opted to take justice into their own hands rather than leave it to the authorities. Historian C. Vann Woodward says The South seems to have been one of the most violent communities of comparable size in all Christendom. This kind of violence in the post- Civil War American South was extremely prevalent, as homicides alone sometimes doubled and tripled the number of such deaths prior to the War. Old census reports exist, however prove unreliable because the reports usually fell far short of the number of actual homicides. ","Freedmen such as Miller appeared in newspapers often for violent offenses as did others, but usually situations involving them were labeled colored. This significance allowed the majority of the newspapers' intended readers, white society, to understand what African Americans were capable of. ","However distinct the reports of incidents such as the shooting between Miller and Wilcox became towards black men, violence of the South in general could not have been attributed to only African Americans because in several southern states white men were killed much more often in proportion to their own population. Southern newspapers of the day were often crowded with homicides between professionals such as lawyers, planters, railroad presidents, doctors, preachers, and editors. The cause for many of these homicides were usually trivial, but were influenced by the phenomena of how carrying a pistol became normal for many Southerners.

However, she was scheduled to leave for Europe to meet with her husband, and the plantation would have to continue its day-to-day activities without her supervision. Leigh wrote in her diary that she worried about leaving the place entirely in charge of the negro captains, even though her slaves were recognized within her community as well behaved. However, to her surprise, the workers approached her and begged that [she] would leave some one over them in [her] place when [she] left. They pleaded, Missus, we must have a white men to back us when you are gone; de people not mind what we say. To her great relief, Leigh was able to employ a white overseer to manage the black laborers in her absence. He was a man recommended to her by trusted neighbors. Later in her diary she wrote that neighbors spoke of how well kept her plantation was and how orderly the black workers were compared to others. ","Not only was Leigh nervous about leaving the plantation without a white overseer, but the black workers themselves were as well. They insisted on having a white manager to increase the legitimacy of their place above the other black laborers. Perhaps having a white overseer acknowledge the black captains' positions within the hierarchy on the plantation increased the respect they were shown by their fellow hired-hands. Later in her diary, Leigh wrote that there existed two vital characteristics that a successful overseer must possess: he must be southern, and a gentleman. She surmised that only Southerners were capable of understanding blacks and their peculiarities. Northerners, no matter how hard they tried, would never be able to understand their characters. Northerners had not lived their entire lives alongside the blacks; they had not experienced the trials and tribulations of every day life that influence people's development. Southerners had grown up with blacks who they considered a part of the family. Additionally, class was extremely important. Leigh observed that it was useless to put a person holding an inferior social position over them, because the laborers were highly conscientious of class dynamics. Having been at the bottom of the social hierarchy for so long, African Americans recognized that emancipation had opened up the opportunity for social advancement. Through hard work they could gradually move up in society. In the fields, though, they were less likely to work hard if their overseer was not of a higher class. They did not consider him worthy of their deference or respect. It was not enough that the overseer be white; he must be of a distinguished character. The dynamics of the relationship between the hired black laborers and their white employer represent a post-war South that seemed to replicate antebellum social practices. And yet, the importance of class hints at a growing indication that blacks were aware of their status as freedmen. They understood that their place in the social hierarchy was no longer permanently stagnant.

The newspapers prior to the Civil War are full of reminders that not all people were in fact equal. Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD.

The traders were not considered to be the nicest of men, but it was a business, and they were in it to make money. Local traders would start small, and gradually build their enterprises. Sales were commonly made from farm to farm within a region. An ad directly above the aforementioned runaway notice declared a sale of slaves because of the owner's death. The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9. It is presumed that this family would be split among different farms in the region; a reality that was a constant incentive for slaves to behave.

Fowler reportedly had planned to notify U.S. detectives to work the lynching case, hence his beating. ","The White Caps were a vigilante group who operated in Eastern Tennessee in the late nineteenth century.

Mob violence first became popular in the South during the Antebellum Period as a form of systematic terrorism against whites as opposed to blacks, who were valuable as chattel. However according to historian W. Fitzhugh Brundage, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction fueled violence against blacks as whites refused to accept emancipated slaves' quest for economic and political power. Lynching became a favored practice of these mobs, as it mirrored the 'Tyburn gallows,' which were notorious in ancient London as the site of public executions by hanging. These executions became public spectacles and the executed bodies would remain hung as a symbol of justice and warning to those willing to disobey social norm. The number of lynchings in the South began to rise in the 1880s, climaxing in 1892 where mobs executed an estimated seventy one whites, as well as one hundred and fifty five blacks, the largest number of lynchings in history of both the South and the United States of America.

Lear wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of Jefferson and apparent heir to his estate, regarding a specific plan for the education of free blacks. The core of Lear's plan was to purchase young slaves and for them Education in plain literature & mechanical arts, and at a proper age transport them to the Colony in Africa to be as useful there as they may. Lear's letter also related to Randolph the following information about Jefferson's attitude toward the fund he approved very heartily the plan I then proposed to adopt, tho' he declined to give any advice or express any opinion in the matter, considering himself - now without authority."," Lear wrote this letter shortly after meeting with northern groups dedicated to the education of free blacks. The African School in New Jersey had been established in 1817 by the Presbyterian Synod of New York. New York Protestants created the school for the specific the goal of instructing blacks as preachers and teachers. Once free black people received such an education, they could be sent to Liberia or Haiti to help establish stable societies. This plan accorded with the vision of the American Colonization Society, a national initiative established in 1818, which channeled white efforts to cautiously deal with the slavery question. Whites Americans who supported plans in which education and colonization for blacks went hand in hand tended not to address a related question: If, as they believed, free blacks could become good citizens of an overseas colony through education, why could they not do so in America? Most free blacks roundly opposed colonization; they preferred to remain in the only country their family had known for generations, and work there for the freedom of black Americans still in slavery. Only about 15,000 free American blacks moved to Liberia over three decades time. Of those who did colonize, many professed a desire to spread Christianity by missionary work.","Despite the ideological support groups of white Americans sometimes afforded plans to educate blacks, and widespread backing among African Americans themselves, the support often took inadequate financial form. The African School of New Jersey ran out of money within a few years after its establishment. As it turns out, Kosciusko's fund could not be used to support it as Lear and Randolph had hoped.

Regardless, stories of the North and specifically, a place referred to as Philadelphia, were incentive enough to prompt some to brave the terrifying unknown and escape the even more terrifying world in which they were already bound. At some point during the day - or perhaps it was the night - of April 9, 1847 a certain enslaved girl called Harriet disappeared from her owner's home in New Orleans. Details are not disclosed: was Harriet a slave on a large plantation or smaller home within the city? Had she just arrived? Did she have any children - or was she even old enough to bear a child? For all the mystery surrounding her departure from New Orleans, the fact remains that at least her owner was convinced that she had run away. "," A few days later, a small ad appeared in the <em>Times-Picayune</em> offering a 20 reward for this runaway. The description was still minimal, the ad offering only a few characteristics: She has a mark on her forehead, and a pleasing smile when spoken to. Information about her age or coloring was noticeably lacking, but the few brief sentences that were there did offer some insight into this woman's life. According to the owner, Harriet spoke not only English, but also French and Spanish. Her Spanish skills are rather mysterious, as there was virtually no Spanish influence in Louisiana at that point in Antebellum New Orleans. This may have been unintentional, but the fact also remains that Harriet's first listed language was French. The ad also included a stern admonition towards ship captains: they were overtly warned against harboring her."," These details hint at a life that may have been a bit out of the ordinary. The description about Harriet's disappearance, and the information that her owner chose to disclose, suggests that she may not have taken the typical escape route northward, but instead had access to escape via some waterway. The illegal nature of that was easily dismissed in light of Harriet's own defiance of the law. The slave trade was very much alive and well in the world of 1847 Louisiana, but the importation of slaves from Africa to the United States had been put to an end in 1807, after Thomas Jefferson signed a bill with that explicit purpose. Of course, this government action merely meant to some that their business operations would from then on be considered illegal. At that point, slavery had already become an integral part of the American economy, and taking legal action against the institution did not mean that it would quickly or easily fade away into oblivion. Furthermore, in that same year of 1807, plantation owners approved of legislation in their new territory of Louisiana that effectively prevented any slave from potentially becoming emancipated.

There were many debates regarding the process of convicting felons and whether the jury should make the final decision in cases or if judge should have the ultimate say.

","The fact that the law was such a dominant part of nineteenth century life, creating sufficient jails was necessary in order to house convicted felons. In Adams county escapes from poorly constructed jails were so frequent, the sheriff was forced to adopt methods seen as inhuman in order to maintain security.

Problems with the rapidly growing population played a large role in the design of these facilities especially after multiple embarrassing incidents regarding overcrowded jails had been reported. Because of these issues, in 1822, circuit judges were required to conduct or oversee examinations of jails at least once a year to make sure there were not any outstanding concerns that needed to be fixed.","Along with the costs necessary to construct and maintain court houses and jail facilities it was very expensive to imprison people who had broken the law. One governor of Mississippi demanded immediate trials and banned undetermined times of imprisonment due to the amount of money it cost to hold these prisoners in jail. Other measures were taken towards a similar direction and in 1822 a Mississippi governor allowed all prisoners except the ones who were being held for felonies to walk out of the jail as long the jury believed that they would abide by the decisions made in county court.

The pay was quite reasonable and Northup eagerly took on the job. He accompanied them the entire way down to Washington, D.C. without realizing that this was a cruel trick. Those circus performers were, in fact, slave traders looking to make a quick profit off of selling free men. "," Northup did not realize the true motives of his companions until he awoke one morning bound in chains in a damp and dark cell-like room.

From Washington, Northup was put on a ship with other enslaved people and relocated to New Orleans."," After arriving in New Orleans, Northup's outraged cries of his free status went largely ignored or resulted in angry lashings. He was placed in a slave pen along with many others. First thing next morning everyone received a bath, if necessary, a shave, and a set of cheap but clean new clothes. Northup experienced firsthand the degradation that occurred inside those slave pens; when the customers arrived, the traders paraded the slaves around and allowed them to be patted down, walked about, questioned and otherwise examined. Some of these prospective buyers demanded that the slaves open their mouths and display their teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. The dehumanization continued with mandatory exercise activities taking place. At one point Northup was even called on to provide violin music to the slaves' tortured dancing."," These New Orleans slave pens mocked any notion of innate or universal humanism. The slave traders and future owners translated their own discomfort with the practice of trading people into viewing the so-called 'items' for sale with repulsion. In their eyes, blacks existed purely for the purpose of making them, the whites, a profit. Because of this rationale, traders generally had no desire to attempt to keep many family ties together. Northup witnessed an instance of this: a buyer was prepared to purchase Emily, the daughter of his new slave Eliza, at Eliza's insistence. Before he could make the transaction, however, the trader firmly stated that she was simply not for sale. He wanted to keep her for a few more years until she matured into a more valuable slave.

Upon landing, William Hunter quickly composed a letter to his business associate James Perry to give tidings of his safe arrival. Hunter noted to Perry the presence of 30 Negroes on board and wrote of his plan to inquire of the owner, a settler from Alabama, about the means of their transport into the Mexican territory that was Texas. Hunter clearly expressed interest in importing slaves to Texas, and he was not an inconsequential businessman. Perry, the recipient of his letter, was the brother-in-law of Stephen Austin, the most important player in Anglo-American settlement of Texas, and Hunter conducted business with both of these men. ","Though Hunter's life is poorly documented, much is known about his traveling companion, Stephen Austin. Austin's father, Moses Austin, originally negotiated with the Spanish government to secure a land grant and to bring 300 Anglo-American settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated northern reaches of Spain's North American possessions. Upon Moses Austin's death in 1821 (the same year that Mexico gained independence), the grant passed to Stephen Austin. The specific attention given by Hunter (and presumably shared by Austin) to the importation of slaves into Texas is of great interest due to its place in a primarily business-related letter and the early date at which it occurs. It appears that like other parts of the American South, slavery in Texas was associated with business and profit, regardless of slaveholders' professions of paternalistic sentiment toward enslaved people. Also, the fact that slaves were brought into Texas at such an early stage in Anglo-American settlement is important as it affected later national politics. ","The Mexican government, in fact, frowned upon the form of slavery found in the United States. All slaves in Mexico were legally emancipated in 1829, however Austin's powerful friends managed to secure an exemption from this law for Texas. In composing the Civil and Criminal Regulations that governed his colony, the laws regarding slavery were the only ones imported directly from codes in the American South. Such Anglo-American support of slavery at the highest levels demonstrates both the pervasive nature of the institution and the reason that it eventually became such an issue of contention. In the years before Texas joined the United States, the annexation debate was influenced by Texas's possible status as a slaveholding state. Reminiscent of the conditions that necessitated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Northern residents and anti-slavery forces were concerned with the balance of power shared by slaveholding and non-slaveholding states.

For the county seat, Staunton, state politics became local in the August of 1816, when a statewide convention was held in the town to, according to the Columbian of New York, amend or propose amendments to the [state] constitution. The delegates came specifically to debate questions of representation in the state legislation. As more settlers crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle in the Shenandoah Valley, they agitated for more representation in the House of Delegates-still dominated by lowlanders from the Eastern tidewater region."," Representatives from twenty-four of the western counties and 12 of the eastern counties came to Staunton on August 19. By the end of the convention five days later, the convention had drafted a memorial to be presented to the General Assembly. Noting that despite having less than half of the total population, the 49 counties in the southern and eastern parts of the state had a majority in the legislature, the memorial exclaimed that in a republican government the will of the government should be the law of the land and yet in a state boasting of the pure republican institutions, this first and fundamental principle of republicanism does not exist. The memorial received support from a commission formed by the state government to hear the results of the convention, and a resolution was drafted to hold another convention to rewrite the Constitution. The resolution passed the House of Delegates but was defeated by a vote of twelve to nine in the Senate."," While it did not pass, historian A.E. Dick Howard in his article for the Virginia Law Review, 'For the Common Benefit': Constitutional History in Virginia as a Casebook for the Modern Constitution-maker sees the Augusta Convention of 1816 as a part of a larger sectional conflict between the eastern and western parts of the state. Waves of migration during the eighteenth century, into Shenandoah Valley counties like Augusta, and subsequent prosperity and population boom resulted in political tension between the two parts of the state. These stresses were further exacerbated by economic slumps in the east and a general unwillingness among Tidewater residents to relinquish the power they had held in state politics since the state's creation, as reflected in the appearance of only 12 eastern counties at the Convention. The matter would not be settled until a convention was held in 1828 to reform the constitution."],"display_date":"August 19, 1816 - August 24, 1816","search_date":"1816-08-21","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3491,"title":"Sugar Plantations\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-12-28","end_date":"1835-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the nineteenth century Louisiana was one of the country's largest producers of sugar. The sugar plantations contributed to the American economy and although they were not always the wealthiest of ventures, the proved to be objects of mystique to travelers passing through southern Louisiana.","One such visitor to Louisiana was William Gray Fairfax of Virginia. Gray was on his way to Texas with a company of men when they stopped near Donaldsonville, Louisiana. While stopped, Madame Toureau of a nearby plantation, showed Gray then inside of her sugar house. The idea of a plantation was nothing new for Gray but he remarked on several things he saw while visiting the sugar plantation. He commented on the slaves, saying, the Negroes could only speak French; this points to the French settlement of the area. Although the plantation in Gray's eyes had the appearance of wealth he wrote further on that the figures he collected on the profit of the industry were a small yield for the apparent size and force. This shows that despite the work put into the crop, sugar cane was not always the most profitable crop in Louisiana.","Sugar plantation, like the one Gray visited, grew out of the vicinity of New Orleans in the period 1742-1795. This originated with French Creole planters that lived in the area. At this time, farmers focused on indigo and tobacco which provided a plantation foundation for the growing industry. In the next two decades, the sugar cane industry expanded in all directions while early frosts, poor soil, and the intrusion of the profitable cotton industry confined sugar cane production to southern Louisiana. The new technological advances in production tools, such as the boiling apparatus, propelled sugar cane's expansion and rooted it in the economy of Louisiana by the second decade of the nineteenth century. ","In order to glean a profit from the sugar business, the partners needed a large amount of labor. The slaves of the plantation supplied the manpower in the fields and in the mills. During the harvest slaves worked even longer hours...[and] raced against the weather to collect the harvest before the first frost and attacks by insects. This was backbreaking work and during the act of processing the crop, it was not unusual for several slaves to be injured by the rollers as they fed stalks into the mill or tried to untangle stalks from flywheels.","Although Gray was only a passerby in the plantation world of Louisiana, his eyes were opened to a larger part of the United States economy. By seeing a working sugar plantation, Gray saw a fixture of Louisiana agriculture and financial system. In his mind cotton planting must be more profitable, and he could not register the need for a large amount of laborers when the profit was small. He observed a part of history where slaves labor was crucial and where the industry profited from it."],"display_date":"December 28, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-28","locations":[{"id":5413,"lat":30.154068203,"lng":-91.0248645369,"zoom":9,"place":"ASCENSION, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3494,"title":"Wanted: Experienced Cook, World Traveler, Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-06-15","end_date":"1815-08-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A black enslaved man named Henry ran away from the Staunton, Virginia plantation of John G.

A remaining 82 was due to them later on account. Other slaves were also rented out. W. Russell paid out a sizable 70 for Pompey's labor, while Joseph Sharry doled out a mere 10 for Flora's services. Lewis's family later sold Flora for 400 and then spent 20 on cord and other items. Debits and credits. Debits and credits. Alongside wheat and shares of bank stock, his estate bought and sold people in the account books. Lewis's family let Sally keep her child and newborn baby when they sold the three for 17. The newborn baby brought in 5 alone. On the other hand, due to her poor eyesight, Caroline's buyer and seller considered her worth nothing more than the cost of her food and clothes. To the Lewis family, Caroline was an 'investment', and her disability meant that they would receive a poor return. "," Lewis's estate guardians knew they had to pay the bills and they chose to pay off expenses with people. In 1834 and 1835, his family was able to cover their debts by hiring out or selling enslaved people to others. Black families had to suffer for the white family to maintain its comfortable way of life. To soothe their patriarchal consciences, Lewis's family made a point in his accounts to note how they kept mothers and children together when they sold them. Lewis's story was not atypical. Upon his death, guardians had probably taken control of his estate and hired out or sold enslaved people to keep his dependents in comfort. The rising popularity of hiring out enslaved people signaled an economic shift in the South. As some basic industry entered into southern communities, it became more profitable to rent out a portion of the enslaved population to work in the primitive factories that sprouted up in the mixed agricultural economy rather than keeping them on the farms. Slave labor was cheaper than free labor, so it appealed to factory owners as well. "," Some of Lewis's enslaved people might also have been eventually sold further South from Virginia. With land better suited to produce for the booming cotton market than the tobacco-oriented Upper South, the Deep South's demand for forced labor increased even as its northern neighbors' supply of unnecessary labor rose. Deep South demand meeting Upper South supply ensured a forced southern migration of enslaved people. Sophisticated slave trading firms in big southern cities like Norfolk or Richmond used urban slave markets to oblige the economy by sending down enslaved black people from further North to New Orleans and elsewhere. Slave dealers sold the vast majority of enslaved people in direct bargaining processes with potential buyers in the slave pens. Rapid sales in massive public auctions did not occur as frequently.

According to the Wellsburg Herald, the black population of Wellsburg had been meeting nightly at societies or parties at the residences of other free blacks. But on this particular night something went wrong, or as the local white-owned newspaper mused, [the party] appears...to have been diverted from its legitimate object - affording an opportunity for the younger classes to meet, court, and sport together. The -'green-eyed monster' jealousy was of course not idle. A young free black man by the name of Thomas Groves was in town briefly as an employee on the steamer Miami and attended the party. When he left the house in the company of a local black woman, he got into an altercation with a group of local black men over his relationship with the woman. In the ensuing quarrel a member of the group pulled out a pistol and killed Groves. Though the identity of the actual killer was not known at press time, six of the men had been arrested on charge of being concerned in the riot. A hearing was scheduled for that afternoon.","Western Virginia, soon to become the new state of West Virginia, did not secede from the Union, and thus became a haven for free black men and escaped slaves during and after the Civil War. The border between West Virginia and Virginia was an important escape route from the Confederate states to the Upper South. Many former slaves were drawn to the area by the promise of a large number of high-paying jobs created by the burgeoning mining and timber industries. But in some cases, the influx of newly-free blacks was scarcely tolerated by the whites of the northern Border States. In an area that had traditionally had few blacks because of the lack of demand for slaves, the immigration of African Americans heightened tensions between the two races. The high tensions sometimes led to violence. In this case, however, the violence was limited to the black race, and so was looked on more as a diversion rather than cause for alarm.","Many of these escaped slaves became useful members of the Union Army, and some even became soldiers after conscription of African-Americans was approved in 1863. However, white attitudes toward free blacks in the South would remain a problem well into the 20th century, and soon black-on-black crime would be relatively ignored by many local southern authorities. Though the men in this case were arrested and perhaps even given a trial, this attitude of disdain among the whites would only increase during Reconstruction, and eventually transform into the codified racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the displacement of large groups of slaves during the Civil War and the sudden complete emancipation of the 14th Amendment, blacks and whites would be forced to deal with each other on grounds unfamiliar to both races.

A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation. This rivalry was still a factor in many parts of the South, even in the 1850s, especially in the less settled regions. Many parts of western Virginia were still wilderness at this time, and so this story would hold particular relevance for those in the less settled parts of the state."],"display_date":"June 26, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-26","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3507,"title":"Augusta County, Nat Turner, and Abolition","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1831, the news of Nat Turner's rebellion provoked a seemingly unexpected response from women in Augusta County, Virginia: a call for abolition.

They could not hide the fears which agitate our bosoms, and the dangers which await us, as revealed by recent tragical deeds. Apparently the women believed that the slaves, once emancipated, would have little incentive to revolt. Further, the women were ready to take on the lost labor themselves.  Tell us not of the labors & hardships we shall endure when our bondservants shall be removed from us. They have no terrors for us, the petition continued."," The <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the county, would later publish additional information on what is perhaps the same push for local women for emancipation. The <em>Annals</em> relate how, in 1831 John McCue, one of the State Delegates from Augusta, presented a memorial to the State Legislature signed by 215 Augusta women praying for emancipation. While emancipation was not granted, the Women were not alone. The Annals report that there were numerous other petitions from Augusta County as well."," Although contrary to the conventional view that slavery in the South was immutable, the women's' petition probably did not fall on deaf ears in the Virginia Legislature. Historian Scot French notes that the State Legislative session of 1831 and 1832 following Nat Turner's Rebellion, became a debate over the future of slavery, the specter of black insurgency, and the possibility of solving this problem through abolition and removal of African Americans from the state. French quotes James McDowell, from Augusta's neighboring county, Rockbridge, as commenting on the large number of black victims killed in a frenzied white response to the revolt: Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his deluded and drunken handful of followers which produced or could produce such effects? Was it this that induced distant counties where the very name of Southampton was strange to arm and equip for struggle? No, sir, it was the suspicion eternally attached to the slave himself, the suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family.

He spent much of his first two years in the mountains of West Virginia, as the horn player in a military band attached to Rutherford B. Hayes' 23rd Ohio Infantry. On April 14, 1862, he wrote home to his parents to describe a former slave, or contraband, who came in about a week ago and began to work for the brigade. Templeton described the man as a very pleasant fellow and works well. Says he will stay with us and go with us home. Two weeks later, his parents received another letter mentioning the escapee, this time to relay the facts of his death. You remember I told you we had a contraband at work for us? He took sick and died very suddenly on Tuesday last. We did all we could for him. He was only sick two days. The doctor pronounced his disease inflammation of the stomach. He was a fine fellow and we miss him very much. ","As slaves fled from their former owners during the chaos of war, they often attached themselves to the advancing Union army. Though some slaves attempted to make the dangerous journey to the states of the Union, the advancing northern army was often the closest and safest option. Everywhere the northerners went, escaped slaves followed, usually to be held by the advancing army as contraband from the enemy. The Virginia-West Virginia border provided a perfect opportunity for many other slaves to escape, as West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863 on the condition it would be a free state with a plan of gradual emancipation for those currently enslaved. Since the state shared a long border with the largest slaveholding state in the Confederacy, Virginia, it was a popular escape route for many slaves. ","As Templeton's letter indicates, the new contraband went to work for the soldiers of the Union brigade. All over the South, contrabands worked for the northern army in many different roles, as laborers, hospital workers, cooks, and often body servants for federal officers. They became a vital part of the workings of the Union army. Slaves were even put to work for the Confederate cause, usually pressed into building trenches or fortifications, and thousands went into the field with their masters as personal servants. By the end of the war, Jefferson Davis was even pressing for the conscription of slaves into the Confederate army, with promises of freedom for those who volunteered. Though this Southern plan was never put into action, the North did indeed recruit and arm runaway slaves, as well as free blacks from the northern states.

According to the<em> Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the County, it all had started when Maria, one of Dr. McChesney's enslaved children, came to dinner one night very much frightened, apparently having been chased by an old woman with her head tied up. Soon after, stones began to fall on the McChesney's roof in intervals-both at night and day. The <em>Annals</em> record that the stones averaged about the size of a man's fist, and some of them were too large to be thrown by a person of ordinary strength. Occasionally, some of the stones were hot, and scorched the dry grass on which they fell."," The McChesney's tried sending Maria to their in-laws, the Steeles. The situation was no better there. As Maria approached, the white family found themselves with all the furniture in their large room piled up promiscuously. Sods of dirt began to rain down on their house. Soon, Maria began to complain of being beaten with slaps that the Steele's could hear but could do nothing about. Maria would eventually fall down exhausted and the beatings would stop. As the Annals recount, worn out with these troubles, Dr. McChesney, as a last resort, sold Maria, and she was taken South. As soon as she left the disturbances ceased and they never followed her in her new home. ","   Questions of the supernatural aside, a certain paternalism towards his slave permeates Dr. McChesney's behavior-paternalism that Walter Johnson describes at length in his history of the Slave Market, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Much of this ideology implied that the owner knows what is best for his slaves, a fantasy readily seen in the way the slave owner's decision to send the child down South is also her cure. The logic of paternalism leads to the justification that it was burden of the child's troubles which forced him, only as a last resort, to sell her.

On a Saturday night in late October 1832, Joseph Wienand, the manager of the Neptune Hotel in Charleston, was murdered. Apparently, he was in possession of between 200 and 300 in cash. His murder was discovered by his African-American female servant at close to 6 a.m. the next day. After repeatedly rapping on his door to awaken him to start the day, the servant became nervous and forced her way into his room. He was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Upon investigation by a coroner, it was declared that he was murdered by strangulation with a handkerchief and by blows to his head with a stone. It was a sad fate for Mr. Wienand, a good member of Charleston society. ","Like any other city, murder and crime were facets of life in Charleston; however, it was not a huge problem for the antebellum city. In fact, the problems of regulating crime were more centered on slaves and free blacks rather than whites. Whether a white person or a black person killed Mr. Wienand is not known. However, it was quite apparent that as time wore on, white members of Charleston society who committed crimes were subjected to more lenient punishments than their black counterparts. In fact, city leaders became so worried about slaves and free African Americans committing crimes that the Charleston Work House was established in 1839. That year, the Work House became a house of correction for slaves. In addition to becoming a place for the punishment of slaves who committed various offenses or crimes, the Work House was also established so that the city would have a central place for a slave market. The work house was run under Spartan conditions and in a correctional manner. Many considered it a deterrent to committing crimes. No one wanted to go to the Work House. In addition, it was designed in a Gothic Revival style, similar to that of many churches built after the Great Fire of 1838, serving as a reminder that the righteous did not commit crimes like that one that was so cruelly bestowed on Mr. Wienand. ","Judging from the murder of Charleston hotel manager Joseph Wienand, one would assume Charleston was unsafe. However, as Maurie McInnis points out in a chapter of her book, <em>The Politics of Taste in Antebellum Charleston</em>, crime was greatly controlled in Charleston during the 1830s and 1840s, thanks in large part to fear of being incarcerated in the Work House. Most Charlestonians need not worry that they would be victims like Mr. Wienand."],"display_date":"October 29, 1832","search_date":"1832-10-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3527,"title":"Slaves Drown While Fishing\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-08-01","end_date":"1842-08-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a blustery summer day, August 1, 1842, a fishing boat in which five slaves were traveling was swamped and capsized. Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3529,"title":"Slave Sale Comes in Many Forms\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-05-20","end_date":"1836-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["ohn Stapleton, an English attorney, handled the affairs of several Charleston properties included in the estate of Mrs. Hannah Bull. He managed the sale of her slaves, cattle, hogs, sheep and other effects of Mrs. Bull's properties after her death. In a letter to Higham, Fife & Co. dated May 20, 1836, Stapleton detailed the sale of several slaves and included the titles. As the attorney, the money realized from the purchases was received through Bills of Exchange.","In 1836, the sale of slaves was increasing as the need for their labor moved farther and farther south. South Carolina was at an economic standstill; at the time of this letter, Charleston was about as anti-entrepreneurial as it could become. South Carolina's rice culture was in decline, and cotton farms were appearing all over the Deep South. Therefore, many slaves found themselves sold to outlying plantations and other states at a very fast rate. According to Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em> it was necessary for South Carolinians to obtain legal assistance when attempting to sell their slaves, just as Mrs. Bull did. In addition, Mr. Stapleton sold her slaves by private bargaining rather than in a huge slave market. Although popular image dictates slaves were sold in large venues, often there was a lot of behind-the-scenes private bargaining that took place, as it did with this sale. Johnson notes that even though much of the slave trade remained rural and personal like this sale, there were increasing opportunities during this time for trade in large, urban centers, such as New Orleans, Louisiana. ","Selling her slaves through her lawyer may have been one of the least cruel ways Mrs. Bull knew to convey them. Allowing her estate to be liquidated rather than sold through an attorney would have almost guaranteed cruel treatment in slave market, as seen in Johnson's book. Perhaps she was attempting to portray the role of the benevolent slave holder, like so many other South Carolina slave holders did before the Civil War in order to shed a more positive light on the institution of slavery."],"display_date":"May 20, 1836","search_date":"1836-05-20","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3533,"title":"Massachusetts Judge Driven from South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-11-01","end_date":"1844-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The people of Charleston were not above standing up for what they believed in, even at the expense appearing rude and overzealous. Judge Samuel Hoar of Concord, Massachusetts, and his daughter, Elizabeth, traveled to Charleston in November of 1844. Their intentions were not known when the trip was announced; however, soon after they arrived, it became clear that the Massachusetts judge had come to Charleston to assist the state of Massachusetts' citizens in dealing with South Carolina law. Free black sailors from the Northern state were attempting to load cotton onto Massachusetts' ships. However, those were soon impounded, and the captains were forced to pay a ransom or the African Americans on board would be sold into slavery. South Carolinians did not feel that Massachusetts had any business meddling in their affairs. In a resolution passed by the South Carolina state legislature, they called Judge Hoar an emissary of foreign government, even though South Carolina was still part of the Union at this time. In addition, the resolution declared that even free blacks are not citizens of the United States under the Constitution. It also called for Judge Hoar's immediate expulsion from the city. ","It was rumored that Hoar and his daughter left the city on account of actual mob violence. However, the apparent truth was that they left the city after being asked to leave to avoid violence. Although Hoar was not backing down on the issue, he was also not attempting to have physical harm done to him by what seemed to him as some unsavory Charlestonians. ","At the heart of this issue are South Carolina's unwavering commitment to slavery and its loyalty to secessionism. Additionally, Hoar's experience was perhaps all a misconception and misunderstanding, as many Northern visits to the South were. However, by the time of the 1840s, even free blacks who resided in Charleston were in a precarious situation. Many were not legally emancipated, but had found ways to circumvent the law. Although they were often respected as contributing members of the economic totem pole, they had to tread carefully in order not to make the white elite of the city angry. For the Charleston free blacks, their freedom was only determined by how kind the white members of society felt, since they were not actually free. This is supported by Bernard Powers in his book <em>Black Charlestonians</em>. While he acknowledges the great accomplishments of free blacks in antebellum Charleston, evidence greatly supports that their successes were always at the hands of the elite lawmaking white. No wonder outsider free blacks who had no personal ties to the city were taken hostage. In addition to the fact that they were not legally emancipated, by 1850, free blacks were competing with an immigrant population for jobs. Their whole life situation was always at the hands of others. Unfortunately, this particular incident involving Jude Hoar ended quite badly and was eventually a detrimental blow to South Carolina's willingness to stay in the Union."],"display_date":"November 1844","search_date":"1844-11-15","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3534,"title":"A Remarkable Case of Slave Manumission\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-03-14","end_date":"1844-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Slavery was not a permanent institution for some Southerners. In 1838, Dr. Brisbane, a Charleston, South Carolina resident, sold his twenty-seven slaves in order to move to Cincinnati, Ohio. While in Cincinnati, he decided that he did not want his former slaves to be subjected to bondage any longer. Brisbane returned to Charleston in 1844. Searching for and finding the twenty-seven enslaved African Americans, he bought them back at a cost of 6000 more than what he had received for their sale. He and newly reacquired slaves departed for Baltimore, Maryland; subsequently, they traveled to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. From there they set out for Cincinnati. Intending to give them their freedom and a head start in their new lives, Brisbane then purchased a tract of land in Hamilton County, Ohio where the formerly enslaved could settle comfortably. ","Did Dr. Brisbane free his former slaves because some of them were his children? Did he free them because he was affected by those around him after he moved to Cincinnati, a locale less in favor of slavery? Neither answer is known. We can, however, speculate that either of these was perhaps the case.

From the idea that African Americans were a lesser race who needed taking care of by white patriarchs to the economic justification, slave owners were always trying to find new ways to dispute those who disagreed with their choice to hold others in captivity. Charleston slave holders were no exception in attempting to find justifications to mask their guilt. Often, religion came into play, on both the slavery and anti-slavery sides of the debate. In 1835, at the end of two long articles about religion and slavery in the Charleston Mercury, it was said that both the Old and New Testament give permission to hold others as slaves. In the Old Testament, God and the Patriarchs approve. As for the New Testament, Jesus and the Apostles show that slavery is permissible. Therefore, slavery, to those who wrote the article, was not an anti-Christian institution. It was just the opposite. Furthermore, they added, it is impious to say slavery is anti-Christian because such a conclusion contradicted God. ","Such extremist beliefs were common in the slavery/antislavery debate. Slaveholders believed that slavery would liberate Africans from their savage-like ways, especially if they were infused with Christianity. As religion ran deep through slavery, white Christian slaveholders argued that slavery was a necessary evil because it would control the sinful, less humane, black race. ","Slave owners, beginning in the 1830s, began to permit black religious gatherings in some forms. In addition, Charleston slaves and free blacks were allowed to attend church with their owners. However, previous slave revolts like Virginia's Nat Turner caused worry that religion would make slaves think they had the right to be free. Turner experienced religious visions that caused him to believe that revolt was divinely ordained. Slaves allowed by their masters to worship were closely monitored thereafter.","Even though the article in <em>The</em> <em>Charleston Mercury</em> claimed that Jesus supported slavery, the Biblical truth is, according to J. Albert Harrill, that Jesus was remarkably silent on the slavery issue. He never outright named it explicitly as a sin. Both sides of the slavery/anti-slavery debate used this ambiguity to their advantage, embellishing the details that supported their case. The slaveholding South stretched the truth and claimed that Jesus permitted slavery. The anti-slavery North claimed that Jesus never said sodomy, blasphemy, and idolatry were sins, even though to Christians, they clearly are. The word of the Lord, to them, did not have to spell out what was right and wrong. Overall, both sides of the debate used religion to their advantage, stretching the truth wherever necessary to help their cause, just as in this article from <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>."],"display_date":"September 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3546,"title":"A Pennsylvania Court Convicts Under the Fugitive Slave Law\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-08-08","end_date":"1851-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the news of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 reached Holly Springs, Mississippi, the citizens were very anxious to see how the North would uphold the laws.  The law stated that if one captures a fugitive slave, it is the responsibility of the law enforcement and citizens to aide in the returning of those slaves to their rightful owners.  The people of Mississippi knew that slaves would attempt to escape, and hoped that these new laws would help them keep the property in which they had invested so much.

Many of the men within the Colored Troops had originally escaped into Washington where they labored in the contraband camps, before joining the Union army.

Magnus L. Robinson, editor of the Weekly Leader noted with chivalry that in Lannon's Opera House every orchestra chair was filled with the fair sex--never have there been before such an array of Afro-American ladies at a public meeting, giving grace and beauty to an occasion which is sacred to every true Afro-American. The evening began with a prayer and the singing of the Star Spangled Banner. Letters of regret from those who could not come were read. That of Hugh McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln, reviewed the history of race relations and the attempts to end slavery in the United States. One of his interesting statements was that voting rights for immigrants should be limited, but voting rights for blacks should not. ","The principal speaker of the evening was James M. Townsend of Indiana. He provided a very direct assessment of the state of race relations in his time: But is it not strange, that now, 28 years after Emancipation --after the Amendments to the Constitution--after settling as we thought forever the question of our citizenship, in this country we helped to make and save, that insult is added to injury by the traitorous men who sought to destroy this government, banding themselves together for the avowed purpose of disfranchising, ostracizing, and by some means or other, getting rid of 8,000,000 of the most loyal, patriotic, and inoffensive people on this continent, simply because of their color. He declared his interest in political and civil equality and in a freedom that comes with an equal chance before the law and in business. He recognized that what he sought would be obtained only if African Americans did most of the work of gaining their civil rights themselves, and he argued that blacks should insist on being treated with appropriate dignity. It was all right with him if young African American women spit in the eye of white men who insulted them. ","As Townsend recognized, his fight for freedom and equality was not in harmony with the intentions of the white society of the time. The rights of black men and women, to vote and travel freely, for example, were being increasingly curtailed. Whites began to rely on segregation laws to restrict blacks. Competing with blacks for farm laborers and other resources aggravated many whites. Despite the overwhelming odds, blacks continued to assert their rights. Nonetheless, African Americans would have to endure decades of abuse before they saw any change in treatment.

The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual.","The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South.","Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

Immediately, she contemplated the need for an organization that supported the black freedmen that were constantly entering the city. Within two weeks, Keckley had won the support of her church in forming the Contraband Relief Association. Keckley was also employed by Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, with whom she traveled to many cities and gained more support for the Association. Mrs. Lincoln and the President also made contributions to help finance the Association, and its success eventually led to Keckley serving as its President in 1863.","Elizabeth Keckley's initiative to create an organization that provided aid for and served the African American community would become very characteristic of African American leaders within the years to come.

Within less than ten years, in 1874, the property of the (now-white) church from which it had split, was given to the black Little Ebeneezer Church. This allowed for the church to build up a large congregation and to become one of the leading black churches within the city.","Black churches underwent significant growth in the years following the Civil War and Reconstruction.

He claimed, however, that the passage of the bill for black suffrage was almost unanimously rejected by the white race. He complained of the fact that the black right to vote had been acceptingly repudiated in several northern states, and yet, it was forced upon the people in Washington against their will. He then went on to say how this would lead to a negative effect upon the white workingmen of the District of Columbia., as it would bring the blacks to an equal footing with them.

Of the three witnesses who testified, two of them were black and one of them was white. The first black witness, known as Henry Barret, testified that the assailant had been a white man who he believed may have been dressed in grey and wearing a hat. The following white witness, George Smith, told the defense that he did not see the accused, Oscar Mankin, shoot at the colored man. Lastly, a black, Jane Green, who was with Anderson on the night of the shooting, recalled talk of a black soldier being beaten up in the street outside, to which Anderson responded saying, he could whip any rebel man who had hit a Union man. She then said that Anderson was met by gunshots from Mankin, who she said may have been wearing a black coat and hat. The doctor who then examined Anderson's wound said its position was the result of the bullet coming from an elevation.

The United States of America was one of the few major players in the world economy that still had a firmly intact system that subjugated a race by the late nineteenth century. However, the race lines were skewed as two men planned to meet each other on the dueling field. Joe Dickerson and George Graham had to see each other in some context as equals. Both were fighting for the same woman even though Joe Dickerson was a free black man. This single duel between Joe Dickerson and George Graham is a reflection of race relations in Florida as of 1892. Florida was no stranger to slavery or free blacks and subsequently created an atmosphere of awkward racial tensions that existed throughout the South following the Civil War and Reconstruction. The love triangle created between a white woman and a man of color and a white man was more than just a dilemma. Inter-racial relations were still frowned upon in southern culture in the late nineteenth century; however, inter-racial relationships were still rampant. In addition, the two men had to meet and converse similar to closing a business deal before the duel could take place. Dueling was considered a civilized practiced in the nineteenth century; a way to defend your honor, and certainly only a man and not a piece of property would be able to defend his honor. ","It was the black man, Joe Dickerson who won the upper hand in the duel and fired before the white man, George Graham, could draw. Consequently, Dickerson fled the scene and his whereabouts were still unknown when the article was published.

Although the evening had started with a small group of African Americans watching a trial of engines between the Richmond and the visiting Wilmington, Delaware Fire Companies, police soon arrested an African American man who allegedly attacked the firemen.  A riot followed, with the mob hurling paving stones at the officers all the way to the station-house.  Captain Junkins, two sergeants, and one private were all seriously injured.  The incident caused enough of a disturbance to compel General Schofield to arrive at the scene along with a company of the 11 Virginia Regiment.  Although the throng initially ignored the General's demands for disbandment, the soldiers ultimately proved to be a more effective catalyst for breaking up the mob.

In the postwar South, blacks widely suffered from brutal beatings and murders as white resentment of the freedom of African Americans grew.  Southern whites who believed in and were accustomed to the racial etiquette between a master and slave frequently attacked blacks for actions deemed impertinent and insolent.  Blacks bidding a white man good morning, for example, could provoke horror in the individual who expected blacks to remain silent unless a white person spoke to them first.  Despite this volatile nature of race relations, however, accounts of blacks assaulting whites were uncommon.

In the evening, the colored people of the city met and formed a group called the Afro-American League. They wrote a preamble and resolutions against the laws requiring separate railroad cars and waiting rooms for blacks and whites. While demanding change in the law, they also wished to educate the population. Their league's object shall be the creation of a healthy public opinion and they will use the church, the press, meetings, and the court system to appeal the laws. "," Whether this League is a branch of the Afro-American League, founded in 1890, is hard to determine from this one article in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> and Vindicator, the weekly paper for Augusta County. The paper did not say it is, and only listed the fourth resolution. The members said they were organizing a league to be known as the Afro-American League and not anything about being a branch league. The paper made no comment for this event and ran no other articles that day which had racism, black people, or blacks' rights as the subject. There were not any follow-up articles the next week either."," By 1891, Reconstruction had ended, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments had been passed, and Jim Crow laws regulating railroads were already in effect. Jim Crow had not fully seized the South though, and Booker T. Washington and Tuskegee Institute were working for blacks' rights. C. Vann Woodward has noted that by 1890, the hope that Reconstruction and the Civil War had brought was nearly gone. Edward Ayers, however, has noted the uncertainty and lack of concrete rules and regulations governing the South in the 1880's. He also intimated that newspapers bear some of the blame for inciting tension because of their stories and skewed coverage of blacks. This type of story of a meeting was not uncommon because black people continuously worked to retain their rights and gain new ones. They saw themselves losing the enfranchisement and losing the possibility of gaining political positions in society. Meetings like the one in Staunton were not everyday occurrences but groups such as the Afro-American League were beginning to form and trying to exert some influence in towns and cities. A South Carolina woman wrote in her diary that, The negroes are evidently in an excited state. It is important to note that the black people of Staunton had a plan of action. They did not meet to complain about their situation but to improve it. They had a document that explained their goals and beliefs. They knew they had to act and knew that using the court system and press were the best routes.

That much was certain as they traveled to Washington D.C. from their rural home with Margaret's sister on Christmas Eve, 1877. What wasn't quite so certain was where in the city they could go to hold the ceremony. When they came upon a group of reporters waiting outside City Hall they anxiously asked how, where, and how fast they could be wed. Luckily, the reporters were just the people to ask.  ","Some of the reporters got them through the door of City Hall and to the Marshal's apartment, while others joined forces with some bailiffs to locate a marriage license and someone to officiate the ceremony. It took hardly any time at all before the two were wed in the Criminal Courtroom by none other then Reverend Byron Sunderland himself, who had come running to perform the marriage. This was the very first marriage in the Criminal Courtroom, which was usually the site of proceedings of a very different nature. That a marriage between two black youths could occur in an unconventional location with the help of all kinds of residents of the city of Washington was symbolic of the progress that the nation was trying to make toward equality for all men. ","However, this example of a spur-of-the-moment public wedding between two young, black individuals is more of an anomaly concerning how the idea of citizenship for freed black Americans actually materialized in real life. As David Herbert Donald points out, despite the fact that racial equality had largely been legislated by the 1870s, not everyone was as accommodating as the folks in Washington were that day.  In many parts of the South, there was no one to enforce the kind of treatment the law demanded. Washington D.C. stands out, at least in this example, as a more progressive part of the South, more in touch with the ideals for which the nation's legislators were striving. The Republicans who were in office had passed many laws requiring equal treatment in public spaces for black and white alike; in the case of this marriage in the courtroom, this idea was taken a step further, and the reporters were thrilled to be catching the first marriage in a criminal court room, a marriage of two black people no less.

M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3601,"title":"Frederick Douglass Addresses the New American Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-02-20","end_date":"1884-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Prohibition Convention of 1884 was held in Lincoln Hall and kicked off on the evening of February 20th.

Bailey, who had just been appointed to the committee responsible for nominating a President and Vice President of the United States, spoke first and set the tone for the evening by highlighting a few key themes of critical importance to the American Party:  the party's firm foundation in Jesus Christ's vision of Democracy, the growing need for temperance and prohibition, the threat of Freemasonry on the nation, and the highly objectionable way in which Republicans seemed to appeal to the black community simply to win votes before elections.  ","With the mood perfectly set for his address, Mr. Frederick Douglass took the stage to present his speech on civil rights. We have got rid of slavery. It is gone, gone, gone, never to return. But its long black shadow stretches across our entire continent...You ask sometimes when this negro question will cease...It will cease when we have one country, one citizenship, one liberty, one equality for all people...  He then spoke to the issue of colonization, heatedly denouncing it as a unthinkable solution to the problem of racial inequality. He asserted that black people wanted to take part in the freedom and progress that was so unique to the United States, a nation that they were as much a part of as white men. In fact, he elaborated humorously, many whites and blacks may be closer in relation than they might think given the history of interracial relationships in America He even indicated to his largely male audience that, in general, men could learn something from the more compassionate and respectful attitudes of women, who he had known to show the kind of sensitivity and care necessary to bridging the gaps between the white and black races. Every last one of his words was met with applause, laughter, admission, understanding, and approbation by all those in the hall, white and black alike. ","Retrospectively, this speech which occurred in 1884 came at a hugely significant time in the history of race relations in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional less than six months before it was presented at the convention of the American Party. By 1885, as historian Valeria W. Weaver explains, the 'Jim Crow' South was really taking shape, severely impeding if not stopping in its tracks, the push toward the equality between whites and blacks that was the foundation of Douglass' mission."],"display_date":"February 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3604,"title":"The Love and Marriage of Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L.

Hubard wrote approximately twenty letters to each other on topics ranging from the health of their respective families to the passion they shared for each other. Randolph lived in Buckingham County, Virginia and made occasional visits to White Sulphur Springs (now a city in West Virginia) while Hubard, who was originally from the same area, wrote his letters from several different locations around Virginia, including Richmond. Presumably, Hubard's recent commission as a colonel of the Virginia militia in 1858 required him to travel frequently for prolonged periods. During this period, militias sprung up all across central Virginia in response to the call for war. In addition to Hubard and Randolph's correspondence, James' little brother Robert T. Hubard also weighed in on the young couple's nuptials, adding his perspective, insight, and advice on starting life together in central Virginia as well as his dealings with African American slaves.","In his first letters to Randolph, Hubard expressed his concern for the health of his future mother-in-law; apparently, she suffered from some sort of ailment that required treatment in the city of White Sulphur Springs. Eventually, Randolph wrote that her mother had gotten better but complained of lovesickness within her own breast, imploring Hubard to break away from his work and visit as soon as possible. The two clearly cared extraordinarily deeply for one another; with each sighing request from Isaetta, James responded with his own assuaging remarks intended to reassure her of his unyielding love, expressed his regret that he could not come visit, and enumerated the many times throughout his daily activities that his mind wandered to her. The couple's excitement builds noticeably throughout the last few weeks of their correspondence, both writing repeatedly about how much they miss the other and, somewhat peculiarly, how their families long to be united through their impending marriage. In a separate letter, Robert T. Hubard wrote about the sickness of his wife Phyllis and that of several of his black slaves; because the slaves were exposed to a mysterious contagion, Robert decided to have Charity [and] her family moved to the house 200 yds west of Sam's house, as [he] did not like to have sick negroes so near [his] dwelling home. ","The relationship between Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L. Hubard was fraught with the difficulties often faced by southern couples during the antebellum period of the nineteenth century. Hubard, a recently commissioned colonel, was separated from Randolph but managed to save their relationship through his persistent writing. Moreover, the desire of the two affluent families to unite with one another represents a common desire of wealthy southerners to prolong their legacy through intermarriage. Their family's wealth, and to some degree benign nature, is exemplified in Robert's letter regarding his sick slaves. A nuanced reading of Robert's distancing of the slaves from his house reveals a form of racial suspicion regarding sick negroes; it seems as if he was more fearful of what was ailing them due their race than the because of the actual sickness itself. At the same time however, the slaves lived in family units, a condition that must tragically be considered a luxury considering the frequency with which children were separated fromtheir parents and husbands were stripped of their wives in the business of slavery."],"display_date":"August 8, 1860 - November 15, 1860","search_date":"1860-09-26","locations":[{"id":13691,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3605,"title":"Commencement at Howard Draws an Illustrious Crowd\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-05-01","end_date":"1879-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It wasn't every day after the Civil War that former slaves and former slave-owners would admit to having something in common, much less celebrate it openly. But in the early summer of 1879 at the commencement exercises for Howard University, they did just that. The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites. Historian Michael Dennis explains that white Southerners realized the necessity of educating the newly emancipated African-American population in order for them to be able to sustain themselves; however, most were only in support of their education if it was separate from that of the white population."],"display_date":"May 1, 1879 - May 30, 1879","search_date":"1879-05-15","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3610,"title":"Washington Says Farewell to Dick Wallach\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-02-26","end_date":"1881-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 26, 1881, the <em>Evening Star</em> printed an article, 'A Noble Life' about Mr. Richard Wallach. Though he had not yet passed away, the city was already mourning his inevitable passing that was sure to come within days.  The residents of Washington, D.C. had been proud to call Richard Wallach their Mayor for several years, and news of his impending death caused many to reflect on the beneficial impact he had had on the city and the well-being of all who lived in it. ","While he was mayor the City Hall, which had previously acquired the bad name of 'the Buzzard's Roost,' was very unhospitable quarters for the noble army of jobbers and strikers, said the <em>Star</em>, describing how full of integrity Mr. Wallach was. That same day, the <em>National Republican</em> sang his praises in an article entitled, 'Waiting for Death': As a citizen he was enterprising, energetic, liberal, laboring zealously and faithfully for the city, which appreciated his efforts on her behalf. Clearly, 'Dick' Wallach's personal and professional integrity had manifested itself in his mayoral accomplishments; the man had set the bar for mayors in Washington's future.  Mr. Wallach passed away during the afternoon on March 4th, 1881. His funeral was attended by many prominent members of the community, black and white, male and female. ","What made Mr. Wallach's death so monumental to the Washington D.C. community was the fact that he symbolized all that education reform had done and was continuing to do for the community. Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3618,"title":"Jacob Enders Buries a Slave Child\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1845 Jacob Enders, an undertaker employed by Dr. Marcus B. Buck of Fluvanna County, Virginia, constructed a coffin, dug a grave, and buried an African American child for the total fee of two dollars and seventy-five cents. This receipt of service is included in a collection of other receipts and letters; a doctor's bill from one John Thomson, dated December 29, 1840 and a letter from Buck's wife are among the most notable documents that exist from around the same time period of the slave's burial. In the letter from Elizabeth P. Buck, she tells the unknown addressee that her husband is quite and that she wants him to go over the ridge, or into the valley. Nineteenth-medicine had very few remedies for the many ailments of central Virginian farmers, and these sicknesses were often transferred from among members of a family living in close quarters as well to and slaves that may have worked on the plantation.","Jacob Enders' notation of the services he rendered for Buck is nondescript and exceedingly simple. The transaction is divided into two parts, enumerated in column form with the description of his action on the left and the price associated with each deed. First, Enders lists Making coffin for Negro child and the figure of one dollar and twenty-five cents; next, Digging grave and interring same is listed as costing one dollar and fifty cents. The coffin was probably made of simple wooden planks and the burial sight was most likely unadorned, perhaps marked by an inauspicious headstone or cross. The life of this particular slave child exists in the mere three lines of Jacob Enders' receipt.","No matter how historians may characterize certain slave owners as benevolent masters who took good care of their slaves, life on a central Virginian plantation for a field slave was brutal. Summers in Fluvanna County were at times unbearably hot and humid, and the close living quarters available to slaves of middle-class farmers were undoubtedly hotbeds for sickness and disease. The fact that Jacob Enders' receipt is apparently scattered amongst other records from Buck's family and friends, including various other doctors' bills and general correspondence from his wife, suggests the insignificance of the young slave's life. Unlike Robert Campbell, a barber in nearby Augusta County whose life was remembered fondly and was actually memorialized in an obituary, this particular slave child was buried anonymously and ignobly. Though human life was expensive on an economic scale, the only record of Buck memorializing or reflecting on the death of this particular human being is captured in a simple document of sale. The inconsequential regard for African American life and the poor living conditions of meager, slaveholding farmers are demonstrated in this incident."],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3621,"title":"Race and Medical Care\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-11-18","end_date":"1831-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 18, 1831 Dr. Stirling Ford paid a visit to the slave of Mrs. Evans.

Although it might seem normal that a doctor would treat an ailing person, not all nineteenth century physicians were willing to take on African Americans, free or enslaved, as patients. Dr. Ford, on the other hand, was known for giving free smallpox vaccines to his patients, both white and colored. Some southern states went as far as requiring masters to provide for proper maintenance of their slaves, this care was mainly achieved through the care of ailing slaves by their master or mistress. Following the 1808 abolition of the international slave trade, the health of slaves became a matter of greater importance to slave owners. Thus, many slave owners paid more attention to seeing that the basic dietary needs of their slaves were met. "," Again, Dr. Stirling Ford was one of the unique physicians willing to treat blacks. In his journal, Dr. Ford delineated all of his patients by various codes according to class, gender, and race. He referred to patients the black patients he served as man, woman, and child. Never in Dr. Ford's records did he use the word slave; instead he referred to enslaved peoples as servant. Though many of his contemporaries did not treat blacks, Dr. Ford was a kindly man, who took his duties as a physician seriously and served all in need of his services. On several occasions, Dr. Ford recorded visiting large plantations, noting that he visited the family, both white and colored. His reference to the black community living on the plantation as the family is an unusual term of endearment reflecting the affectionate concern held by the responsible class of slave owners for the well-being or the slaves that they owned and possibly Dr. Ford's personal views regarding slavery."," Though the law insured some level of healthcare for enslaved people, as aforementioned, many doctors refused to render their medical services to black patients. This attitude can be attributed to the popular belief in the inferiority of black people. This belief in the inferiority of blacks was used not only as a justification for slavery but received a good amount of ill researched of scientific support.

Throughout the south there were periodic crackdowns on free blacks, with officials demanding identification papers and jailing those without proper documents.

However, this inability to vote was not because it was illegal for African Americans to do so. Three hundred armed white men were standing in front of the registry office in the town of Palmetto in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana to prevent them from registering to vote. After the armed men left, a few African Americans had managed to register to vote and were therefore flogged unmercifully for their actions. Following this beating, the group of angry white men went to the home of another black man, Reuben Stelly. After requesting that he come outside to talk with them, Stelly became frightened and shot into the mob, killing a nineteen-year-old white man. In response, the armed mob fired back into the house, killing Stelly and another black man that was with him."," Though African Americans had been given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment nearly 30 years earlier in 1870, white men of the south were still trying to take a stance against this decision. This incident occurred in 1896; just one year after the grandfather clause had been enacted by several of the Southern states in the United States. A grandfather clause is a phrase used when an exemption is put in place that allows an old rule to apply to particular circumstances, while a new rule applies to everything else. This particular grandfather clause was put into place in lieu of the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local laws in the South between 1876 and 1964 that required racial segregation of African Americans in the majority of public areas. The clause stated that those who had the right to vote before 1867 would be exempt from any property, tax, or educational requirements for voting, and their descendents would have the same exemption. Because African Americans had not been given the right to vote until 1870, the clause effectively excluded blacks from voting. However, it still guaranteed the right to vote to many illiterate and poor white men. As a result of this clause, any African American attempting to register to vote would face quite an ordeal. The type of situation that Reuben Stelly was involved in was obviously chaotic, with racism motivating irrational actions. It was very common for groups of white men to gather in this way to protest the voting rights of black men. When violence erupted from these types of circumstances, it was typical for them to result in an unjust case that was unfairly represented on the part of the black man. Clearly, Reuben Stelly acted drastically because he knew what the situation entailed. The mob of white men did not just want to talk to him; he had registered to vote - exactly what they didn't want him to do. Unfortunately, this situation resulted in casualties on both sides.

In selecting members, the group had to be especially careful to not approach the wrong men to join. However, they did exactly that, thus making the clan and its goals well known. Unfortunately for Stern, regulators were notified of the group and served notice on him to leave the area. The other members of the society were given warnings as well, and like Stern, they ignored their seriousness. Nevertheless, Stern and his cohorts did not pay any attention to the notifications, and later regulators sent them more. In an effort to remain in the area, Stern showed the warnings to several of his neighbors because he knew they would stay on his side - he was only a simple business man to them.

These immigrants had left Europe to flee persecution, but were unfortunately experiencing it in American, as well, where they thought they would be escaping it. Anti-Semitism was normalized in the U.S. by the 1800s, just like racism towards African Americans had been. Since the Jewish immigrants had a greater opportunity to be educated in Europe and African Americans did not have as much of a chance to be in the U.S., white citizens were very threatened by the Jew's existence in their country and thought they had a greater potential to take jobs from them, and therefore intervene in the business world and the economy. The first large scale movement against the Jews and other minorities was in 1852 in the organization of the Know-Nothing or American Party, whose creed could be summed up in two words: Americanism and Protestantism. This party, however, quickly split once it entered the world of politics. Stern's group was reminiscent of the American Party's ideals. Though the Anti-Semitism that the Jewish immigrants faced in the U.S. was a serious issue, it was not as widespread and enduring as the racism felt towards African Americans. Stern's clan was a precursor to much more radical and powerful groups, like the Klu Klux Klan, a group advocating white supremacy, which emerged in 1915. Clearly, forcing his prejudice and racist group out of the parish of Tangipahoa was not a solution to the problem and was direct foreshadowing of the horrors to come.

Cotton would be grown on the West Feliciana plantation, while sugar would be grown on the one in Iberia Parish. Approximately five hundred workers were expected to work on these plantations, which is roughly half of the amount of convicts in the state. All of the crops produced from these plantations would end up going to the state, helping to pay for road construction and the like. The program was expected to enact extensive prison reforms after the convict lease system had been abolished.","Convicts working on plantations in Louisiana were characteristic of a productive penalty system that had been taking place in the South for the past 40 years. After the emancipation of slaves in the thirteenth amendment in 1863, farmers, businessmen, and anybody who had used slave labor in their homes needed to find other people to take their place and keep their lives in order. At the same time, many state penitentiaries realized that they could use their prisoners, who were generally black males, to their benefit - having them work for the state. The Convict Lease System, which was put into place throughout the South quickly after slavery had been abolished, was a method of aiding previous slave owners in maintaining their pre-abolition lifestyle and helping the state pay off the cost of prison administration. Farmers and businessmen needed to find replacements for their lacking labor force and convicts were the perfect solution. People using convict labor would then pay the state for their work. This example of convict leasing is especially unique because the state set aside plantations of its own for the prisoners to work, as opposed to leasing them out to private owners. The convict leasing system proved to be very profitable for the government and any business owners who utilized it. Revenues from the program contributed to over 300% of the costs of prison administration. Not only would convicts work on plantations, they would also repair roads, maintain farms, and do other work similar to that of a slave's. However, states slowly phased out of this method of penalty. The system was frequently abused because the convicts, who were mostly African American and male, were readily available and treated inhumanely, similar to the way slaves had been treated before emancipation. Southern states slowly phased out of using this system and it was finally dismantled in 1928."],"display_date":"December 4, 1900","search_date":"1900-12-04","locations":[{"id":5786,"lat":30.8801785658,"lng":-91.420930249,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3636,"title":"A Race War Results in Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"6/10/00","end_date":"6/10/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In June of 1900, a young white man by the name of Marler was murdered by a black man, Pritchard, in West Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After Pritchard killed Marler, he returned to shoot the dead body repeatedly. The citizens of the parish were infuriated by the situation. Pritchard fled to the swamps. However, other black men had taken up the quarrel for him, and a conflict took place between armed white men and armed black men. Several of the African American men were beaten with a horse whip, and one of them, who showed fight, was shot and killed. After the quarrel, another African American man who was a prominent figure in the ordeal sent letters to two of the white men involved telling them to leave Baton Rouge immediately or face the consequences. The following morning, his dead body was found hanging in a tree; he had been lynched and killed. The situation was looked upon as very serious and armed enforcers with ammunition were sent to control the conflict.","Race riots such as the one that occurred in Baton Rouge between the black and white citizens were not uncommon in the South in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the twentieth century. Southern race relations had not yet mended after the Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863 which freed all slaves, and the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, officially abolishing slavery. In an attempt to replace the social controls of slavery, the Black Codes were enacted in 1885 which greatly limited the rights of blacks, and stated that if they were unemployed or homeless, they would be charged a fine or imprisoned. The Codes were done away with after reconstruction, but many were nostalgic for them and the ideals that they represented.  The Jim Crow laws were created shortly after, in 1877 to racially segregate the South. Though the conflict between the whites and blacks of Baton Rouge was reported to have resulted from the murder of a white man by a black man, the anger between the groups was obviously based on more than the murder. Race riots had been occurring for the past 50 years, and would continue to occur for the next 60 years because of unstable race relations in the South. In 1866, 35 African American men were killed in a race riot in New Orleans. In the same year, there was a similar race riot in Memphis Tennessee. In the summer of 1919, there were 25 race riots in the South. They occurred frequently and often resulted in lynching. Between 1882 and 1968, 4,743 people were lynched, 3,446 of them being black. Though the conflict between the residents of Baton Rouge may seem to be the product of one event, it is actually the result of years of hostility between races in the South."],"display_date":"June 10, 1900","search_date":"1900-06-10","locations":[{"id":5773,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"WEST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3637,"title":"A Mayor Improves Baton Rouge\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the summer of 1899, Robert A. Hart, the mayor of the city of Baton Rouge in Louisiana, along with a small band of progressive citizens persuaded local property owners to approve a sequence of bond issues in order to improve the area. One of the issues cost 200,000 and paid for a new city hall, a new school, and paving of certain roads. Other issues went towards making new schools and hospitals and improving drainage systems. Hart's ability to cajole property owners into approving these bonds is commendable because the citizens of the city were infamously stingy with their money, especially in taxing themselves. Part of the funds from the bonds went to pay for a black public school, as well, which was a decision that the citizens were not aware of, and were not happy with. While African American children had been attending a segregated school in the area, they had never received an improvement, and the white people of Baton Rouge did not want them to have one.","Racial segregation in schools and other public systems was customary throughout the United States during the nineteenth century. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 involving the segregation of railroad passengers, racial segregation was deemed constitutional as long as the facilities were separate but equal. The Supreme Court did not acknowledge the fact that most of the facilities in the country that were segregated were not actually equal. However, one of the Supreme Court justices, Justice John Marshall Harlan, favored the rights of African Americans as guaranteed. Harlan protested that the separate but equal decision was an expression of white supremacy, would stimulate aggression and hatred between the races, and would perpetuate a feeling of distrust. Schools weren't the only areas being segregated; hotels, toilets, parks, bars, schools, hospitals, even telephone booths, and separate sections in libraries, restaurants, and move theaters were being segregated, as well, the latter often with separate ticket windows and counters. There were also laws prohibiting inter-racial sex and marriage, which is known as miscegenation. African American schools were required to have African American teachers and administrators, while white schools were required to have white teachers and administrators. White citizens would naturally be enraged if they found out that a black school was getting an improvement that their school was not receiving. However, schools for African American children rarely saw improvements, much less through a bond issued by the mayor. Hart's improvement, therefore, was unique in the South and revolutionary in the changes that it suggested.

W. deBree wrote a letter to her father to tell him some distressing news. Her letter detailed a very melancholy circumstance that very nearly occurred on a ship bound from Norfolk, Virginia to New Orleans, Louisiana. Thirty slaves who were passengers on the ship had form'd a plot...to murder all the passengers and crew except two sailors who [were] to steer them to St. Domingo. Luckily, one of the slaves leaked the information to the servant of one of the passengers who informed her master of the plot. To take precautions against the possible uprising, the slaves were put in irons for the remainder of the voyage.

Denmark Vessy's slave insurrection plot in Charleston, South Carolina would not be uncovered for another two years. Furthermore, Nat Turner's rebellion was nearly eleven years later. However, the fact remained that white Southerners lived in fear of a slave rebellion as long as slavery existed. The brutality of an institution like slavery would certainly only breed a rebellion just as brutal. This was the white Southern nightmare. To Ms. deBree, this story was a close call, a near realization of the nightmare. "," An interesting point drawn from the letter was the slaves' intention to sail to St. Domingo following a successful takeover of the vessel. St. Domingo, or modern day Haiti, was a sort of utopia in the minds of American slaves. In 1804, a violent slave revolt in the small Caribbean country had resulted in the creation of an independent black nation.

The newly implemented Poll Tax Qualifications eliminated their ability to do so. The total amount of white men that registered to vote was 102,723 against only 1,147 registered African American men. What was true of the state as a whole was equally true of individual parishes, as well. Fifteen parishes reported less than ten African Americans were able to register to vote. There was even only a single black man registered in the parish of St. Charles. The poll tax cut down the African American vote by roughly 130,000 men. Only about 35,000 whites had allowed themselves to be disenfranchised by the poll tax laws either because they do not value the ballot, or because of neglect or carelessness.","The voting situation in Louisiana in October of 1900 was not unique to this state alone. The Poll Tax Qualifications required each person registering to vote to pay a tax for their vote. The origin of the implementation of the poll tax rests in the development of the Populist Party of the 1880s and 1890s in the Southern United States. The Populist Party demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of the railroads, a tariff for revenue only, the direct election of U.S. senators, and other measures designed to strengthen political democracy and give farmers economic parity with business and industry. The Populists in the South gave the Democrats the only competition they had seen in the polls since the end of Reconstruction. The competition became so intense that both parties pushed for African Americans to be able to vote in the election so that they could have their votes. However, the Democrats won, and when the Populists were defeated the Democrats implemented various laws into their state constitutions in order to disenfranchise the African American voter. After payment of a poll tax was made a pre-requisite to voting, very few blacks had enough money to pay for it, along with impoverished white citizens, thus eliminating their ability to register to vote. This poll tax lived on for several decades, until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964 declared poll taxes unconstitutional in all states. The large disparity between black voters and white voters in Louisiana, therefore, was common to southern states in 1900 because of the disabling poll tax."],"display_date":"October 19, 1900","search_date":"1900-10-19","locations":[{"id":5666,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3648,"title":"Settling the Debts of Robert Riddick\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-12-13","end_date":"1827-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 13, 1819, Joseph Prentis took over as the Executor of the will of the late Robert M. Riddick of Nansemond County due to the death of the named executor, Thomas Swepson. Mr. Riddick's will called for the disposal of his estate for the payment of his debts. However, Riddick stipulated that in order to raise the deficiency [the Executor was] fully authorized and requested to mortgage the lands and to hire out the slaves for the purpose. For the next eight years, Mr. Prentis hired out Riddick's slaves to neighboring farmers in order to pay off the debts of the deceased. At the time of his death, Robert Riddick owned eighteen slaves. This number, while not huge, was quite substantial and suggested a sizable agricultural operation. Although, when one looks at Mr. Prentis' description of the slaves and the value he placed on each, one can see that perhaps the number alone can be a bit misleading. ","Of the eighteen slaves Mr. Prentis listed in his account book on December 31, 1819, only six were adult males. Furthermore, of those six only two were considered valued over 300 and one of those, Tom Bray valued at 350, was well past his prime at forty-eight years of age. However, Armistead was valued at 500 because he was only eighteen years of age and presumably had a whole lifetime of labor in front of him. The only other male slave close to the value of Tom Bray and Armistead was a man named Jacob, described by Prentis as a small and weakly fellow forty two years old. The other three men were worthless or close to it. Dempsey, valued at 100, was approaching at fifty-five years old. The remaining two, Mingo and Jimmy, both were appraised at 0. Mingo was around seventy years old and very diseased having lost one eye and nearly blind in the other while Jimmy was about sixty years of age and listed as very decrepit. The twelve other slaves that constituted Robert Riddick's property were all adult females and their small children. Of these there were three adult women appraised at 300 or higher. These three were all between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-nine years old, prime childbearing ages."," Further reading into the account book of Mr. Prentis reveals that he was able to hire out Mr. Riddick's slaves to pay off the late man's debts, as directed in the will. Naturally, the amount received for each slave hired out makes sense when compared to their values listed earlier. In the year 1820, old Jimmy was hired out for only five dollars. The small and weak Jacob fetched 32.50 while fifty-five year-old Dempsey earned thirty dollars. Although much younger than Tom Bray, Armistead was hired out for 34 while Tom was hired for 55. Though one cannot be sure, this was probably due to the fact that the older Tom had some skill that was in demand by his temporary master."," The story of Robert Riddick, his slaves, and the posthumous management of his estate was a common one in the slave-holding South. Southern slaveholders, while wealthy in land and human property, did not have a lot of capital at their disposal and frequently purchased on credit which often plunged them into debt. The death of a slaveholder required that those debts be settled, and often that was accomplished through the hiring out of slaves to raise the money necessary to pay the creditors. This process was time-consuming but it allowed the late slaveholder's family to retain ownership of the slaves that a quick settlement of the estate (i.e. the auction of the slaves) would not accomplish. The amount of time it took to pay off the debts of a deceased slaveholder through the hiring of his slave property could vary greatly depending upon the size of his debts and the sex, age, and physical condition of his slaves. For example, the job of settling Riddick's debts may have taken less time if half of his slaves had been young, healthy males like Armistead. Richard Randolph a Prince Edward County slaveholder discussed in Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, owned a great number of slaves that were to be manumitted upon his death. However, his wife kept them in bondage for a further ten years until the debts could be settled. The fact that slaveholders were willing to wait years to pay off debts through slave-hiring speaks to the value of slave property in the antebellum South. Southerners would rather wait than loose their property forever in a quick sale."],"display_date":"December 13, 1819 - December 31, 1827","search_date":"1823-12-22","locations":[{"id":14070,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3649,"title":"A Shocking Scene\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-08-12","end_date":"1820-08-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The passengers of the steamship <em>Virginia</em> witnessed a shocking scene on the afternoon of August 12, 1820. In fact, the scene was so unnerving and immoral that one passenger decided to write a letter to the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> to express his disgust. The episode began when the steamship happened upon a small boat while traveling up the river near Fort Norfolk. Hearing cries in the wind, the passengers spotted a small boat with a sail set, and a little boy, apparently not more than nine years old, holding the sheet and managing the helm as well he could. When the steamship motored closer to the sailboat, it could be seen that besides the child at the helm, there were two grown persons inside, both apparently lifeless. The one a negro man, laying across one of the seats forward, the other a white person further aft, concealed from view by the sail except one leg which was entirely bare and hanging over the gunwale. Quickly a rescue boat was sent out by the Virginia to find that the two people were not dead but stone drunk, and the person lying with one exposed leg hanging over the side was in fact the white mother of the little boy. The two adults had ingested a bit too much alcohol and had simply passed out in the boat, the black man having given the young boy the helm. There was no real problem until the boat got out into the middle of the river where the wind picked up and the vessel became too much for the little boy to handle. Luckily the Virginia happened to be passing by just in time to save the passengers of the sailboat from a watery grave."," The person who wrote the letter to the Herald describing the event, signed only as 'Q. Z.', expressed his disgust at the scene, saying that it was not proper for a man to be so thoroughly intoxicated. However, the thought of the woman drunk and laid out in so lewd a position was loathsome and shocking. The writer of the letter continued on to comment upon the horrible vice of drunkenness which caused the woman to put not only her life in danger, but also that of her young innocent son."," Though the letter can be read as scathing indictment of the consumption of alcohol, the antebellum South certainly did not have a substantial temperance movement. On the contrary, the temperance movement in the South prior to the Civil War was rather weak, perhaps because of its Northern counterpart's links with abolitionism. Furthermore, as this episode helps illustrate, drinking and drunkenness was not confined only to white males, although they did drink more frequently than did slaves or white females. While Mr. or Mrs. 'Q. Z.' may very well have advocated for the prohibition of alcohol, he or she was certainly not representative of the population at large and probably spoke out due to strong personal religious convictions."," Adding to the shocking nature of the scene of drunkenness was the fact that the white woman was in the company of a black man while splayed out in an indecent position. Interracial activities between white and black men in the antebellum South were often frowned upon, but such relations between black men and white women were outright condemned. The United States at the time was an extremely racist nation and blacks were thought of as being not only inferior to whites but actually subhuman. Additionally, white women were seen as venerable to the perceived hyper-sexuality of black males and were to be protected from their advances at all times. The fact that the white woman in the boat had exposed private parts of her body to the black man, or perhaps even the possibility that she may have been in a sexual relationship with the man crossed the bounds of decency in antebellum America. Q. Z. and the rest of the passengers of the Virginia certainly had ample reason to be alarmed."],"display_date":"August 12, 1820","search_date":"1820-08-12","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3650,"title":"A Request from the American Colonization Society \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-07-07","end_date":"1820-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 7, 1820, the American Colonization Society took out an advertisement in the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em>.

These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":4530,"title":"The Hate Crime In Louisville","course_id":20,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-05-20","end_date":"1857-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The hate crime that occurred in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 20, 1857, was \"one of the most shocking instances of cruelty and of mob violence that has transpired in this country for years.\"   A group of slaves from Louisville had been accused of a crime.  A white jury found the slaves not guilty, which angered a mob of whites who wanted the slaves executed for a crime that they clearly did not commit.  The mob set out for vengeance.  The assembly of whites broke into the jail in which the slaves were confined, and forcibly trudged them through the streets while the slaves protested their virtue and pled for assistance.  The mob ended their fatal rally by cutting the slaves' throats one by one before hanging them from various trees throughout the city.

Following regulations set by the state mandating free black registration, James H. Trufs journeyed to the county clerk's office to register himself. The first entry, which labels Trufs as number one, describes him as a dark mulatto. Included in the description is his age, height, and scars. Trufs had a small scar over his right eye, and a small scar on his left fore finger just below the upper joint. John Henderson Miles, number two, had three scars on the left arm, one of which was occasioned by a fork having been run through his arm. John Longley, number 40, obtained his defining scar by a tomahawk. Number 18, George Rush, who had several of his front teeth in his upper jaw missing, had a large scar on the inside of the right leg a little above the ankle occasioned by a scald. Just as noteworthy as the scars were the free blacks' occupations. The occupations included boot and shoemaker, barber, sadler, cabinet maker, farmers, wagoner, and housewife. Of equal note to the scars and occupations was just how these blacks obtained their freedom. Some were free born like Trufs, while Rosannah and Harvey Hill became emancipated by deed from John McCauley in court. Number eight, who had a large scar said to have been occasioned by a cut with a sickle, was emancipated by the will of Jonus Smyth, of the same name that Smyth County was derived. Number four, Theodore Sterrett, was emancipated by deed from Thomas Findlay. The Virginia General Assembly enforced Robert Craigton's will on March 23, 1836 by an act, which granted Delila Boyer her freedom.","Each piece of information noted by the county clerk was taken down with a certain purpose. The scars served as the defining physical characteristics for free blacks. The occupations showed which jobs black people took versus which jobs required education that they would be unable to hold, such as jobs in the printing industry. Finally, the details of their freedom were taken down to have written record in case anyone ever questioned a free black's legality. In the antebellum South, these records were kept like a census. They were only used against free blacks in the wake of major violence. Only in the immediate aftermath of Nat Turner's rebellion and other rebellions were free black registrations used as a list of possible suspects. Once the anxiety subsided, normal race relations between whites and free blacks resumed in a cordial state. Either way, there was a basic need to identify free blacks precisely. In the case of a rebellion, whites needed to know who their enemies were, and in the case of peace, whites needed to keep tabs on who the leaders of black society were for trading purposes and for maintaining race relations.","The information taken down for the records emphasized a stratified society. Blacks, on many of the entries, were not even given names, but were merely assigned a number to differentiate themselves. Furthermore, whereas whites were defined by their status, blacks were defined by how many scars they had and where they had gotten them. It seemed likely that some scars were the mark of white masters when the free blacks were slaves or just a consequence of racial tensions turned violent, because the descriptions of some of the scars seemed almost impossible to have occured naturally.","The very act of registering blacks displayed black inferiority. The very law that required free blacks to register at the county courthouse marked them as inferior in status. One of the aims of the free black registration law was to monitor the movement of free blacks between localities. White people had to make sure that the free blacks did not feel they were too free. The white lawmakers who instituted the law made sure that where the free blacks were free, they were not really free. Whites barred them from the rights and symbols associated with freedom, because the law presumed that all blacks were slaves, so free blacks had to have documents proving their freedom. Free blacks had to walk around with free papers, which they might have to show at any time. The entire concept of registering free blacks in Washington County reflected the inequality that existed for free blacks in southern society. Black people had to undergo so many obstacles that whites imposed on them in order to maintain safety within society. The free black registration underscored a large theme of complex race relations in the antebellum South, even for an activity that was done without violence."],"display_date":"March 26, 1838 - July 28, 1856","search_date":"1847-05-27","locations":[{"id":14341,"lat":36.7495375423,"lng":-81.8835070546,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3666,"title":"The Virginia Census of 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The composition and make-up of Virginia was complicated and had changed since the last census, so the editors of the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>, Norman Miller and George A. Porterfield, published the 1850 census of Virginia in March 1851. It showed the free white, free colored, slave, and total population in each county of the Commonwealth Virginia. As the census broke down the Virginia population into the Trans-Alleghany, Valley, Piedmont, and Tidewater regions, the people of western Virginia who read the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em> rejoiced in their growth.","One thing is clear for the region: whites always outnumbered the combined number of free blacks and slaves. Other than that, the Appalachian region was varied in its proportions. Kanawha County had the largest slave population (3,140) in the region with black people, including free and slave, making up 22 percent of its population, while whites made up 78 percent. This was a county with one of the largest disparities between free and enslaved. Pulaski was 71 percent white with 29 percent black. Likewise, Greenbrier, Washington, Montgomery, and Wythe had large black proportions with 15 percent to 20 percent black. In contrast, Barbour County's free black population (214) outnumbered its slave population (113), and the county had a substantial number of whites (8,682), having 96 percent white population. Scott, Wood, Lee, and Brooke Counties also shared a large white population ranging from 92 percent to 97 percent. Most common, however, were counties where the free black population stayed in the low double-digits, while the slave population was substantial, such as in Pulaski county, where there were 3,612 whites, 32 free blacks, and 1,470 slaves. In counties like Pulaski, the large proportion of slaves showed interesting developments in the social climate.","The white population in the mountain region was the highest in the state, surpassing the tidewater, piedmont, and valley regions with 331,568 total whites. The proportion of whites in the Trans-Alleghany region was 92 percent, which contrasts sharply with the proportion of total whites in the entire state, which was 63 percent. Meanwhile, the black population in the Trans-Alleghany region for both the free black population and the slave population was the lowest compared to other areas in Virginia, being 2,482 and 24,436, respectively. ","Slavery had already been prevalent in the Appalachian South, but in 1820, there were large slave concentrations in Kanawha and Greenbrier counties in western Virginia. Over the following 30 years, as these slave communities grew, other places in Appalachia remained void of slavery, such as Jackson County, Kentucky. There was no denying slavery's impact on Appalachia. There were regular slave markets including one in Bristol, Virginia, where slaves could be sold down river if necessary. At the same time that slavery was expanding, antislavery followers moved into Appalachia. In 1827, 106 of the 130 antislavery societies in the nation were located in the South, with a heavy concentration in the Appalachian Mountains. What the Census of 1850 showed was that Appalachia was made up of varied counties. Appalachia had counties where there was a large number of slaves and free blacks, and at the same time, it had counties where there was virtually no black population. Regardless of individual county analysis, Appalachia on the general scale was white. The white population seemed to be concentrated in the Trans-Alleghany Valley, as the white population for that region was 92 percent while the proportion of whites throughout the whole state was 63 percent. Since the Trans-Alleghany Valley contained only 25 percent of the total population in Virginia, it seemed like white Virginians concentrated in Appalachia. This could possibly have been due to the antislavery movement, although it is more likely that the movement was for pursuing land and religious culture in Appalachia."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":14654,"lat":38.3892987778,"lng":-81.5023034378,"zoom":8,"place":"KANAWHA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3671,"title":"Reconstruction and the Ku Klux Klan \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-02-12","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Hamilton W.

In the years following the war, however, he settled down in Andersonville, Georgia, and sought to spread political voice to freedmen. His intentions were motivated by a humanitarian desire to assist the freedmen adjust to their new lives. His efforts at ensuring the enfranchisement of blacks did not go unnoticed, however. On February 12, 1869, a letter was waiting for Pierson when he arrived at his home. Adorned with a skull and cross bones at the top, it addressed him as Sir. Pierson was called a vagrant carpet-bagger and a scoundrel of the deepest dye for maliciously interfering in the political realm of the town. The threatening letter was from the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan warned him to stop his efforts at enfranchising blacks and leave the region immediately. If he failed to comply with their demands, they threatened to kill him. The letter concluded by stating that Congressional reconstruction, the military, nor anything else under Heaven could protect him should he decide to not abide by the group's orders.","Upon receiving the threatening letter from the KKK, Pierson left Andersonville and traveled to the nation's capital, Washington D.C. While there, he wrote a letter to United States Senator Charles Sumner detailing his experience. In addition, he included descriptions of various acts of violence against black citizens in the South, and demanded that they be addressed and punishments be enforced. In 1870, Congress passed the Force Acts to help end the violence and enforce the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the Constitution.","The KKK was a secret society created during the Reconstruction era to intimidate blacks and white reformers. The white-supremacist group employed terrorizing methods towards individuals usually associated with the Republican Party. Northerners were often associated with the Republican Party by southerners. This elucidates the connection between Northerners and the term carpetbaggers. The term carpetbagger was used as a derogatory reference for northern whites who moved to the southern states during Reconstruction. They were often viewed as exploiters who were taking advantage of the economic, social, and political conditions of southern society for their own personal gain. Members of the KKK blamed the Republicans for overturning their social order and imposing restrictions on southern whites who had supported the Confederate war effort. They burned black-owned buildings, and terrorized and killed freedmen who tried to exercise their right to vote in elections. Unfortunately, their efforts were usually successful. However, due to the efforts of reformers such as Pierson who demanded that the government take action, the KKK gradually faded away."],"display_date":"February 12, 1869 - December 31, 1870","search_date":"1870-01-21","locations":[{"id":2224,"lat":32.0399997503,"lng":-84.1970888963,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3675,"title":"Chastisement of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-11","end_date":"1864-06-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Emma Mordecai was enjoying the pleasantly cool weather when a very disagreeable affair concerning the servants disturbed her afternoon.

All of a sudden he heard a noise high above him in the sky. The boy looked up and saw two enormous birds swooping and stabbing at each other. They began to get closer and closer to the ground until they completely fell out of the sky and landed right beside him. In complete shock, Pompey did not move a muscle but continued to stare at the birds next to him. Their talons seemed to be wedged in each others flesh. Then, the birds took off into the sky. A couple of minutes later, they again fell to the ground beside Pompey with their talons still wedged in each others bodies. The boy began to approach the wild birds, and without hesitation threw himself on top of them. After struggling with them for some time, Pompey managed to snap the necks of both birds and successfully killed them. He then proceeded to carry them to Mr. Cragwall who quickly identified the birds as Bald Eagles ","This story of Pompey and the two Bald Eagles, published in the Richmond Whig, illustrates a very important idea and concern not just among southerners but among all citizens of the United States. The writer of this story, H.R.P. saw the incident as a direct representation of the current struggle between the two Unions: The battle in the air, is the strife destined to take place between the two great sections of the Union. Pompey represented his own ebony race, slipping in upon us while engaged in mortal combat, and wringing the necks of both. H.R.P. was also very shocked at how many people drew the same conclusion from this series of events. His story illustrates the fact that many people could have predicted the Civil War that would take place almost thirty years ahead this time period. ","Alexis de Tocqueville expressed the same prediction as he said, I shall refuse to believe in the curation of a government that is called upon to hold together forty different nations. They would not be able to avoid ideas of ambition and rivalry, and therefore would eventually have to split. In <em>The Impending Crisis</em>, David Potter states that Tocqueville's prediction was based, fundamentally on a recognition of the disruptive and intractable nature of slavery. When Pompey and the African American race intervened in the already heated struggle between the two Unions, they raised the issue of slavery, complicated the situation tremendously, and drove both sides to the brink of war. Pompey's story shocked many people in Virginia and gave people insight into the crisis that lay ahead.

They wrote to him, saying that they were currently residing in Toronto. Their letter did not include, however, stories of happiness and joy in the free world. Instead, the slaves told Mr. Lake of their overwhelming desire to come back home to his plantation. They expressed their regret for leaving him, and wished that they had never run away in the first place.

In Slavery in the Cities, Richard Wade states that Free Negroes in the cities [lacked] the money required for medical care, and, had the highest mortality rates of any urban group. Many struggled to find jobs and a place to live while free in the North and were still being treated as inferiors.

","The lack of human dignity in the slave trade was confirmed through advertisements such as this. The cold description of slaves for sale is disturbing because the worth of the individuals centered on how well could he/she serve a new master. The historian Walter Johnson, in his book Soul by Soul, argues that selling children was common and done without concern about breaking up families. This narrative supports with Johnon's portrayal of the slave trade; it was inhuman and even included children without regard to how that may affect families. ","Moreover, the adjectives used are equally revealing as to the attitudes taken by slave owners. When trying to sell slaves, no bad adjectives were used but rather adjectives that make a slave seem to be more valuable. To many people who traded, slaves were just another account entry. In order to determine appropriate prices, however, categories were established by traders who had knowledge of what a slave might be worth. Even paradoxically, slaves were treated well prior to being sold in order to fatten them up and make them seem to be healthier; a healthier slave earned more in return. The appaling treatment of people in the slave trade cannot be overstated."],"display_date":"April 12, 1850","search_date":"1850-04-12","locations":[{"id":11628,"lat":34.811393256,"lng":-82.9187403935,"zoom":9,"place":"PICKENS, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3700,"title":"Twelve Years a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-02","end_date":"1853-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The memoirs of Solomon Northup vividly portrayed the descent of a former New York freedman into the harsh system of slavery faced by many African Americans living in the antebellum South. Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3704,"title":"The Changing Nature of the Institution of Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-03-12","end_date":"1857-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

A seat of racial tension, particularly because of an established African American population that controlled many prestigious government and military positions, Hamburg had undergone nearly eleven years of Reconstruction that had, in the opinion of South Carolinian Sam Aleckson, brought some \"tranquility to the state and people.\" Nonetheless, the success of Reconstruction (especially in Hamburg) was blemished when a white Ku Klux Klan mob assaulted a black militia group led by South Carolina National Guard Captain Doc L. Adams. ","    At the time of the incident, Adams' regiment had been parading legally on the streets of Hamburg in celebration of the Fourth of July. Two white men, Messrs. Henry Gatzen and Thomas Butler, approached them and instructed them to move to the side of the road, which they did begrudgingly.

Adams. This action Mr. Butler carried out in accordance with South Carolina law. The second action Mr. Butler took, however, was much less lawful. Butler related the stubborn response of the militia company to his cousin, General M.C. Butler (an ex-Confederate general and a participant in Ku Klux Klan activities), who took the law into his own hands, demanding that the militia company turn over its legally-held weaponry as well as summoning an armed mob from Augusta, Georgia, to assault the black National Guard regiment.","    Soon after, Butler's mob forced the militia men into a local house and threatened to blow up the house with cannon fire.

Owned by a wealthy family in Kentucky who sent him to Virginia for a brief period of time, Watts awaited the opportunity to return home with his son for over a year.  During his time in Campbell County, he \"lost\" his wife and daughter as well as most of his financial viability.  Unable to afford the price of the journey back to Kentucky, Watts wrote to Brown to ask for more money.  He expressed concern about the dissolution of his family, mentioning the state of a fellow slave mourning the sale of his son to another plantation owner.  Yet Watts also made use of his time away: he visited friends of the Brown family, fulfilled his slave duties, and also tried to find a new wife.  Family played an important role in the lives of slaves, but slaveholders could easily break a family apart.","            In the 1830s South, slavery was an institution valued as a source of economic wealth and production.  When it became financially advantageous to sell a slave, or when a slave became an economic burden for his or her owner, the majority of slaveholders had few reservations for selling their slave to someone else.  Historian Wilma A. Dunaway notes that despite a strong emphasis on the family as an emotional and physical support in plantation culture, masters \"devalued the human characteristics of their slaves\" in order to justify breaking up slave families.  While it is unclear how Watts lost his wife and daughter, the urgency he expressed at the thought of losing his son reflects his fear of existing without a family.  ","            Yet Watts also knew of the potential danger in saying too much to his mistress.   As John Blassingame writes, slaves often held back much of their emotion from their masters for fear that their masters would take advantage of or chastise them.  Throughout his letter, Watts flattered his slave-owning family and made them aware that he fulfilled their orders while in Virginia.  The fact that he reserved a place in his letter to ask that his family remain together highlights the immense importance of kinship and the ease with which it could be shattered.  Watts' gender also played a major role in the probability of separation from his son.  Mothers rather than fathers were more likely to remain with their young children because it increased the chance of their children's survival.  Thus, despite his distance from Kentucky and his possession of a small amount of money, Watts knew that he was still at the mercy of his masters.  His experience as a slave was even more difficult because he was a father."],"display_date":"December 3, 1837","search_date":"1837-12-03","locations":[{"id":13697,"lat":37.2395751117,"lng":-79.0668919579,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3840,"title":"A University of Virginia Student Responds to John Brown&#39;s Raid\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-11-03","end_date":"1859-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    E.M. Healy, a student at the University of Virginia in the years surrounding 1859, wrote a letter to his brother in Urbanna, Virginia on November 3.  He was eager to explain to his family an event that had occurred a short distance from where he was in Albemarle County, Virginia. On the morning of October 16, 1959, John Brown, a radical abolitionist, and 17 white men and five African Americans attacked the government armory and railroad bridge at Harpers Ferry, Virginia.  They hoped that they would not only raise a slave revolt, but also provide their black followers arms from the arsenal in order to escape safely.  Even though Brown and his group were able to quickly take possession of the armory, they were unable to create the army of slaves that they had anticipated and had truly hoped for. ","    This raid obviously created great concern with the citizens of Charlottesville, Virginia because as Healy says in his letter, they felt as if they did not fulfill their job of protecting nearby Virginia citizens.  If they had had a sufficient military force, they could have aided Robert E. Lee's troops and ceased the attack more quickly.  Therefore, only five days after John Brown was found guilty of murder and treason, the people of Charlottesville scheduled a mass meeting in order to increase their military force.   Healy and many other students found it necessary to attend the meeting. This meeting, however, still seemed to be a very drastic measure compared to reactions across the South.  As Reynolds says, people in other states, at first, simply decided to always be armed individually in case of another abolitionist attack.  It was necessary for Virginians to take more immediate precautions because of the actions of Virginia's governor Henry Wise.  He was the one to quickly arraign Brown on three charges: murder, inciting slaves to rebellion, and treason against the state of Virginia.  Wise wanted to make a statement, and by claiming John Brown for the state of Virginia, he did.  So, in turn, Albemarle County responded quickly and efficiently to the Harpers Ferry events and stood up for the state of Virginia. ","    If John Brown had been killed during the raid, Albemarle County and other Southern counties would have taken these previously stated precautions less seriously, but this was not the case.  John Brown had a period of seven weeks between his being found guilty and his execution.  During this period, he was able to talk and write from jail; so, by the time of his death the entire nation knew of his writings.  He was no longer simply a criminal, but a martyr in the North, and a representative of the abolitionist reform to the South.  The South was then paranoid and in a state of panic.  Their views of secessionism and defense of slavery strengthened.  They were more rigid when dealing with their slaves, and all Southern states realized they should be prepared, like Virginia, with sufficient force in case of another foolish abolitionist raid.  Today, historians see John Brown in many cases as the man who truly provoked the first events that would in turn lead to the Civil War.

His work with the Freedman's Bureau led him to buy a farm in Manassas, Virginia so he could be nearer to his offices in Louisa, Albemarle, and Orange Counties. He worked often to secure the individual rights of freedmen that many white southerners worked to undermine. Not only did white Southerners try to oppress the freedmen but the orders of the U.S. Army to their soldiers were often oppressive as well. While working in the Louisa County courthouse, Hopkins noted in his array of cases laid before him on January 13, 1868 that the \"freedmen are being outraged and swindled to about the extent that such an ignorant stupid and yielding subservient class would be anywhere else.\"","    The South under Union military rule was almost as hard as life in slavery for the freedmen. The Union soldiers were ordered to arrest \"vagrant\" black men in the cities and to remove them to the countryside to work on plantations, assuming they were too \"lazy\" to work in the cities. Historian Eric Foner notes that General Weitzel, the U.S. Army commander at Richmond, had \"ordered that before receiving assistance, whites take an oath of loyalty and blacks sign labor contracts,\" forcing the freedmen into essentially a less glorified version of slavery for the sake of the South's economy. The soldiers carried out the harsh orders of the U.S. Army lest they face the consequences of desertion: death.

A freedman incarcerated on charges of theft and intoxication was trapped inside a burning jailhouse. Villagers called out to Toombs to help save the building and Hopkins recorded Toombs to have replied, \" '[d]amn the buildings save the man' \" Toombs ran into the burning prison three times, attempting to break the lock with an axe, and on the last try smashed the hot iron lock and released the prisoner.

Morehead from Guilford County, North Carolina presented the petition to the Senate. The Senate received the petition a few days before its adjournment.  The Western Carolinian Newspaper reported the petition to the general public on January 17, 1839.  The journalist from the Western Carolinian did not write positively about the abolition attempt, and was shocked that the movement was happening \"at home.\" ","    A petition to Congress about slavery was very common at this time.  Congress was force to issue a gag rule to end the constant debate about anti-slavery petitions.  The major issue however, was that the Quakers pushed this petition from a very prominent slave owning state. Quakers were very vocal about their religious beliefs against slavery, which sometimes got them into a lot of trouble. The Quakers strongly upheld the idea that all men are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers also felt the need to obey the law and be moral citizens.  However, these two conflicting beliefs did not stop the Quakers' fight. Many Quakers, such as Nathan Mendenhall, were active in the manumission society.  This was a society that Mendenhall and his fellow Quakers created in attempt to set up new areas in Liberia for freed slaves to live.  Other Quakers owned \"freed slaves\" to keep them from being resold into slavery, worked directly with the Underground Railroad, and were active in court cases dealing with possession of slaves. Due to this obvious protest of slavery, Quakers faced many conflicts with their slave-owning neighbors.    Quakers received harsh treatment and persecution for their actions as well.  These problems caused many Quakers to flee to the new frontier.  The majority of the Quaker population ignored their neighbors' resistance and continued to fight slavery from within North Carolina.  Although the North Carolina Quakers were a peaceful and moral religious group, they still played an important role in the abolition movement from their location in a slave holding state.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

Of all the slave rebellions in the United   States, this revolt led by Nat Turner was perhaps the most infamous. Turner's violent rebellion capitalized on one of the plantation class's greatest fears: insurrection. Campbell, in his letter to Colonel Baldwin, detailed the revolt's aftermath, noting \"the whites murdered amounted to fifty-eight\" and that \"excitement and apprehension\" had consumed Virginia. Over the course of two days, approximately seventy slaves, including \"eleven of Richard Drummond's Negroes,\" terrorized the white citizens of Southampton County. In order to comprehend the significance of the Southampton slave insurrection, it is necessary to first understand the brooding concerns of the Southern planter class.","A slave rebellion, argues historian Marion Kilson, \"expresses the realization of the worst fears of the slavocracy.\" Due to plantations' significant dependence on slave labor, an Eastern Virginian county comprised of a larger slave than white population was not atypical. The Historical Census Browser shows that according to 1830 census figures, the population of Southampton County contained 7,756 slaves and 6,573 whites. Because slaves were regarded by the white minority as a form of chattel property that could be bought and sold, potential for uprising was-ever present. Whenever violent rebellion did emerge, Southern sentiment punished the entire slave population in hopes of re-establishing confidence in the traditional plantation economy.","As a direct result of the Southampton slave insurrection, the Virginia General Assembly instituted strict legislation further assuring white social control over free and enslaved blacks. Historian Scot French writes that the Assembly \"banned blacks from preaching or attending unsupervised religious gatherings,\" while Harvey Wish notes that the Assembly strengthened the \"police codes of the slave state[s].\" Wish further observes the fact that because Nat Turner was an educated black, \"Negro education became more than ever an object of suspicion.\" Panic regarding future conspiracies encouraged trials and convictions of many slaves for alleged plots that never materialized.

It was here, in Columbia, that the federal court attempted to provide serious solutions to stunt the organization whose actions had become increasingly violent and oppressive. While these actions by the federal court and the infamous nature of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina created controversial issues in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the \"reign of terror\" by the Ku Klux Klan was temporarily immobilized by token arrests in 1871. ","The Ku Klux Klan planted their roots, under emissary R.J. Brunson in 1868 in Rock Hill, S.C. The Democrats, hoping to win back governmental positions in South Carolina, felt that by intimidating and eliminating the \"negro Republican vote,\" victory could once again belong to the Democratic Party. In Abbeville County, for instance, the secretive, violent actions of the Democratic Party went hand in hand with the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, working together in most cases. In the presidential election year, South Carolina was anticipated to have won steadily Republican seats, but instead, intimidation triumphed democracy.","The violence exploded in the elections of 1868, as Abbeville, Newberry and Anderson counties were entitled \"the KKK counties\" because of the armed mobs and murders that occurred on Election Day as white supremacists employed violence to ensure political upheaval. One Southern man claimed that they [white Southern Democrats] were being \"trodden under foot by an inferior and barbarous race.\" But by 1870, the Democrats could no longer depend on intimidation to win elections and the emergence of the more militant KKK continually gained momentum, primarily for Democratic Party political gains, and of course, in the name of white supremacy. When 2,500 armed whites gathered in Laurens County to violently protest the election results in 1870, violence spread among the upstate of South Carolina. Negroes were pulled out of jail, beaten and murdered by white supremacy members of the KKK. In York County alone, in the course of six months, there was an estimated 304 incidents of violence. Klan violence, though the Klan had been officially disbanded in 1969, arose out of all socio-economical classes in a decentralized format, reigning terror and death wherever possible. The federal government, under Grant in late 1870 and early 1871, respectively passed the Enforcement Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act hoping to put an end to the once again rebellious South through these increasingly strict federal acts. Because of these acts, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in nine South Carolina counties and in most cases, the procedure of due process was neglected.","The trials, evidenced by Evans Murphy's questioning during one aspect of the ongoing South Carolina trials, proved mostly ineffective and as support waned, largely futile. In the South Carolina KKK trials alone, an account collaborated by the federal government in 1873 discovered that 831 persons were indicted and only 27 of which were ruled guilty, 71 persons pled guilty, and by 1875 pardons released the last of the imprisoned KKK members and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was passed in early March. Under the Klan's \"virtual reign of terror,\" however, much violence and terror was accomplished. But those who were caught and testified in court, such as Evans Murphy, created an environment not easily conducive to convictions. Evans claimed \"[he] didn't see anything [himself], [he] didn't do anything [himself],\" and \"[he] didn't hear anything\" about the night he was said to have been one of nine members in a beating at the Rainey house. Yet, as the questioner so succinctly stated, \"so it turns out that those who happen to be indicted didn't do anything, and all those that haven't been caught, did the whipping.\"  And with that testimony, Evans Murphy, like the other token Klan members convicted, was fined one hundred dollars and imprisoned for eighteen months, in order for South Carolina to put an end to Klan violence and grant South Carolina peace. The story of Evans Murphy provides insight into the South Carolina Ku Klux Klan trials, which temporarily shattered the Ku Klux Klan and reinstated temporary law and order, only to have the organization emerge once again in the 1920s, more violent than ever."],"display_date":"December 28, 1871 - March 1, 1875","search_date":"1873-07-29","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3912,"title":"Early Support for a War in Missouri\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-07-13","end_date":"1855-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 13, 1855 in Lexington, Missouri, there was a convention held to rally support for the continuance of slavery in the United States. At that convention James Shannon gave an address entitled \"Domestic Slavery,\" in which he attempted to justify the practice of slavery and disprove the validity of the reasons given by abolitionists to outlaw the practice. The reasons he gave in support of slavery covered a broad spectrum, typical of the Southern justification of slavery. He cited Bible verses that in his mind showed that slavery was condoned, even encouraged, by God himself. He predicted economic catastrophe in not only the southern United   States, but the entire country, if the slaves received freedom. Shannon estimated the value of slaves in the United States at over two billion dollars, a huge financial loss in the event of emancipation. He attempted to refute claims about the immorality of slavery by arguing that the slaves actually benefited from American slavery, saying that under the guidance of the white race the Africans learned how to be civilized. In his conclusion he suggested that once \"all peaceable means to protect our rights, and save the Union\" were exhausted, \"we will stand to arms,\" and \"God will defend the right.\"","            Shannon's arguments for slavery were typical of the rhetoric used by pro-slavery forces in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Southerners believed that they were justified by the law and by God in their practice of slavery, but Shannon's remarks went beyond simply justifying the practice of slavery. Even in 1855, half a decade before the first state seceded from the Union, the idea of secession from the Union was common among Southern pro-slavery forces. The aggressiveness of the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed outlawing slavery in all the land acquired during the Mexican-American War, caught the attention of Southerners. Shannon was among many others who thought that preemptive action was necessary to stop Northern politicians from outlawing slavery. This early support by Southerners for secession and acceptance of violence as a necessary step in order to protect the right to slavery made the American Civil War seem inevitable, even five years before the first shot was fired."],"display_date":"July 13, 1855","search_date":"1855-07-13","locations":[{"id":7668,"lat":39.0656247172,"lng":-93.7855117112,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3914,"title":"Opposition to Freedom\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-31","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On the last day of 1889, an editor of the <em>Roanoke Daily Times</em> criticized \"the relations of the races,\" which, he avowed, \"do not appear to be at all improved by the election of a Republican president.\"  The editor continued, affirming that black people had \"become restless and arrogant in a large measure, and ready at any time to enter on the work of bloodshed and murder.\"  This was not the case under the presidency of Democrat Grover Cleveland, who assured justice and contentment for all black citizens, the editor argued.  While this editorial in the New Year's Eve edition of the <em>Times </em>was brief, it nevertheless emphasized that blacks were still a threat to society, especially under the administration of Republican President Benjamin Harrison.  Moreover, the editorial highlighted growing white backlash in Virginia against the rights that African Americans gained following the Civil War. ","            Numerous reasons explain why the editor of the <em>Times</em> criticized Harrison's administration and the situation of black Americans.  Harrison took office in 1888 having defeated Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat.  Running on a platform of \"Rejuvenated Republicanism,\" Harrison received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Cleveland, and he alienated strongly Democratic areas of the country as he took office in 1889.  Additionally, his support for black civil rights and his appointment of Frederick Douglass as a foreign minister to Haiti further angered his opposition.  Cleveland, on the other hand, had supported returning captured Confederate flags to former Confederate states and had expressed federal appreciation of Confederate soldiers.  Harrison's failure to engender support from Democrats and former Confederates resulted in the 1892 re-election of Cleveland in the most decisive presidential election in 20 years.","            The advancement of civil rights legislation that followed the Civil War was a source of opposition to black citizens.  Historians Nancy Bentlen and Sandra Gunning write that after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, \"African American men were suddenly free to enter local and national government during Reconstruction.\"  Philip A. Bruce's publication of <em>The Plantation Negro as a Freeman</em> in 1889 reflected growing white opposition to black freedom.  Characterizing black men as immoral and rebellious, Bruce \"devoted a great deal of time to writing Southern history that directly aided and abetted the post-Reconstruction backlash against African Americans, arguing that as they moved beyond slavery, blacks were inevitably devolving into barbarism.\"  ","            Both the administration of Harrison and the advancement of black rights that took place after the Civil War and Reconstruction gave rise to this editorial.  Its criticisms and fears reflected those of white Virginians across the state, many of whom were staunchly Democratic and still loyal to the former Confederacy.

He conveyed his deep desire to have President Cleveland attend the Lynchburg Fair in October in order to rescue Virginia from falling into the hands of the Mahoneites and out of the hands of the Democrats.  McDonald continued on in his letter to list the various means by which the President could arrive in Lynchburg and depart in a timely manner.  He even stated that he could easily extend the date of the Fair so as to accommodate Cleveland's schedule.

The movement aimed to lower state debt by enacting liberal reforms, including broadening education opportunities for black citizens.  Gaining the nickname \"the party of the Negro,\" the Readjuster Movement won a degree of support in the early 1880s for its financial policies.  Additionally, Mahone sought alliances with Republican officeholders in order to gain more political salience.  Pleas like that of McDonald arose, therefore, out of Democrats' fear of Republican and Readjuster control of state-and even national-politics.

In Lynchburg, former Confederate General Jubal Early avowed, \"the Negroes must know that they are to behave themselves and keep in their proper places.\"  McDonald believed that staunchly Democratic Cleveland was an effective counterbalance to the Readjuster movement, and he therefore attempted to feature him as the central figure in Lynchburg's 1887 Fair."],"display_date":"August 22, 1887","search_date":"1887-08-22","locations":[{"id":13702,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3925,"title":"African American Spies in the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-09-14","end_date":"1863-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Stokes climbed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the 4th South Carolina Cavalry unit while serving for the Confederate Army from January 1862 to April 1865.

Specifically, he noted a number of occasions in which his regiment came in contact with both African American soldiers in the Union Army and slaves. In one such episode, Stokes learned that a small group of enemy soldiers, including eight armed blacks, had been tapping their telegraph wires near Green Pond, South Carolina. Stokes and his men soon pursued the party and managed to capture three of the black spies.

Due to the racial divide, black troops also experienced unfair treatment for much of the war. Although few blacks directly participated on the battlefield, the Union Army employed many behind the scenes as scouts, raiders, or spies. They provided a significant contribution to the war effort.

The removal of a student from the Academical  Village over a slave whipping was difficult for many to believe since whipping was a common disciplinary action for misbehaving servants.  Confusion mixed with curiosity lingered throughout the grounds.  ","            In late April 1856, W.D. Clarke, a student at the University of Virginia became particularly agitated after seeing a young slave girl chase a flock of pigeons onto the grounds of the University of Virginia.  After chastising and threatening the girl with a whipping, Clarke approached the slave's master to inform him of the child's misconduct, expecting prompt disciplinary action.  To his astonishment, the master chose to disregard the girl's actions and Clarke's anger, telling Clarke to leave the young slave alone and go about his day.

Clarke beckoned the young slave girl to his living quarters and proceeded to discipline the girl himself, beating her until she became unconscious and  bringing her within inches of death.       Clarke's violent behavior angered the University of Virginia community.  Many felt that his actions negatively represented the community of scholars and that his actions should be evaluated by the faculty, a common practice at the University for any dishonorable act.  Clarke went before the faculty board, who reviewed his actions.  On May 3, 1856, the faculty board voted that Clarke's actions were inexcusable, requiring him to withdraw immediately from the University.  ","            Almost one full day later, Clarke responded to the faculty's decision in a letter requesting the board to reconsider its final verdict on his case.  Clarke acknowledged that his actions were dishonorable, however, he also wrote that he could have justified his actions with \"sufficient representation.\"  Days later, the faculty board at the University  of Virginia decided to rescind his withdrawal.  ","            The actions of W.D. Clarke and the response of the University of Virginia were particularly characteristic of the accepted social behavior of the slave South during the mid-nineteenth century.  A racially tense white society regularly scrutinized the behavior of slaves<strong>.  </strong>Masters would routinely discipline slaves who acted inappropriately.   Furthermore, it is also important to recognize the social implications that would result from disciplining a slave owned by another master during the nineteenth century.  It was considered illegal to discipline another master's slaves because slaves were the master's private property.    Clarke's defiant and violent behavior toward the young slave girl and the University's response exemplified the gravity of such actions in areas where slavery was a significant aspect of society.

The writer's real name was Reverend Julius J. Fleming, a prominent and outspoken citizen of Charleston widely respected for his roles as a preparatory school principal, a Methodist preacher, and earlier in his life, as the editor of the <em>Sumter Watchman</em>, a Charleston area newspaper. More importantly, however, the editorial Fleming penned shows a distinct knowledge of the fundamental problem that plagued Reconstruction South Carolina.","In the editorial letter that he penned in the <em>Courier</em>,<em> </em>one of dozens that he would write during his lifetime, Fleming addressed many problems that the Civil War had laid on South Carolina. In particular, Fleming's message also posed two significant queries relevant to the safety and survival of Southern culture: \"How can<em> </em>peace and quiet be permanently secured?\" and \"How and where will farmers find an adequate, reliable labor force?\" ","Interestingly enough, both of Fleming's questions hinged on one all-important aspect of Southern lifestyle, the slave labor agricultural system that had existed for nearly two hundred years at the time of the Civil War. Fleming, in his editorial, described slavery as \"the life-blood of secession and the real <em>casus belli</em> [cause of war],\" thereby showing that slavery's end was to be the single largest hardship faced during Reconstruction. On this note, he claimed that \"by one sweep the wealth of the country is taken away, and a people accustomed to wealth and ease are suddenly reduced to poverty, humiliation and toil.\" Fleming's idea of South Carolina's economic ruin as a result of emancipation was later supported by Civil War historian W. Scott Poole, who cited the disappearance of \"enormous wealth, founded as it had been on a now defunct social system.\"","There is no doubt that both questions Fleming posed were difficult ones to answer, especially considering the Union Army had freed a gigantic number of former slaves during their march through South Carolina. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the author developed several sensible answers to uncertainties faced not only in South Carolina, but the South as a whole, in his landmark editorial. Among these suggestions, Fleming's envisioned arrangement for agricultural change was particularly impressive, and featured a version of sharecropping in which wealthy planters would \"divide up a portion of their estates into small farms which emigrants can readily obtain by purchase or lease.\"  In the post-war South, Fleming's system was put to use on a large scale, and it lasted into the twentieth century. ","Across his editorial, Fleming displayed an acute knowledge of the problems to be faced as the result of slavery's demise in post-Civil War South Carolina. While there is no question that Fleming's editorial addressed on one hand \"a people picking up the pieces of an existence shattered and changed by war and defeat,\" there is also no question as to the overarching theme of his letter.

However, throughout most of Lunsford Lane's experience as a slave, he worked as a \"body servant and waiter in his master's fine mansion\" and did not suffer the toils of fieldwork.  In fact, he seemed to appreciate living in North Carolina because he said there was a constant fear of being sold to the Deep South, where slavery was harsher.  As soon as Lane discovered the possibility of buying one's freedom, he set to work, night and day.  He began selling peaches and marbles whenever he had the chance and eventually sold prepared smoking tobacco and pipes at fifteen and ten cents each, becoming known as a tobacconist around town.  He worked and went into town to sell his products late at night and early in the morning, living an exhausting lifestyle.  Lane eventually married, and had six children, and raised 1,000 dollars to purchase his freedom.

He had finally achieved a dream that he believed would change the lives of generations of young African Americans.  Yancey had overcome the obstacles of racist sentiments and segregation that were a widespread aspect of life in Albemarle County, Virginia. ","    Benjamin Franklin Yancey traveled to Albemarle  County in the early 1890s with a dream to educate African Americans.  He began fundraising projects to raise money to build a school on a former plantation in Scottsville,  Virginia.  Yancey firmly believed that a school for black youths would provide them with the skills they would need to move up in society.  However, as Yancey worked to create such a school, he faced numerous obstacles.  Particularly, the racial tensions that existed in Albemarle  County towards the end of the nineteenth century delayed Yancey's fundraising progress.  However, Yancey worked to overcome these obstacles and he eventually opened the doors to one of the first black schools in central Virginia, naming it the Esmont Colored  School.  Yancey, along with his wife, ran the school and taught young African American children basic skills such as reading and writing.  ","    During the post-emancipation years, African Americans faced great disadvantages in education.  These disparities, which began during slavery, continued into the era of Jim Crow, when black children were forbidden to attend school with white children.  \"Separate but equal\" schools were legalized in 1896 after the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson </em>ruling, however, the schools for black students rarely equaled those for white.   Blacks often faced extremely uncomfortable conditions and less than mediocre education.  In response to reports of these conditions, many educated Americans became active in the effort to educate freedmen.  Several individuals, like Benjamin Yancey, devoted the rest of their lives to the education of newly freed black Southerners.  As a result, schools for freedmen were rapidly being erected across the South.   These individuals embodied the ideals of Civil Rights activist W.E.B.

Historian Thomas Wertenbaker asserts that medical knowledge in the antebellum South was rudimentary at best.  Especially in rural plantation societies like Virginia and Maryland, doctors were hard to find, and even if found they were not always likely to be consulted.  Many in the South believed that doctors did more harm than good, which is probably true considering their widespread use of such treatments as bloodletting and their lack of knowledge concerning germ theory.  In this light it is understandable why Perkins did not hold out much hope for Betty's survival.","      According to F. N. Boney, a number of Southern doctors in the antebellum period performed medical experiments on slaves.  Doctors used the prevailing belief that blacks were inferior to whites to justify the often grotesque procedures to which they subjected slaves.  They performed many experiments, including the trial of a new (and highly dangerous) vaccination procedure and even an effort to discover an effective surgical method for sealing clefts that caused bladder leakage.  Slaves endured unimaginable pain and suffering due to such atrocities, but in the doctors' minds it was all in the name of science.  Regardless of the means through which discoveries were made, medical science in the antebellum South left much to be desired.  Concepts that are considered self-evident today, such as germ theory, were unknown at the time.  Perkins described most of his traveling as such: it \"...was water Bound three times and was very mody....\"  Frequently surrounded by water and mud, his traveling party must have come into contact with an untold amount of pathogens.  Although these days it is viewed as common knowledge, many people in the antebellum South may have had no idea that such conditions could be breeding grounds for disease.

He stated simply, \"I acknowledged their freedom; did not expect them to work on the old terms, but would pay them for their labor, etc.\" Pinckney respected the knowledge of the land and agricultural work that these men had acquired while working for him, and for this reason he wished them to stay on his plantation. After his request, Pinckney received a largely negative response from these former slaves. Acknowledging their rights as free men, Pinckney told them that if they were to stay on his land they would have to work for him, but they were free to go wherever they wanted. The slaves found themselves in a frustrating bind. Fearing the failure of the federal paper currency (greenbacks), they wished to work for themselves instead of Pinckney employing them. They questioned the actions of the government, asking \"what good does it do for the government to give us our freedom and not give us land to plant?\" Pinckney, probably like most former plantation owners, was equally frustrated because his livelihood relied on the productivity of his plantation, and he could not possibly do all the work himself. ","    The free men did begin to work, but \"it was only starvation that brought them to it.\" Without any land, they could not provide food for themselves or their families, so they had to work under whatever conditions Pinckney offered. On Pinckney's plantation they were \"generally forced to adopt the share system.\" This share system became common throughout the South in the years following the war. In the early stages, the plantation remained the most common unit with free men working on it for a share of the crops, but soon enough a true sharecropping system developed. Black men were granted pieces of land to work, and when the year was over the owners returned to them a share of the crop produced. By 1870 sharecropping was so common in the South that it made any other system seem unusual. Sharecropping did not, however, allow the South to develop any more industry or diversify any more than it had under the plantation system, leaving it lagging far behind the North for many years to come."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3951,"title":"Southern Ladies\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-06-12","end_date":"1889-06-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    In an 1889 letter to her close friend, Mrs. Hannah Weisiger described her late mother as \"one of the noblest & dearest women on earth...so much good...yet so humble...of her good deeds.\" Throughout the nineteenth century, Southern women were idealized as the moral compass of the family, supposedly gentle and noble in deeds. Even in the latter part of the century, values firmly rooted in the pre-Civil War plantation culture remained prevalent. Mrs. Weisiger described her mother's virtues with special reverence as a woman whose life encountered many changes throughout the war and reconstruction years and yet still maintained her dignity as a Southern lady.  She declared her mother \"was as near right as any human could have been.\" Women who were born after the reconstruction era learned feminine ideals from their mothers, who passed on what it meant to be a lady.","    The \"southern lady\" idealized  femininity by subscribing to traits such as \"sweetness, beauty, gentleness, and ease...while remaining feminine, submissive, and sweet to the man who was her husband...\" This occurred while caring for all domestic functions of the household, which included providing clothing, preparing food, providing moral and religious guidance and to administering to the sick. Although slavery instituted household demands on a pre-war plantation wife that were very different from that of a post-war southern wife, women were still expected to fill the same role within the family with or without the duties of managing a contingent of household slaves. Slavery provided southern white women an opportunity to embody certain leisurely ideals from a public view.

Being sold to the Deep South was possibly one of the greatest fears of many Upper or Border South slaves. The prospect of being sold away from family and friends was considered by some, a worse punishment than whipping. ","            According to historian William W. Freehling, economic growth, booming land sales, and the invention of the cotton gin encouraged the interstate slave trade as cotton was very profitable and grew more productively in more tropical climates. Freehling also notes that \"between 1790 and 1860, Border and Middle Souths lost close to 750,000 slaves.\"  This drain was especially prevalent in the 1850s cotton boom, comprising a substantial percentage of the slave population of these states. In comparison, after the \"tobacco bust of the eighteenth century,\" the Border South was much more industrial, grew a wider variety of crops, and was more economically diversified and willing to sell their slaves \"down the river\" for a high profit. Most slaveholding southerners claimed to look down on these slave traders who made transactions possible, but according to historian Jeanette Keith, Isaac Franklin and his partner John Armfield were two of the most affluent and successful slave traders in the United   States. They later retired wealthy, purchased their own plantations, and married into elite families in Tennessee. They were also prominent Methodists. Many factors encouraged the slave trade during the 1820s and 1830s. Economics and profit to be gained in the cotton boom provided ample reason for traders to invest in this market.

He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.  Unfortunately, though, with the turn of the century, Edward Ayers notes that \"blacks in the south paid for schools for whites--not the other way around.  The more black citizens in a county, the greater the benefits to white students.\"  Racial tensions would not disappear for some time."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":13600,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3958,"title":"To Protect and Serve: Overlooked White Crimes\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-09-03","end_date":"1890-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The black woman was badly injured.

He focused his attention on an innocent black woman who seemed out of place in the area.  After questioning the \"suspicious\" woman, Policeman Saunders decided to arrest her.  The woman resisted the seemingly unwarranted arrest and the result was bloodshed.  The police officer brutally beat the woman over the head numerous times with his billet.  As news of the savage beating spread throughout Charlottesville, individuals of the black community banded together, demanding that the officer be tried for excessive and unjust force.   The demands of justice by the black community were ignored by the white politicians and the police officer went unpunished.  ","            Black inferiority was an uncontested aspect of the South during late 1800s.  The failure of Reconstruction allowed blatant racism to become an accepted part of the Southern states.   Whites often used violence to instill fear in the minds of black Southerners in an attempt to regain the level of control which they had prior to the Civil War.  This rampant violence and widespread fear shaped and defined the relationships between blacks and whites during the late nineteenth century.   To remedy this overt discrimination in the Southern states, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which made it illegal to discriminate against blacks by assigning them an inferior legal and economic status.  Approximately two years later the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing \"equal protection of the laws\" to every American citizen.   In response to this legislation, however, the Southern states passed a new set of laws that \"permitted local officials to informally discriminate against blacks.\"   The actions of the Southern states following national legislation indicate a desperate effort to retain a position a position of superiority over newly freed black Southerners.  Unfortunately, the desperate attempt to maintain a sense of white supremacy in the South resulted in the disappearance of any form of legal justice in the black community.  The absence of legal action against Policeman Saunders is just one example of the widespread acts of injustice which plagued blacks across the United   States following the abolition of slavery.

His cotton crop had failed and his debts were quickly mounting.  In an 1843 letter to his brother, who lived in Staunton, Virginia, Kinney proposed multiple methods to earn some quick money to satisfy his debtors.  The most promising option was to begin actively engaging in the slave trade.  Young healthy slaves could often sell for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  The recent migration of planters to the Mississippi Delta from the Chesapeake region had increased the demand for slaves even further.  Even some people from the North came to the region in order to enjoy the economic prosperity of the area.  Some of the migrants came not understanding slavery or even believing that it was unnecessary but ended up purchasing slaves nonetheless.

This is interesting because his brother, as a resident of Virginia, likely owned slaves himself or was at least exposed to slavery on a daily basis.  In fact, many slaves from Virginia and Maryland were sent to the Deep  South where the demand was much greater for them.  This was because the tobacco boom had come and gone in the Chesapeake while the cotton and sugar rush was just beginning in Louisiana.  The struggling farmer told his brother that the slave trade \"is both a positive good for master and slave.\"  It is easy to see what \"positive good\" the master received, but Kinney failed to mention how this process was beneficial to the slave.

Advertisements present in the Norfolk-based newspaper attempted to sell goods such as Christmas supplies, hats, and chlorine tooth wash. While these impersonal objects were goods commonly traded and sold in the marketplace, the advertisement section also included references to Southern property that had run away from their masters. Perhaps the most telling aspect of these advertisements was that no significant distinction was made between missing cattle and missing slaves. To the slave master, steers and slaves were equal under the nature of the law: both were fundamental illustrations of private property. ","To comprehend the importance of the <em>Beacon's </em>advertisements, it is essential to understand the Southern belief that slaves were inherently the property of their masters. This prevalent reasoning had predated the Constitution and was deeply entrenched in Southern culture by 1832. Records from the debates of the Constitutional Convention, presented in the <em>Cambridge Modern History</em>, illustrate that Southerners held a consensus that \"slaves were property only; like other property, they were entirely subject to the wills of the master.\" This conception was no different from the perception regarding steers. In the two advertisements aforementioned, the descriptions of the missing cattle and runaway slaves relied solely upon physical peculiarities. While the two missing steers had \"marks under half moon under the right ear,\" the runaway slave named Lucy was \"stout\" with a \"very yellow complexion.\" In both circumstances, vested rights in private property possessed by the plantation owner dictated that the property be returned. ","The Southern perception of slaves as \"chattel property,\" mirrored in the two advertisements of the <em>American Beacon</em>,<em> </em>supports an underlying observation that blacks and cattle held equal rights under <em>de facto</em> Southern law. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"chattel\" is defined as \"a personal possession.\" As previously stated, slaves in the South were considered \"property...subject to the wills of their masters.\" The words \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" share a common language origin; both terms come from the Old French word \"chatel,\" which arises from the Latin word \"caput,\" meaning \"head.\" By relegating slaves to the restricted rights and properties of chattel, slave owners fundamentally equalized the rights of slaves and the rights of cattle. As a result, listing rewards for runaway slaves next to advertisements for runaway cattle, chlorine tooth wash, and medical elixirs was not conflicting in either intention or theory.  ","From expressed Southern mentality and advertisements found in the <em>Beacon</em>, it becomes readily apparent that blacks and whites were not regarded as equal beings under the encompassing mantle of equal protection. Blacks, bought and sold as mere chattel, were only regarded as equals to steers, \"glass beads,\" and \"harmonical walking canes.\" The subsequent equality under the law and inherent relation between steers and slaves was a founding principle of the Southern plantation economy, helping preserve the institution of slavery until the conclusion of the Civil War.

We will be pleased to know that the unpleasant matter is settled.\" ","On December 30, 1885, Phillip Haxall, President of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, penned the preceding sentences in a letter to Chairman William H. Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency.

W. Parmalee, a South Carolina businessman, maintained close correspondence with an individual by the name of \"Wheeler\" in a series of letters spanning from 1848 to 1850. One topic of interest evident in Parmalee's letters was politics, with a particular focus on the sectional tension between the North and South. Parmalee's commentary on the sectional crisis echoed the sentiments shared by many Southerners at the time. \"We are, as a people, in a state of considerable political excitement,\" he wrote of the Southern attitude. Parmalee then went on to discuss Southerners' desire for \"equal rights under the Constitution,\" a fundamental principle that Congress had, in his opinion, violated. He also addressed the divisive issue of slavery that had begun to wear at the ties of the Union throughout the 1840s and 1850s.","Parmalee argued that \"slavery as it exists in the Southern states is as benevolent an institution as there is within our [country].\" Southerners at the time made this claim to defend the institution and way of life they were fighting to protect as a means of civilizing and humanizing the black race. Furthermore, the South was an agrarian society, and slavery, many believed, was vital to maintaining the prosperity of that agricultural economy. It had been deeply rooted in Southern culture for decades, and the recent rise of the abolitionist movement threatened that lifestyle both economically and socially. Southerners justified the institution of slavery on historical, Biblical, racial, and moral grounds. Parmalee's opinions from his letters also reflect the paternalist interpretation of slavery and the widely held belief in the South that \"slavery was a necessary institution of social control.\"","Paternalism was the relationship between slave and master based upon the idea of reciprocal duty and the acknowledgment of the slave as a human being, rather than just property. It established a mutual tie between the master and the slave as an individual. Under this system, masters also felt a greater sense of responsibility to care for the livelihood of their slaves.

Reed's journal entry certainly proves this, for she observed the frightening picture of \"an innocent, peaceable negro all thought, taken from his frightened wife, taken out, his house searched, and (then) he was shot and left lying in the street the next morning.\" All this occurred due to the vengeance of a lynch mob operating in the town of Anderson, yet according to a traumatized Reed, \"no [citizen] knows who perpetrated the dark deed - nor for what reason - all excitement.\" Such occurrences of racism were not only common during early Reconstruction, but would also continue to appear for quite some time in South Carolina and across the South, proving that many whites in the region remained \"strongly committed to white supremacy.\"","     Reconstruction in South Carolina and in the rest of the former Confederacy was meant to turn the tides of racism and inequality that had been entrenched in the region for nearly two hundred years. In the long run, this racism would die out. Nevertheless, early Reconstruction strayed far from its purpose, a tolerance and freedom meant to apply to <em>two</em> races for the first time. More accurately, early Reconstruction efforts led to a southern culture of racial despair and hostility, one considered by Emmala Reed to be \"a horrible, disorganized state of society.\""],"display_date":"June 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-08","locations":[{"id":11429,"lat":34.519117434,"lng":-82.637883414,"zoom":9,"place":"ANDERSON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3988,"title":"Black Code in Mississippi\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-12-11","end_date":"1865-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A small article on the front page of <em>The Natchez Democrat</em> on December 11, 1865, described a conflict between state militia and black freedmen almost two weeks earlier.

However, the men of the South did not agree with southern women.  They believed that women were not suited for politics, as it was seen as unfeminine.  Nevertheless, southern women continued to work towards the vote through reform efforts and conventions - the first being the Women's Rights Convention in South   Carolina in 1870.

Mary Boyden became used to seeing her father discipline unruly slaves, but this time she became disgusted with his behavior.","            Before Mary went to sleep on the night of January 3, 1857, she wrote in her diary as she did every night.   Normally, Mary would write about the weather and the people she had met throughout the day.  This entry, however, had a particularly different focus. Mary began this entry with the thought, \"another day has dawned upon this sin polluted earth,\" followed by an emotional, detailed description of the brutal whipping of a slave that she had witnessed early in the day.  Her father, an overtly bigoted, violent man, had senselessly beaten a slave in an attempt to solidify his superiority over the less-than-human slaves who worked on the plantation.  His futile actions had disgusted Mary, a religious adolescent girl who tended to sympathize with the slaves that her family had owned.  Mary had developed a substantial internal conflict between her personal ideals and the beliefs encouraged by her Southern Baptist religion.

She did not agree with the idea of slavery and wrote, \"white folks will have to pay for making slaves of the black folks, in the insurrection.\"  Mary no longer wanted to experience the routine whippings of the slaves, whom she had developed close relationships with.  She longed for a way to remove herself from the life that her family was so deeply imbedded in.   ","            Conflict between religion and slavery was not an uncommon dilemma in the slave South during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War.  Many deeply religious slave owners were even troubled by their own involvement with slavery.  Some slave owners who were particularly religious considered the institution of slavery to be evil and were often convinced that they would be going to hell.  However, Southern Christian churches often supported the idea of slavery.   Religious communities considered the institution slavery in terms of its social, political, and economic consequences as well as in terms of its ethical implications.  The majority of the religious communities, however, feared that emancipation would lead to devastating effects.   Slave owners used the views of their churches as a foundation to rationalize or justify their own involvement in slavery.  As a result, many slave owners considered slavery an economic and political issue that was beyond their control and ignored the ethical issues surrounding the institution.  Mary Boyden embodied this internal conflict which existed between her own ethical beliefs, her religion, and her family's use of slaves to bring in revenue.  This conflict proved to be a crucial weakness for many southerners fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

Charles' abrupt disappearance enraged his master, John C. Kerric. On November 22, 1851, Kerric wrote an impassioned letter to his friend, Robert T. Hubard, describing his unfortunate situation. Kerric explained that Charles ran away and was purchased by a plantation owner on the \"other side of the mountain.\" He questioned the legality of this man's purchase and asked Hubard to seek legal advice on the situation from a presumed lawyer and friend, Benjamin Graham. Also, Kerric sought to defend his social standing as a good master, proclaiming that he had established a decent house for his slaves and could not understand why Charles ran away.","After receiving Kerric's letter, Robert Hubard immediately initiated correspondence with lawyer Benjamin Graham. In his reply, Graham spoke first of the legal ramifications associated with the purchase of a runaway slave. Graham declared that a man's slave is his property for life, so Kerric still legally owned Charles. Graham also argued, however, that he understood why Charles had run away, explaining that Kerric was a \"cruel and harsh\" master. Even more, Graham defended the plantation owner who purchased Charles, complimenting his \"good plantation and content workers.\" Hubard relayed the lawyer's message to Kerric, and Kerric decided it would be best to sell Charles and end his trouble.","During the years preceding emancipation, planter society highly valued the ideal of paternalism. According to historian Drew Gilpin Faust, \"paternalism is the belief in a sense of stewardship, where some men are divinely appointed to be the guardians of others, justifying slavery as a positive good.\" The ideals of paternalism instructed masters to treat their slaves as a father would treat his child. Paternalism instigated a system of mutual obligation between slave and master; where slaves who were treated well were expected to act obediently. Most southern planters reasoned that in caring for slaves, in leading them out of barbarism, they were fulfilling God's will.","The correspondence between John Kerric, Robert Hubard, and lawyer Benjamin Graham illuminates many of the fundamental principles of paternalism. Drew Faust explains that paternalism was a social response to the South's obsessive fear of slave insurgency, seeking to control blacks as individuals and a race. The fear of slave insurgency, as in Kerric's situation, motivated many planters to take an interest in their slaves' well being. In the eyes of Kerric's community, his misfortune was warranted because he treated his slave harshly. The letters also illustrate that men who exercised paternalism were granted a certain level of respect. In his letter to Hubard, Kerric expressed deep fear that neighboring planters would cruelly criticize and judge him because of his slave's disappearance. Graham heightened this point by complimenting Charles' new<em> </em>master for his \"good plantation and content workers;\" insinuating that he might have been a better fit master than Kerric. Overall, paternalism provided an ideological and emotional context in terms of which individuals approached slavery and within which they legitimated their consequent social actions."],"display_date":"November 1851","search_date":"1851-11-15","locations":[{"id":13889,"lat":36.6763018346,"lng":-77.5590329782,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENSVILLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4004,"title":"Reconstruction Brings Important Social Changes for Former Slaves\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/06","end_date":"12/31/06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The first great expansion in African American higher education came after the Civil War during the Reconstruction era.

Two white male adults, presumably acting as professors, stood before the African-American student body.

In the ad, Andrews discussed his willingness to negotiate with Virginians who wished to \"send their Negroes to Texas, in farming there, from one to ten years... and divide the net profits on just and equitable proportions.\" It seemed as if Andrews was attempting to start some type of business or partnership with slave owners in Virginia, and the tone of his writing alluded to the idea that his plan was one that had been implemented and been successful among other agricultural entrepreneurs. Andrews' proposition illustrated the desire of those residing in the new frontier lands of the Southwest to make both slavery and agriculture profitable in an area that many people hoped would become the new South. Just as it seems that John Andrews had done, in the years following Thomas Jefferson's acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, many Americans began moving west into the frontier in hopes of gaining more land as well as finding the agricultural success that many plantation owners had found in the American South. Settlers began stretching across the midwestern section of the United States into areas such as Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. Although many do not generally associate slavery with the Lone Star state, it was a very large institution in the region.

I will do so.\" In the early 1840s, people began to realize that Texas served as a great source of rich soil for farming and attracted the attention of upper South slaveholders such as Andrews. As the years went on, it became evident that slavery was going to be a very large part of the growth and prosperity in the new state.

As this happened, the \"violence had a profound effect on Reconstruction politics\" and produced a \"demoralizing impact upon [the African American] communities.\"  As the violence towards African Americans increased in the South, they became much less likely to not take the opportunity to vote or run in elections, which further destabilized the basic foundation of power that had just been established with the beginning of Reconstruction.  This destabilization of the base of political power for African Americans would be critically harmful to their ability to secure their physical security in a society where the white people in power blamed all of the larger problems on the advancement and freedoms of African Americans."],"display_date":"April 1, 1877","search_date":"1877-04-01","locations":[{"id":9845,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4040,"title":"James Brady: Chronicles of a Devoted Businessman on the James River\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-05-08","end_date":"1832-07-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By the waning sunlight, a fairly young merchant by the name of James Brady poured his eyes over a financial document.  It was proof that his business relations with an associate, William Tompkins, Sr., had finally bore fruit.  Mr. Tompkins waited over three years to pay James Brady for debts dating back to May 1829.  The large quantities of bacon, corn, nails, and planks had accumulated into a bill of 65.61, no small sum.  Brady let out a sigh of relief.  With this money he could expand his investments into the booming slave trade, which was far more lucrative than five hundred nails at 4.37.  James Brady became a fairly active slave trader, handling not a few transactions in the 1840s and 1850s, due to diligent effort but also to exterior factors. ","With the acquisition of lands of the southwestern frontier from the Creek Indians, Mississippi and Alabama were states by 1819, expanding the influence of the Slave South.  Between this and the ability of the cotton gin to enable a profit from lesser-grade, short-staple Southern cotton rose to the nation's top cash crop by 1830.  Due to the increase in demand for labor and no legal slave importation, deep Southern planters turned to Maryland and Virginia to supply labor.  Merchants like James Brady came into the picture here, buying and selling slaves for a profit on a route between Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.  According to Michael Tadman's <em>Speculators and Slaves</em>, states with large populations like Virginia exported slaves to the expanding southern cotton and (in Louisiana's case) sugar states.  When the international slave trade ended in 1807, dependence on states like Virginia grew greatly, leaving traders like James Brady in a position to turn quite a profit.  Treating black people like property, individuals such as James Brady separated children from their mothers, endearing dealers to no one North or South. ","Looking over his financial records and personal letters, James Brady was no Simon Legree, the evil slave trader from Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  James Brady kept thorough financial records and took advantage of a business opportunity.

He was also one of the extremely few African Americans in the South who owned a substantial amount of property before the Civil War.  Now, seven and a half years after Appomattox, John Adams was dead.  Sensing its approach, he filled out his will on January 8, 1873, just six days before his demise.  In his will, before laying out his possessions, he stated that he wished his debts to be paid.  Everyone immediately swooped in on John's son Joseph, the new holder of the Adams estate.  Barely a month after the loss, a mister Samuel Adams, with the leverage of a justice of the peace, forced Joseph to cover a debt of 73.50, rather paltry in light of the Adams family's wealth.

Bacon, a writer for \"The Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery\" published a statistical pamphlet in 1859 reflecting African American advancements in the nation's first capital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He acquired the statistics by examining the number of blacks associated with particular institutions. Bacon hoped to illustrate his belief that African Americans, just like white men, women, and children could enjoy the rewards of economic progress if given the opportunities of every citizen. The introduction of the new liberties and opportunities provided a chance for growth among the members of the black population in a time which faced great segregation and racism. ","The overall culture of Philadelphia in the 1830s through the 1850s rewarded many blacks who witnessed a new era of political ideology. During this time the city established new liberties such as access to a variety of schools for their children, decreased numbers in convicted persons, and also increased opportunities in mechanical trades. The new possibilities provided a foundation for greater achievement and acceptance into the dominant white culture that encompassed the United States. ","African American children received new opportunities to attend public, private, and reformatory schools. The schools had been refurbished to provide an improved atmosphere for learning. The education efforts afforded to many of the African American students is undeniably associated with Protestant reform. Perhaps one of the most prominent schools for black children was the House of Refuge for Colored Children, established in Philadelphia in 1850. Walter Trattner, a twentieth century scholar, expressed the popular opinion shared by many whites in the North during this time period: \"…in an attempt to cope with the disturbing social and economic conditions and to restore a sense of community to urban America, moralism succeeded benevolence, public aid and private charity were transformed into mechanisms for social control\". The foundation of this school allowed young African American inmates to move out of prison and into reform schools.","The level of tension between races may also be witnessed within the labor market. In 1838, the number of occupations made available to African Americans spanned across 134 categories in Philadelphia. In these categories, 997 consisted of African American workers. Historian Cecil Frey pointed out that in the late eighteenth century the slaves and free men were encouraged to participate in mechanical trades which increased competition between black and white communities. The encouragement did not last long, and according to Benjamin Bacon a majority of the workers within the trades were forced to desert their trades because of increased racial prejudice throughout the city. Few exceptions existed in this community; James Forten, being one of them, was still given boundaries to stand within regards to his 'natural' status. ","The most significant numbers revealed within the pamphlet seem to portray an ambivalent step towards leniency in African American sentencing. The proportion of white men versus African American men in the Philadelphia county prison switched from an equal level in 1835 to almost three white men to one black man in 1858. Willliam J. Mullen, a prison agent, stated within the pamphlet, \"To myself it seems the above list shows the conditions, moral, and civil, of the colored race, to have greatly improved within the last 23 years, and to be far higher at this moment than it was at the commencement of that period.\" At quick glance this assumption seems to be true, but as mentioned previously, the decline in number of African Americans in prison can also be attributed to the opening of the House of Refuge for Colored Children, which took the children out of prison and put them into reform school."],"display_date":"1835 - 1839","search_date":"1837-07-01","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4049,"title":"Frederick Douglass and his dream to escape\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"I was only a slave; my wishes were nothing, and my happiness was the sport of my masters.\" During Frederick Douglass's life he experienced separation from his family, the death of both an old friend and his grandmother, and his escape from slavery. In his early twenties, Frederick Douglass was sent to Baltimore to serve a farmer named Captain Antony, but after Captain Anthony's death his future was unknown. Sent away to be valued along with the rest of the Captains' property, Douglass had visions of never seeing his family or his home city of Baltimore ever again. In his memoir, he talked about how the lives of cattle and swine were viewed equally with those of African American descent. This was a common feeling shared by many other slaves at the time. Despite both his sadness and humiliation, Frederick was overjoyed when he was informed that he was now in the possession of Mrs. Lucretia, the daughter of his previous master, and was going to see his family again in Baltimore. ","Frederick talked about how Mrs. Lucretia had taken care of him since his early childhood and was one of the only white Southerners whom he could trust. Within a few months of living with Mrs. Lucretia, Frederick Douglass was faced with another hardship, as he found out that she was deathly ill and was going to die soon. This now meant that all her possessions, including both Frederick and his grandmother, had to be auctioned off to a new farmer. Frederick's inability to know where his home was was a very common feeling shared by most slaves during the nineteenth century. ","The constant trading and buying of slaves was a hard fact that many slaves were forced to deal with in Baltimore during the nineteenth century. The only way to ensure that families would be reunited was to pay the Masters. When slaves became free, some owners would allow males to buy back family members who had been separated from the family. In <em>The Slave Narrative</em> one slave was given the opportunity to buy back his family from their master. 'At the end of the first year, plans were made with his wife's mistress for the purchase of his wife and two youngest children. The owner fixed their price at eight hundred dollars and gave him twelve months in which to raise the money.\" This was the only way that freed black men could guarantee that their family would not be sold somewhere else. Being able to reunite with separated family members helped many African Americans get through the troublesome years of the nineteenth century.

At this point in Douglass's life he worked for Mr. Freeland, and even though he considered him a friend, the idea of being enslaved his entire life gave Frederick the drive to escape. It was the beginning of 1836, and Fredrick thought about all the years he wanted to escape but never took any action. He decided that this year was going to be different; instead of thinking and dreaming about freedom he was going to make it happen. \"The thought of only being a creature of the present and the past, troubled me, and I longed to have a future-- a future with hope in it.\" Frederick and five other slaves devised a plan to escape on the following Saturday. His memoir takes the reader into the mind of a slave as he described the anxiety that the six of them faced leading up to the escape. The night before, they could not sleep because of the fear of what would happen if they got caught. They had all dreamed about escaping before but the next morning it was actually going to happen. On the morning of the planned escape they went about their normal duties in the field and right before they were going to run away, everything changed. Somehow word had gotten out about their plan and the six of them were confronted by Mr. Freeland along with six other men. Frederick knew that Sandy, one of the slaves who was going to escape with them, betrayed them out of fear. This shows how even though many slaves dreamed of freedom, the idea of being caught stopped many from taking action. The fear of what could have happened kept many African Americans enslaved during the nineteenth century. This would not be Frederick's last attempt toward freedom.","Many years after Frederick Douglass' escaped slavery he was still being sought after. In <em>The Slave Narrative</em> it talks about how even though Douglass was in the North, he still feared for his life. \"As soon as his narrative was published on the first of June, 1845, Douglass realized that it was necessary for him to leave New England for old England, because his revelation of the concrete facts of his experience in slavery had disclosed his identity, and he was at any moment thenceforth in danger of recapture.\" This shows how even after slaves became free their lives were still in jeopardy. Their lives were filled with the constant fear of what would happen if they were caught. Even though slaves faced fierce punishments if captured, there was still a chance they would become free. In many cases, the punishments diminished slaves' dreams of becoming free but some still saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

This deceptive process of marking ballots incorrectly and giving them to illiterate blacks who would have voted in a different manner became common in the early 1880s.

The economy of the South was still dependent on agriculture, however, as most of its land consisted of rural areas that needed to be farmed. Former slaves, now freedmen, were no longer bonded to harsh labor without benefits. Emancipation resulted in contracts between ex-masters and freedmen agreeing upon paid labor. In return for minimal pay and shelter, African Americans would work on land belonging to white landowners. On the land of George  C. Hannah in Charlotte County, Virginia, former slaves shared a similar experience.  On January 1, 1867, Hannah established a written agreement between himself and the freedmen he hired to work on his land. The agreement would last for the entire year until December 31, 1868, when another would be put into effect. After the expiration of each contract, another would be put into effect for the next year.","            According to Julie Saville in <em>The Work of Reconstruction</em>, slaves had many hard won rights, but were still guaranteed only minimal sustenance and shelter that had to be earned through labor. The nine different workers on Hannah's land, some of whom had families and were formerly slaves, were expected to \"bind themselves to work diligently and faithfully, obeying all orders.\" As long as the freedmen complied fully with every rule and regulation, Hannah would pay them in proportion to their work effort and in accordance with the number of family members each had. The payments ranged from a minimum seventy-two dollars per year, awarded to a single man named Cornelius, to one hundred and sixty dollars for a family of four. Money earned was accompanied by some obligations, however. Some workers had family members who lived in the housing provided by the landowners, and they were obligated to give a certain percentage of their earned wages to landowners in return for the provided living arrangements.

Hannah, if any of the freedmen left their employment before the expiration of the year, or should he have had a \"cause to discharge any of them before such time for neglect of duty, violation of orders, or any improper conduct whatever,\" they would be expelled from their work and forced to forfeit one half of their earned wages for the year."],"display_date":"January 1, 1867 - December 1, 1870","search_date":"1868-12-16","locations":[{"id":13732,"lat":37.0115838339,"lng":-78.6616403562,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLOTTE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4060,"title":"An Extraordinary Slave Preacher\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1849 Rev. William White wrote a narrative about African American Preachers. In it he tells the story of a black preacher known as \"Uncle Jack.\" Slave traders kidnapped Jack from Africa when he was seven years out and sold him into slavery in Nottoway, Virginia. When he was forty he heard a Presbyterian Minister from Prince Edward County preach and became religious. White wrote  that once Jack found religion he wanted to learn to read so that he could study the bible. He convinced his master's children to teach him by \"promising to reward them for their pains with nuts and other fruits, as tuition fees.\" Once he learned to read, he received his license from the Baptist church and began to preach. In Nottoway at this time there were not many churches and Jack was \"often called to preach at a distance of more than thirty miles from his home.\" Additionally Jack \" secured the respect and confidence of the white people,\" as well as the adulation of blacks, and when his master died he was able to buy his freedom thanks to donations from white members of the community. ","Uncle Jack's experience as a black preacher was not typical. Many white southerners were hostile to black preachers after 1831 because of the slave rebellion lead by Nat Turner, a slave preacher, which was responsible for the death of 57 white men, women and children.  Slave owners passed laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read or write, and encouraged slaves to attend services given by white preachers who indoctrinated them with the idea that good, hardworking slaves who respected their masters would go to heaven. ","There are several reasons why Uncle Jack might have been exempt from these restrictions. The first is that he did not fit white stereotypes about slaves, especially in terms of his speech. White wrote, \"the reader must not be surprised, therefore, that nothing occurs in what we quote from his own lips, of the jargon peculiar to the African race. Nobody ever heard the good old preacher say massa for master or me for I.\" Another reason he may have been exempt from restrictions was that he rejected typical \"slave\" style preaching.

The possibility of an insurrection of the newly autonomous group of freedmen in their area terrified the white men of Matthews County. According to the 1860 and 1870 census, freedmen composed almost one half of the population in Matthews, and if united, they could pose a threat to white landowners. The <em>Norfolk Virginian</em> claimed that \"Negroes [were] ... buying arms wherever they [could] procure them\" and \"uttering serious threats.\" This spirit of revenge was thought to exist in freedmen throughout Virginia and the entire South. Conflicts between the freedmen and whites stemmed from the fact that freedmen did not want to be employed by whites under year-long contracts or other conditions similar to slavery.","White fears of \"Negro domination\" manifested themselves in various ways, such as the formation of a militia in Matthews County, Virginia.

Eric Foner discusses the conflicts of implementing a free labor system in the South in his <em>Short History of Reconstruction. </em>Fears of a takeover by blacks existed long before they became freedmen. During slavery, plantation owners lived in constant fear of the possibility of a slave revolt. The Thirteenth Amendment freed the slaves and opened the door to a world of free labor in the southern states. With increasing autonomy in their labor decisions it was plausible that freedmen may seek some sort of revenge on their previous masters. In general, however, most slaves did not desire to seek violent restitution for their time in slavery. Although some freedmen demanded land rights from their masters as payment for their labor during slavery, most focused on reuniting their families, educating themselves, and establishing a black community.  Blacks disliked the year long contracts because they did not allow them to choose the crops they planted and they did not repay them fairly for their labor.

Georgia was formed as a free colony between South Carolina and Florida and used as buffer colony to protect the Carolina planters' slave interests.  However, in 1750, a Creek Indian Chief named Seacoffee left the tribe with a large group of followers.  They traveled from Alabama to Florida, and under the Spanish colonial policy, they were incorporated into the Spanish population and entitled to land in the territory of Florida.  They settled near the area of the Exiles and refused all Creek laws.  These exiles were called \"Seminoles\" by the Creek Indians, meaning \"runaways.\"  They elected their own chiefs and became their own tribe.  Some members intermarried with members from the Maroons, as the groups merged into one entity.

It also shows the development in rhetoric in the South and how discourse concerning women's suffrage evolved throughout the nineteenth century to discuss the movement more objectively. The more objective tone, which indicates change in dealing with women's suffrage and journalistic style, allowed a vehicle for women to be able to express their ideas without excessive critique from the journals that served as public sources of information. This objectivity began with the discussion of women's suffrage in order to keep a white majority in the voting arena. While the Atlanta Constitution did not completely accept women's suffrage, the discussion of it as a solution to curb the African American vote is at least an effort to entertain its possibilities. In 1890, the Constitution ran an article which discussed the debate in Mississippi over women's suffrage as a solution to secure a white majority. Mississippi politicians, according to the Constitution, were in agreement property and education requirements would ensure that less African American would vote and that the women who then were allowed to vote would be educated and would then eliminate the votes of the African American. The concern that Mississippi had though, was that women would not be interested enough in voting rights to actually use them. The Constitution sympathized with Mississippi's problem, but did not support the idea of women receiving the vote. Still, this article shows that people in the South were willing to entertain the idea of women's suffrage. ","            This was not exclusive to Mississippi as many states began to consider women's suffrage so as to keep a white majority of voters. When Southern women took up the suffrage cause, many argued for suffrage in order to keep the white majority within suffrage. These women also wanted to establish suffrage through state amendments rather than national amendments and thus they made suffrage seem more acceptable in the South since they advocated it within the established social structure. Because of this and because of the debates that suffrage as a solution to African American suffrage began, more people started considering women's suffrage as a possibility and women were able to use this as a vehicle to further the cause.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4170,"title":" Seventh day festivities\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-03","end_date":"1859-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 3 1859, Francis Kemble noted in her diary the death of one of her neighbors and subsequent partition of his estate.

The issue of this debate was participation in the Democratic Party National Convention at Baltimore, Maryland-where the party's Presidential nominee was to be decided.  The Baltimore Convention was the second such attempt; Democrats had met earlier from April 30th to May 3rd in Charleston, South Carolina for the same purpose.  There, the majority of the Lower South delegation (as well as a few from the Upper South) felt that the convention had grown hostile to their interests and had failed in its duty to protect the Constitutional right to slavery.  They cited as evidence the primacy of Stephen A. Douglas supporters at the convention and the establishment of a platform that ambiguously endorsed his idea of popular sovereignty for determining territorial slavery.   The disaffected delegates withdrew from the convention and set up their own caucus nearby.  From there, most \"bolters\" expected that they could negotiate their interests with greater leverage and, ultimately, rejoin the National Party.  However, the decision of the National Party Convention to adjourn from Charleston and reconvene on June 18th in Baltimore forced confrontation.  The decision made clear that the National Convention would not just submit to Southern demands.  Yet probably the move's most powerful, and inadvertent, impact was that it removed the breakaway delegation's ability to quietly conduct talks while maintaining overt separation.  Suddenly, Democrats from both the Upper and Lower South were under tremendous pressure to take a stand in what many deemed a choice between polar alternatives of submission or a genuine party split.","            It was in this context that the debate began between <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>and <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>, both Democratic newspapers that usually agreed with each other.  The issue of location proved to be particularly important in their debate, as one may infer from the fact that their cities' hosted two of the three conventions in question.  The <em>Enquirer's</em> native state of Virginia was largely the head of the Upper South states who, at the time, were still members of the National Convention.  Furthermore, though the <em>Enquirer</em> itself was not usually so ambivalent, Virginia had a history of behavior that was at times unfaithful to the Deep South platform, especially in regards to slavery.  <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>, for its part, was a first-rate example of the South Carolinian persona-a zealous and unrepentant champion of slavery and the South; it was not afraid to say \"secession.\"","            The debate began in a May 10th article from the Charleston Mercury challenging <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>.  The <em>Mercury</em> wrote that the <em>Enquirer </em>should have rebuked their delegates for not withdrawing, and further criticized the <em>Enquirer's </em>proposal that the Richmond Convention should wait to act until after the Baltimore Convention.  The <em>Mercury</em> ridiculed this idea that would leave delegates with nothing to do but \"suck their fingers.\" On May 18th, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>had much to say in response.  First, it said that Virginia wanted to participate in the Richmond Convention, but that as it was, they and other likeminded states wouldn't be able to nominate delegates in time.  Next, the <em>Enquirer</em> said that the Southern delegates should participate in the Baltimore Convention.  It said that the temporary fracture of the party was likely enough to restore a majority that was supportive of Southern interests. At last, the <em>Enquirer</em> argued that the obdurate pursuance of the Richmond Convention's current course was not only dangerous to the Union, but also to the unity of border slave states with the Deep South.","            <em>The Charleston Mercury</em> rejoined with what would be the final words on the matter.  Immediately, the <em>Mercury</em> challenged the idea that other Southern states wouldn't have time to join.  Also, to the suggestion that the National Party would change its position, <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>replied that, \"the <em>Enquirer </em>may dismiss from its patriotic anxieties all such romantic anticipations.\"  Finally, the <em>Mercury</em> laid great emphasis on the discussion of Southern unity.

Despite initial reservations about secession, he joined the multitudes of southerners who rushed to enlist.  At first an artilleryman, by 1864 Trueheart had finished studying medicine and was an assistant surgeon in the 8th Alabama Infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was in this capacity that he experienced the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864 in Petersburg, Virginia.","            As Charles W. Trueheart recalled in an August 28, 1864 letter to his brother, Henry Trueheart, the level of death and destruction at the Crater was horrific.  He tells his brother, \"I have never any where seen such a slaughter as there was enacted,\" the dead and wounded were spread across several acres and, \"in many places you couldn't walk without stepping on their carcasses lying one two or even three deep.\"  The \"Crater\" was the result of an attempt by Union forces under Ambrose Burnside to smash the Confederacy's heavily fortified position at Petersburg by tunneling under their location and setting off a major explosion.  To this end, the Union effort was a success, but in the ensuing struggle, the Union attack lacked coordination and became log jammed at the Crater.  The Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee quickly capitalized on this error and inflicted a severe defeat on Burnside's forces, notably including the 4th Division of the United States Colored Troops.  For most Confederates at the Crater, this was their first encounter with black soldiers, here represented in major proportions.","            The black soldiers' presence was Charles Trueheart's main focus in recounting the aftermath of the battle.  His first mention was of the \"Negroes\" that lay dead and wounded with the \"Yankees[,] those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  Throughout the letter, Trueheart looked at the relationship of these two entities. He said that the injured blacks \"bore their sufferings much better than the Yankees;\" that they complained less and displayed greater Christian devotion in their sufferings.  Moreover, Trueheart wrote that the main complaints that the blacks had were that the Yankees abused them and that the slaves among them wanted to return to their masters.  Trueheart then described the heroism and ability of the blacks, almost equal to the Confederates' and far surpassing the behavior of the white Yankees.  He noted an instance wherein, \"one black fellow...had a regular duel with the Sergeant Major of our reg't.\"  Trueheart says that they traded several shots, that the black soldier, in fact, landed the first shot, hitting \"the Sgt. in the forehead.  Fortunately his head was as thick as his heart was brave, and the ball glanced upwards.\"  A Confederate at last shot and killed the black soldier.  In another notable encounter, an \"officer in our Brigade, having captured a negro in the trenches, told him to turn and fire upon the retreating Yankees; which he did rapidly.\"","            It is impossible to determine how much of Trueheart's account was true, but certainly there is a pervasive slant.  Indeed, many others reported with sadistic pleasure the widespread massacre of black troops by soldiers encouraged to execute them rather than take any prisoner.  The purpose of Truehearts' revisions seems almost inherent within the letter.  It reflected an interest, at the very least, in a temporary realignment of social inclusiveness that would incorporate blacks (40% of the Southern population) and thus engender support for the war efforts against \"those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  The value of blacks to the war effort was undeniable; loyalty of slaves on the plantations was a major issue, but their presence on the battlefield could be even more potent.  Around 200,000 black soldiers served in the Union, almost 25% of the number of men thought to have fought for the Confederacy-an especially impressive figure considering the comparatively small proportion of blacks in the Union, as well as their exclusion from enlistment until more than two years after the war began.  ","            By the Battle of the Crater in 1864, confidence in the ultimate success of the Confederacy was waning and there was considerable agitation for inclusion of blacks in the war effort.  Significantly, most supporters of a black soldiery also espoused emancipation, which they saw as an unfortunate but necessary accomplice.  By 1865, even top Confederate officials like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee came out in support of the plan. Yet the time had passed for such a move.  With the Confederate States' defeat in spring of 1865, it became a moot point.  The fragile wartime overture of Southern whites was rendered little more than a moment's retreat from racist agendas that defined much of the South's history."],"display_date":"August 28, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-28","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4258,"title":"An Early Condemnation of &#39;Legal&#39; Disenfranchisement\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-02-07","end_date":"1880-02-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February7, 1880 the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article condemning educational tests for voting registration in the South which an editorial in the Charleston <em>News</em> had proposed as a way of suppressing the black vote. The article explains that the reasoning behind the author in the <em>News</em> editorial was that the \"'more intelligent and reasonable citizens must rule'\" no matter whether they are the majority or not and that suppressing the Negro vote was the only way to ensure this. The problem the <em>News</em> editorial author saw was that the current method of violence and intimidation seemed to violate the law and went against the sentiments of many people both in the state of South Carolina and outside it. Moreover, the current method was inconsistent in its effects, whereas an indoctrinated system would be much more systematized and effective. ","The concepts expressed in the News article were a precursor to future action by southern states. In 1890 Mississippi enacted laws such as literacy tests as a method of \"legal\" disenfranchisement, and as the <em>News</em> article predicted these laws worked amazingly well. They were so effective, in fact, that by 1900 all but four southern states had enacted some form of literacy tests and in those states that had them the black vote was all but extinct. The reason these literacy tests worked so well on the black population was that most slaves had never been taught to read or write and only some progress had been made in educating them after Emancipation. ","The successful imposition of these literacy tests was due in part to the fact that there was wide support for them across the country. The author of the New York Times article, in fact, voiced his support for literacy tests as \"a simple and natural method by which a community can protect itself against serious abuse and dangers.\" The problem the author saw was that these laws would not be administered equally or impartially and were simply a tool for suppressing the black vote. Under this premise \"an educational test becomes merely an instrumentality of wrong and fraud\" and so cannot be tolerated because it interferes with the democratic process. ","One must conclude in reading this article that Northern politicians were well aware of Southern intentions to disenfranchise blacks using legal tools long before they were ever able to enact them. The question is why did they let them? Part of the reason lies in the fact that the Democratic Party returned to national dominance in the mid 1880s and undid much of the Reconstruction legislation meant to ensure black rights. But Richard Valelly in his book <em>The Two Reconstructions</em> argues that it was also the fact that the Republican Party lost interest in the black community as a political group. As he states, \"The enormous and rapid growth of the Republican Party in the late 1890s outside the South substituted for lost black voters at the margin.\" So despite the fact that Republicans in the North knew that Southerners sought legal means to disenfranchise blacks they lacked the legal power and political interest to do anything about it."],"display_date":"February 7, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-07","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4260,"title":"Separation of Church and Race\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-07-01","end_date":"1866-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout 1866, the First Baptist Church in Charleston, South Carolina was rapidly losing its membership.  However, on July 1, 1866, something extraordinarily important happened: several black men applied for a blanket \"letter of dismission\" to cover every \"colored member.\"  Prior to this date, the church officers had been unconcerned because the only requests had been from white members, but black men and women liberated by the Civil War were eager to form separate congregations for the first time, and this was the cause of some concern.  ","The First Baptist  Church record indicates that a committee was formed to decide whether or not to allow the division, ultimately recommending letters to those \"whose standing [was] unquestioned.\"  The committee refused to grant a blanket letter because some blacks wanted to retain their First Baptist membership.  While the church seemed hesitant in permitting separation, it was \"glad\" to sustain black membership.  Those who stayed were guaranteed all privileges enjoyed before.  But these probably included stringent limitations as there was no further movement toward racial equality.","Following the Civil War, race relations within the church were thrown into confusion.  Southern white preachers taught in a process called \"theological racism\" that God supported divisions and inequalities between the races.  At first, white Southerners believed that the situation would remain much the same: white leaders with segregated black sections.  But as evidenced by the First  Baptist Church records, many black people wanted complete separation.  Generally once religious segregation began, white Southern churches resisted the reintegration hoped for by Northern brethren, and black Southerners wanted to retain their new independence, even though they understood its limitations.  Blacks and whites found very little common ground and eventually wanted nothing more than complete separation.  Among various Southern Protestant denominations, the Baptist church was one of the most accessible.  Its independent and localized structure easily supported the organization of new black churches.","In 1866, the First Baptist Church of Charleston, S.C. was in transition, simultaneously supporting segregation and peaceful coexistence.

Abraham Lincoln appeared as a tyrant to many Confederates when he revoked the right of <em>habeas corpus</em>. In doing this, many Confederate sympathizers and informants were arrested without their constitutional rights to a trial. This incited fierce patriotism and nationalism within the South, as Confederates sought to define Kate Stone's \"terrible tragedy.\" To commemorate feelings of patriotism, military leaders, such as Robert E. Lee or the Confederate soldier were viewed as people of honor, which reflected Southern virtues of courage, honor and integrity on the home front.

Roughly fifty blacks were murdered outright and scores more were wounded. Burned to the ground were nearly 100 private homes, 12 churches, and 4 schools. The riots shocked the North and resulting Radical Republican outrage led to congressional investigations and a tightening of federal military occupation of the conquered South.","    It would take weeks before the exact details of the Memphis riots were known. The Freedmen's Bureau of Tennessee conducted an investigation and released a report on May 22. The report was a compilation and summary of a number of affidavits obtained from witnesses and participants in the riots. It was determined that the general cause of the riots was racial tension between blacks and poor whites-- particularly between poor whites and blacks who had served in the Union army. More importantly, \"There was an especial hatred among the city police for the Colored Soldiers, who were stationed here for a long time and had recently been discharged.\" The city police were at the core of much of the rioting, often leading the mobs.","    The rioting began during a confrontation between policemen and black veterans. Attempting to arrest a black for disorderly conduct, some blacks reportedly fired their pistols into the air. Perceiving themselves to be under attack, the police fired into th e crowd. The situation rapidly worsened as city officials dispatched the police into the streets and white citizens were asked to assist in a search for weapons. City Recorder John Creighton delivered an inflammatory speech and demanded \"That everyone of the citizens should get arms, organize, and go through the Negro districts.\" The resulting butchery saw policemen directing white mobs into black homes-- indiscriminate murder of women and children, raping, burning, and robbery ensued.

Its commander, General George Stoneman would later testify before Congress and defend his inaction by saying he wanted to defer to the local authorities. However, in the case of the Memphis riots, local authorities were the very root of the problem. Much of the violence was conducted by local officials and police officers. Ultimately, the black community in Memphis had nowhere to look for protection and federal aid was needed to stop the rampaging population.

Reynolds, who frequented Lamberths' at unseasonable hours, told Calvin Lamberth of what Carter said. Lamberth, a white man, grew angry about this decree and stated that he would hunt and kill Carter on sight. ","            In a few initial attempts Lamberth and a few friends were unsuccessful in tracking down Carter or in carrying out their acts. At about 1:30 PM Calvin Carter, who was unprovoked, shot at Whitlock Fields twice as he warned Carter of the men's search. Immediately following this action a group of 18 white men entered John Carter's Grocery. The eight Negroes in the store were unprepared for this 'organized well matured drill' and they huddled in a corner following the advice of a Mr. Malone. This trapped the black men and the white group charged firing into the huddled assemblage of men.","            The attack killed Orange Rhodes, Calvin Carter was supposedly killed, and a few other men were injured some severely and others slightly; in fact the report also accounts for Calvin Carter as slightly injured. Taken into custody, the white men were placed under bonds of 1500 while awaiting their appearance before a criminal court. Michael Walsh concluded that these eighteen White men had been prepared for this action. He claimed, \"There is reason to believe and circumstances & affidavits warrant the belief that such organization is in existence & that is called the Ku Klux Klan...The parties, numbers, & instituting of such clan is not yet definitely known, but sufficient of the clan and its intentions is known...\"","            This event is just one example of many riots during Reconstruction.

Some members of the Klan believed their purpose was to form a 'vigilance committee to patrol black communities and reduce if not eliminate depredations.' The Klan believed blackness was a 'monolithic non-varying entity that needed to be contained, controlled or destroyed.' James L.

Hudson that also became members of this Baptist church at the same time. Two columns in the record separate members by race; white members were on the left and \"colored\" members were on the right. Who was Easter Hudson? Was she a slave or was she free?","The Greenville County Census of 1830 dictates five thousand and sixty-three slaves were accounted for in that year. There were only thirty-two black residents of Greenville who were recorded as free. By 1840, the census records a twenty percent increase in slaves and an estimate of forty-three freed persons in Greenville, S.C. Looking at the South Carolina deeds of sell for 1820 to 1850 there is an indication that the circulation of slaves was very high. Several slaves who had a trade as a blacksmith, painter, mariner, or other essential profession were sold sometimes as often as twice a year. Slave women were also sold at this rate if they were accomplished cooks or seamstresses. Greenville County's slave holders would rotate these professionals based on demand throughout the region. Usually slaves were only mentioned in the sale by their first name. At this revolving rate, slaves coming through Greenville or the vagueness of the actual records of sold slaves makes it difficult to distinguish if Easter Hudson was a slave owned by a member of the Hudson family or a freed black in 1835.

Due to the fact she appears in the \"colored\" column of the record describes her position as a black member, as well as explaining how white members viewed \"colored\" members.  This leads the question; did Easter Hudson participate in the Baptist Church as a slave? Was she forced to attend, because of her owner's wishes or did she attend on her own free will without the confines of her social situation? "," Brushy Creek Baptist Church recognized slaves as members of the church since its establishment in August 1805. The practice of white Southerners bringing their slaves to church was a very common one. The gallery in a church was especially designed to separate the races in a church. Evangelization was extremely important for southerners to rationalize slavery as an institution based on the paternalistic duties of \"civilizing\" the slave. Slave evangelization was promoted by slave owners, because the ministry of Christianity might, \"encouraged slaves to be more obedient and less prone to rebel against circumstances.\" ","Easter's mere existence in the church minutes is an example of the involvement of black members in a religious organization during the early nineteenth century. The status of black church members is redefined by the emancipation of slaves, especially during the Reconstruction period of the South. Religious racism continued throughout the Reconstruction period and well into the Gilded Age as these individuals struggled with participation and clergy rights in white churches.

In the spring of 1887, William M. Heard, an African American, brought suit against the Georgia Railroad Company after he was obligated to move into a segregated \"Jim Crow\" car. This action set into motion a series of court cases that specifically dealt with racial segregation in railroad cars and attempted to fight against the general ideology of Jim Crow.  Interstate Commerce Laws had been passed by congress in an attempt to deter such segregation, but Jim Crow was strong in the South and growing more powerful every year. Heard was one of the many brave men who attempted to fight the growing and terrible trend of racial segregation. ","Purchasing a first-class ticket in Philadelphia, Heard peacefully road the train until it reached the Georgia border at Augusta. The Atlanta Constitution describes how, at this location, Heard was compelled as a black man to vacate his car and ride in another car where \"the accommodation[s] were second class and inferior in every way\" to those in the first class car that the white passengers occupied. This segregated car to which he was banished was what became known as the \"Jim Crow\" car. Heard had been involved in a similar incident over a year before which had resulted in a successful suit against the company. The Constitution relates that he decided to bring additional suit against the Georgia Railroad Company in order to obtain further confirmation of the Interstate Commerce Commissioners' opposition to such practices by the railroad companies. The Georgia Railroad Company quickly objected to the suit based on \"various grounds\" including the \"jurisdiction of the courts,\" said the Constitution. The company quickly responded to Heard's petition by saying that the cars for the \"colored passengers [were] equally as safe, comfortable, and clean...as those provided for the whites.\" The suit was postponed for a significant period and eventually halted at a stalemate. However Heard had done his part in the fight against segregation of railroad cars. ","Heard was not the only sufferer who decided to fight back. Another suit was filed to the Interstate Commerce Commission by a man name William H. Councill. According to the May 31 Constitution, Councill was seeking 25,000 worth of damages for being \"forcibly ejected from a first-class car after having paid for a first class ticket.\" He was subsequently subjected to riding in the \"Jim Crow\" car. The trend had been set, and the Georgia Railroad Company soon found itself mired down with court cases. The ranks against the Georgia Railroad Company and railroad segregation began to swell even more with the key addition of Rev. George C. Rowe of Charleston. The Constitution describes how Rev. Rowe began a nationwide campaign after he and several other colored passengers were forced to ride in the \"Jim Crow\" car after purchasing first-class tickets. The purpose of Rowe's campaign was to rally support, both moral and financial, with which to bring suit against the Georgia Railroad Company and against racial segregation in general. While the efforts of men such as Heard, Councill, and Rowe may have fallen short in achieving racial equality, their fortitude certainly helped establish precedence for the long and difficult fight against inequality."],"display_date":"1887 - 1889","search_date":"1888-07-01","locations":[{"id":2193,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4320,"title":"Nat Turner&#39;s Rebellion \n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-02-12","end_date":"1831-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    Nat Turner was an American slave who lived in Southampton County Virginia, from 1800 to 1831. Nat grew up very religious, and had the ability to read and write. Along with his education, his spirituality gave him a distinct view of the injustices of slavery taking place around him. Turner believed that he could lead a successful revolt, and in February of 1831 he executed his plan. Turner's original plan was to commence the insurrection on July fourth, but his plans abruptly changed due to a lunar eclipse on the 12th of February. \"On the appearance of the sign, I should arise and prepare myself, and slay my enemies with their own weapons.\"  The eclipse was viewed by Turner to be a sign from god telling him to start the rebellion. Nat Turner, accompanied by a few trusted fellow slaves entered their master's house killing the entire family. Their acts were brutal and merciless.  Recollecting the murders, Nat said, \"Will immediately killed Mrs. Turner, with one blow of his axe. I took Mrs. Newsome by the hand, and with the sword I had when I was apprehended, I struck her several blows over the head, but not being able to kill her, as the sword was dull, Will turned around, and discovering it, dispatched her also.\" Turner's rebel force, which amounted to about fifty strong, continued going house to house until White militia ended the insurrection. On the fifth of November Nat underwent a trial.  He was sentenced to death and later hung. Thomas Ruffin Grey was Turner's lawyer, and he published \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\" as a result of his time spent with Turner when he was in jail. ","    In the antebellum South slave rebellions and conspiracies tended to be extinguished, slaves still continued to resist. Nat Turner's rebellion along with many others raised a continuous concern of safety to the whites living in Virginia. Demographically, the slave population in Virginia was continuously growing, with large concentrations of slaves all over the state. Many whites feared that soon African-Americans would outnumber White slaveholders, making it difficult to keep surveillance over such a large population that could easily communicate. Economically, the plantation economy was deteriorating giving rise to more towns and cities. With the growth of towns and cities, economic gain was found in skilled artisanship, leading to the education of slaves in order for them to conduct such activity. Abolitionist pressure from the north also influenced the African-American community through propaganda and preaching by people sympathetic to emancipation. These factors brewed together produced a slave who was educated, in touch with other slaves, and fueled by the ideas of emancipation.

Batkin had been sold to a man in Tennessee, and he petitioned that state's court for his freedom.  The Circuit Court of Tennessee found that the original Virginia law under which Batkin had been enslaved was a violation of both the Bill of Rights of Virginia and the clause of the Constitution which prohibits bills of attainder, finding someone guilty without benefit of a trial.  Lundy concluded his article with a plea to his readers, urging them to action: \"How many poor wretches may yet be pining in slavery, who were as illegally doomed to that condition as was the ultimately more fortunate Batkin\" ","Lundy believed in limiting the expansion of slavery, but he also sought to establish a colony for freed slaves outside of the United States; he traveled to Mexico, Haiti and Canada looking for suitable sites. While his article was sympathetic to the plight of Batkin, his colinizationist views seem at odds with this abolitionist writing.  Lundy was an agent of the American Colonization Society and used his newspaper to promote its positions. He inspired other abolitionists, including William Lloyd Garrison who, prior to beginning his own newspaper, The Liberator, edited The Genius of Universal Emancipation while Lundy was abroad.  Garrison credited Lundy as \"awakening\" him to the abolitionist cause.  ","In addition to cases like that of Batkin, in which free men were sold into slavery, others were convicted into public service.  Slaves convicted of crimes were also conscripted into this public work as well.

According to historian Warren Sollors, in 1727 a white woman abandoned her husband because she fell in love with a black man. As a result, laws in 1741 called attention to the interracial marriage of whites and blacks in America. A fine of fifty pounds was to be paid in addition to children of these marriages to work on plantations for an additional two years term. This provoked the notion of legally integrating two races into one another's world. Abolitionists published literature and essays in support of cultural mixing between blacks and whites, creating a unified community. H. Dexter's <em>Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, applied to the American White Man and Negro,</em> is documentation of the positive theories and cultural improvements that interlacing the two races would fabricate in America. ","Dexter stated what he felt would make America a perfected race when he claimed, \"All that is needed to make us the finest race on Earth is to engraft upon our stock the Negro element which providence has placed by our side on this continent.\" The concept of creating a powerful combination of both black and white Americans resulted from two abolitionists and psychologists, Dr. Pritchard and Don Felix DeAzara, wrote essays in response to the \"evil of the pure and the benefit of the mixed.\" These scholars relying on scientific racism wrote about color of the skin depending on the temperature and climate conditions in which they were raised. They concluded that color of skin was irrelevant to the content of their hearts. As an example, the pale English would remain white in the rainy climate of England, while the Africans dark with the climate of the hot, humid sun would need their shadowed complexion. The color of one's skin is only<em> </em>a result of one's environment, nothing more. If integration were introduced, soon humans would have red, blond, and brown hair with some straight or curly. Secondly, the vital thing to remember, despite diversity in appearance, the anatomy is all the same. The human race stems from the same Adam.","Despite Sollors's opinion of the advantages of interracial societies being too difficult to pinpoint due to deep-seated prejudices, Prichard managed to do so very boldly and effectively. He declared that states intermixing races creates a very strong, vital series of new cultural advantages both physically and in the workforce. Black intermixing into American society was the starting line in black history, which led them into the \"white limited\" business world. Due to Prichard's positive concepts of black integration, Minchin's novel of the black textile worker discussed the initial occurrences of whites and black intermingling on the job. In addition, Prichard's companion, Don Felix DeAzara, added to the notion of interracial advantages in America. He claimed America's citizens would posses beautiful features and an agreeable personality, which would carry with them in the work force and throughout life. The idea of merging two cultures would give each race particular characteristics of one another. Combining cultures would produce a race of vigorous life on top of stellar physical conditions surpassing previous generations of American society.  ","            Americans learned from watching the Dutch and French interlock with one another, as did they with ancient tales of the Egyptians, that integration of culture could create a powerful result. Taking two commanding races and combining them creates new advantageous in the work force, and in personal development. Such interrelations inscribe new traits and encourage one to \"love our opposites.\" A concerned southerner one asked of integration, \"What will you do with the negro when he is free?\" A proud response foreshadowing the promise of a great nation and the results of integration responded, \"We will take him into our societies, into our churches, into our schools, into our social circles, into our families; we will receive him as our younger brother.\""],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4356,"title":"Andrew Johnsons Veto and the Freedmans Bureau Bill Conflict\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-02-20","end_date":"1866-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Just as the issue of secession and the firing on Fort Sumter triggered the War Between the States, the issue of readmission (and arguably) the assassination of President Lincoln triggered an almost equally bitter conflict. This conflict, however, arose between the Executive and Legislative branches. It is quite possible that only a man of Lincoln's strength could have succeeded in handling the Reconstruction crisis that led to the feud, and Johnson, his successor, was unfortunately not of the same cut. As will be seen, given the nature of the crisis, few people would. ","Generally speaking, Reconstruction is divided into several phases, with the distinction between two of them being Presidential and Congressional Reconstruction, both of which are self-explanatory regarding who was in charge. When Lincoln, the helmsman of the former phase, was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, took it upon himself to follow through with Lincoln's plan for an amicable and (especially) rapid restoration of the Union. Unfortunately for Johnson, the so-called \"Radical Republicans\" that controlled Congress at the time abhorred the Southern States' passage of Black Codes and attempted to slow their reentry into the Union as punishment. Johnson, of course, still had speed as his priority and refused to back these punitive measures. When Congress realized they would get no help from Johnson, they decided to take matters into their own hands and proposed the Freedman's Bureau Bill in late 1865. The Bureau itself had been a temporary entity founded by Lincoln immediately after the war with the intention of assisting the newly freed slaves. Under the Bill proposed by Congress, however, the Bureau's longevity and powers would be greatly increased. While this was ostensibly to give more and better aid to the slaves, it was by no means coincidental that the Bill's passage would transfer <em>de facto</em> control of Reconstruction from Johnson to Congress.  ","From Johnson's point of view, this was a dilemma in the fullest sense of the word: oppose the bill and gain enemies or allow it and lose power. He chose the former and vetoed the passage of the Bill in February of 1866. According to <u>The New York Times</u>, Johnson gave several reasons for this, although the largest one seemed to be that passage of the Bill did not put enough faith in the abilities of the Southern leaders to handle Reconstruction on their own. Furthermore, the article states that Johnson claimed to believe \"that the question of the Union is paramount to all others.\" Taken together, these statements reflect an attempt by Johnson to rally the nation behind him more than anything else. Specifically, in the latter statement he seems to be likening himself to Lincoln and trying to take advantage of the late Lincoln's popularity in the North, with the former statement obviously being an attempt to put him on the good side of the Southern leaders. In the end, this would not help him, as Congress passed the Bill over his veto and basically used their new powers to make life miserable for Johnson, who would go on to have the dubious honor of being the first US President to be impeached.  ","In Johnson's defense, it cannot be denied that Lincoln, a popular man-of-the-people even before he was martyred, would have been a tough act to follow.  In that regard, it is not surprising that Johnson would remain so adamant on his quest to follow through with Lincoln's plan, as to change said plan would have seemed disrespectful to Lincoln's memory and therefore political suicide. The true irony of the situation becomes apparent here, as it was not changing the plan that would turn out to be the real suicide. Specifically, Johnson's unwillingness to deviate from Lincoln's hope for a fast rebuilding-even in the face of the Black Codes-led to Congress trying to seize Reconstruction authority via the Freedman's Bureau Bill, which in turn led to the lose-lose position that Johnson occupied in February 1866."],"display_date":"February 20, 1866","search_date":"1866-02-20","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4357,"title":"Passage of Shermans Special Orders No. 15\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-16","end_date":"1865-01-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although many regard war as good for absolutely nothing, the truth of the matter is that troops are not the only things that advance in war. In fact, some of the greatest advancements made by mankind in fields ranging from medicine to the arts can trace their roots to military necessity. One such example made in the field of Civil Rights during the American Civil War was Special Field Orders Number 15, popularly referred to as \"Forty Acres and a Mule.\" Issued by General William T. Sherman shortly after the end of his infamous March to the Sea, the act placed captured Southern land in the hands of the freed slaves, something that had never been done before. ","The fall of the seaport city of Savannah, Georgia in late 1844 to Union General William T. Sherman brought an end to the general's famous \"March to the Sea.\" Over a period of two months, a fifty-mile wide front of Union soldiers had marched up to 12 miles a day, looting what they wanted and destroying everything else, including the metaphorical chains of untold numbers of slaves. Under the Emancipation Proclamation, all slaves in areas controlled by the Union were granted freedom, which would pose an unforeseen problem in this case. Specifically, Abraham Lincoln had drafted the Proclamation at the North's nadir, when obtaining half as much land and slaves in twice the amount of time as Sherman had just done would have seemed impossible. As such, the Proclamation's wording about what to do with freed slaves was much too vague. Thus, having no way to support themselves, many of the new freedmen attached themselves to Sherman's army.","On January 16th, 1865, Sherman, with the blessing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, attempted to solve this problem with the passage of Special Field Orders No. 15. With the powers granted to him by the War, Sherman confiscated over thirty miles worth of plantations and islands from slaveholders and, taking a page from the 1862 Homestead Act, turned them over to the slaves for use as free settlements. It is interesting to note that while Order 15 is very explicit on such major rules and regulations as the maximum amount of land a single family could own (40 acres), it is remarkably silent on things that deal more with the day-to-day events of the settlement. To be sure, this would be in keeping with the Order's restriction of government interference with the settlement to protection and aid in setting up said settlement.","  Despite this, the Order itself unmistakably struck more of a blow against the CSA military and strategy than for Civil Rights. For starters, although the Order explicitly prohibited conscripting troops from the new settlements, it was no less explicit when it stated that all \"young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist.\" Additionally, the Order effectively turned a great mass of dead weight on Sherman's army into something of an occupation force. In this case, one that would produce rather than just occupy or be refugees and free up veteran soldiers for the coming months of war. On a final note, it is interesting to point out that Section III of the Order contains a line that could be interpreted as preparing for Reconstruction. Specifically, the Order states that Congress has the power to \"regulate\" the titles of the freedmen, effectively laying the ground for a transfer of power when the martial law that created the settlements was rendered null. The legal ramifications of transferring power from military to civilian hands are more complex than many realize, and in giving Congress some authority, Sherman no doubt eased this transfer. Unfortunately, the old maxim that laws are silent in times of war is a door that works both ways, in that the noticed laws of war may be silent in times of peace. In this case, during Reconstruction, much of Sherman's Land Grant properties reverted back to their Antebellum title holders.

Colonization, as the name implies, had the goal of colonizing slaves in Africa in a country called Liberia. As such, there were numerous attempts to convince Africans to willingly emigrate. One pamphlet seeking to do this was entitled \"Address to Free People of Color of the State of Maryland,\" as printed by John D. Toy in 1859. Toy opened by providing a brief summary of his life, saying that he had spent many years traveling, often in the company of Africans, who had shown him much kindness. Following this, he informed his audience of all the political and social rights that they will never gain if they stay in the United States, and tells them they have two options: continue on like this pointlessly, or flee the country. ","After that had been established, the pamphlet starts to sound like the sales pitch it is with the declaration \"Go to Liberia,\" for only there would the black race be free. To be sure, this passage is one of the few unexaggerated claims in the entire pamphlet. The assumption by Toy that race prejudice would hamper the lives of free blacks in the future was well-founded One can see evidence of the kind of racial pseudo-science that had given the European powers the pretext to colonize Liberia in the first place.  Toy reminds his readers that there are three basic kinds of climates in the world, with the black race being best suited for the tropics, in which Liberia is located. Elaborating on this, he describes Liberia as a land of perpetual perfect summer days. Specifically, he says that even though it seldom rains, there is an abundance of green vegetation under a sun that is \"not too hot.\" ","As would be expected of any sales pitch, this pamphlet exaggerates. All in all, Toy makes Liberia sound like Eden itself, down to an abundance of trees with valuable lumber. As for water, there are apparently so many good rivers that \"no one ever suffers even inconvenience from want of good water in Liberia.\" Regarding crops, Toy says that lima beans grow so well in Liberia that little work yields a good harvest and there is so much palm oil that in a few years Liberia will make more money off palm oil than Maryland makes off tobacco. Even today Liberia is \"richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture.\"","As for government, the author states that the government of Liberia has been recognized by many of the Great Powers, with whom they share good trading relations. He also says (as our Founders would put it) that the Liberian government is run by Africans, for Africans. Later on, he states that this will forever be the case because of \"African Fever,\" a malady deadly to whites that blacks are naturally immune to (again showing use of racial pseudo-sciences). Prior to this, however, he tells his readers that the government of Maryland will gladly pay for their passage across the Atlantic. Here we can see just how desperate even the Northern public was to get rid of the Africans. After all, few governments of any era are willing to pay for anything (especially anything expensive) when there is little profit expected in return. Of course, this claim may be another one of the actual truths in this pamphlet. As modern sources report, colonization was \"a costly affair, and the [American Colonization] Society's founders strongly believed that any colony...would have greater viability if it [was paid for] by the United States Government.\"  ","Toy ended his pamphlet by anticipating and answering any negative stories his audience may have heard about Liberia. That answer: in a word, homesickness. He then goes on to add that within a few years people that are homesick will wonder why they ever stayed in Maryland. Finally, the author closes by praising Liberia's infrastructure, asserting that it has fine schools, mechanics, doctors, etc.  "],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":5931,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4392,"title":"Senator Morton of Indianapolis Speaks Out about Colfax Riot\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-09-23","end_date":"1874-09-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Senator Oliver P.

Morton's statement illustrates that there are violent crimes happening in southern states, which led to killings and massacres.  ","Morton moved on to talk about Kellogg's Government that was 'overthrown'. This government, although recognized by the President, Congress and Senate, was not recognized by the Democrats of the South and they felt that they needed to resort to violence and bloodshed to get what they want. He talked of how the government became recognized as the State Government of Louisiana only after they passed a bill to set another election.  He also visited the fact that this government was trying to get the right people into office with people resigning and people filling these positions.

He preached about how there must be a stop to the murders and unnecessary acts of violence for security in Louisiana.

A drawing of the \"new\" convent shows an elaborate building with elements of classical architecture consisting of a three story convent, orphanage and chapel. Designed by architectural firm Gurlie and Guillot, the convent was decorated with galleries, columns, and Baroque ornamentation. Facing the Mississippi river, it rivaled many of the surrounding plantation homes in both size and construction. ","Before the Ursuline nuns relocated to this new convent from their previous location in the middle of the French Quarter, they had been an important presence in the city of New Orleans for almost a century. They arrived from France in 1727 to establish a school for girls in what was then a French colony. They provided an education not only for white girls of the colony, but also for slaves, free girls of color, and Native American girls. In addition, the Ursulines ran an orphanage and a hospital. In the years immediately following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Ursuline nuns experienced several conflicts with both federal and city officials. One such conflict with the United States government concerning property ownership within the city, led the nuns to purchase property two miles outside New Orleans with the idea of moving. In 1819, the nuns experienced a different conflict: as New Orleans expanded, a closed off street going right through the convent compound had become an inconvenience to the public. In response, city officials decided to open this street to the public, despite protests from the Ursulines. This decision was what drove the nuns to sell some of their city property and to construct a new convent outside the city. The new location gave the nuns the ability to expand as well as the advantage of both being outside the jurisdiction of city officials and of being out of the way of city development.","The convent cost 83,172 to build, and the chapel was an additional 23,635, a total equivalent to about 2 million today. Emily Clark argues that by spending this much money to build an extravagant convent, the Ursuline nuns were making a statement as self-governing Catholic women in a Protestant country that valued a woman's submission to the authority of a husband.

This ironic dichotomy was very evident amongst the upper class men of New Orleans, and it heavily influenced the future landscape of the city.  With a 'not in my backyard' view of prostitution, the wealthy males of New Orleans, although many were clients of prostitutes, did not want their homes and families near the lewd activities of the prostitution business.","The <em>Mascot</em>, a Louisiana newspaper, highlighted the effects of prostitution on the community, echoing the opinions of some New Orleanians.  The July 11, 1892 edition of the paper portrays the population's general fear of bordellos, depicting a family outside of their home, parents shielding the eyes of their children from the sight of the bordello next door.  With prostitution so prevalent, many did not want their families exposed to it.  Also, the wealthy citizens viewed nearby prostitution as a detriment not only to their families, but also their financial assets.  With prostitution in the neighborhood, residential property values dropped, causing a real concern for New Orleans' wealthy.","So, rather than trying to eliminate prostitution, the wealthy male political leaders instead accepted that, according to Louisiana historian Alecia Long, \"sins of the flesh were inevitable\" and \"gave [Satan] his own address.\"  The municipal government's first attempt to reduce areas of prostitution was with the Lorette Ordinances of 1857.  But, by 1897, many citizens, interested in preserving both the moral and property values of their neighborhoods, advocated for the gathering of the city's prostitutes into a more specific, much smaller district: Storyville.  The Story Ordinances turned a predominantly poor, African American part of town, away from the upper class neighborhoods, into the new home of sex.","The location of the official district of prostitution in 1897 truly revealed the magnitude of racial superiority and economic self-interest in New Orleans.  The impoverished African Americans of Storyville were a powerless group in the social hierarchy of power in New   Orleans.  Protesting the vice district's zoning was simply not an option as blacks in the city had no voice in politics.  But, local leaders often defended the Story Ordinances, citing that only one church and one school were within the new, smaller district, even though the church and school were predominantly black.  This action from the political leaders, Long implies, perpetuated a message that African Americans shared the same social status as prostitutes, \"both conceptually and in terms of physical proximity.\" Seeing blacks as immoral sexual beings was not an uncommon view in 19th century culture."],"display_date":"July 11, 1892 - December 31, 1897","search_date":"1895-04-06","locations":[{"id":5602,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4623,"title":"Crittenden Attempts to Stave off Secession","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-18","end_date":"1860-12-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":null,"display_date":"December 18, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-18","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4449,"title":"Liberation of Slaves and Colonization in Liberia in 1825\n","course_id":17,"status":"P","start_date":"1825-09-03","end_date":"1825-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    In 1825, Christian groups and colonization societies in America advocated for freed African Americans to colonize land in Liberia as an alternative to emancipate slaves in America. Religious groups expressed their sentiments in publication including the Christian Register, which published an article in an issued dated September 3, 1825. The article argued for the transportation of slaves to their homeland in Liberia because it would be beneficial to the discriminated African American race for a plethora of reasons. The publication argued slaves would regain freedoms denied to them in America as well as allow them to establish their own government the way they desired. Freed slaves would be allowed to cultivate the land of Liberia by utilizing certain technology the United States would introduce to the country. Colonization societies believed light American presence would allow former slaves to excel in the agricultural, economic and political realms of their society because freed slaves in Liberia would have ties with one of the most technologically advanced nations of the era. The Christian Register boldly emphasized the emancipation of enslaved peoples as morally correct, and a resolution was desperately needed to appease slaveholders and abolitionists alike. Sending slaves to Liberia seemed to offer the best mode of compromise.","    The issue of whether the emancipation of enslaved African Americans was necessary during the nineteenth century played a crucial role in the development of beliefs in certain groups, such as the American Colonization Society and the Pennsylvania Colonization Society. The American Colonization Society, the Pennsylvania Colonization Society, and the Christian Register advocated that the sending of freed slaves would be beneficial to enslaved African Americans. However, after reanalyzing the efforts of pro-colonization societies and publication, historians of the 21st century have come to understand that colonization was in response to the threat of freed African Americans if emancipation legislation was passed in the United States. Abolitionists offered information, which discredited the efforts of colonization societies by arguing reports from Liberia were deplorable. Slaves were rarely sent to their homeland and conditions in Liberia were treacherous. There was no possible way freed slaves could colonize Liberia the way pro-colonization supports had argued they could in the nineteenth century. Abolitionists were capable of discrediting the ideologies of colonization societies because it was based on the belief of negrophobia. In fear of how African Americans would respond if they were finally emancipated from slavery, colonization societies believed by sending them to Liberia, they would not have to deal with the potential hazardous outcomes of emancipation."],"display_date":"September 3, 1825","search_date":"1825-09-03","locations":[{"id":11226,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4459,"title":" Publishing War over a Negro Encyclopedia Rages on in Correspondence \n","course_id":19,"status":"P","start_date":"4/27/31","end_date":"12/23/36","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a 1936 letter to Dr. James H. Dillard, the Charlottesville philanthropist affiliated with the efforts to fund and improve black education in America, Dr. Carter G. Woodson wrote of a recent loss of staff on the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History due to the efforts of Anson Phelps Stokes, Thomas Jesse Jones and others.  Considered by Woodson as the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia,\" Stokes and Jones, among others played the role of conspirators against the Association's production of the \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in Woodson's depiction.  Dr. Woodson claimed that these men, \"devoted to Negro control,\" were responsible for stealing his former employee and recruiting him to destroy the efforts of the Association.  Woodson wrote, \"they hope to divide the Negroes in their attitude toward what we are doing.\"  With this letter, he hoped to gauge Dillard's stance on the issue and push him to choose a group to support.","            The first battle in this outright publishing war actually occurred a few years earlier, when the April 27, 1931 Phelps Stokes Fund meeting spawned the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro\" project.  The announcement of this Stokes-Jones supported encyclopedia hit Woodson hard, who had been working on his own encyclopedia of the same subject matter for a decade by that time.  It also spurred Woodson to engage in public battles with these two men and their associates in interviews and through correspondence, like the letter he sent to Dr. Dillard.  After having already announced the work of the Association to compile and publish an \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in 1921, Woodson believed that Stokes and Jones aimed to publish a story of the Negro \"as the white man wants and is willing to pay for.\"  For Woodson, the duplication of a work that his organization had already compiled extensive data for proved that the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia\" acted as enemies of blacks in America and not friends.  He addressed this idea in earlier correspondence with the council overseeing the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro.\"  In a 1932 letter, he asked the promoters of the encyclopedia either to furnish his association with a small sum of money to finish their own work or to use their funds to fix other problems facing the black American.  Woodson also suggested the appointment of an officer from the Stokes-Jones council to review the efforts of both sides and assess the inventory and progress of each project.  The Stokes-Jones camp declined to adapt either suggestion to the activities of their fund and the battle waged on throughout the years.","            Carter G. Woodson believed that the education of blacks needed changes to reverse the effects of a black inferiority complex.  Woodson wanted an organic education for blacks that came out of their history and experiences, and not from outside influences.  This desire for truth and authority in retelling the story of the black American to the world guided Woodson's scholarly endeavors.  This same desire pushed him to question the motives of Stokes and Jones, as well as their associates.  Believing education steeped in the black experience and the \"true\" history of the race to be crucial to the development of the black American, Woodson could not reconcile the white leadership of the Stokes-Jones project with their supposed aims of providing blacks with a document for their race.  According to Woodson, \"Negroes must be led to solve their own problems and thus carve out their own future,\" and if the promoters of the Encyclopedia of the Negro declined to aid this plan, then they proved themselves as negative influences on the movement to improve black education.  Carter G. Woodson wanted to help blacks help themselves by providing them with their own history and achievements to share with the world.  The \"Encyclopedia Africana\" represented an outlet to provide that scientific and historical information for people, and to Woodson, other efforts towards creating a similar work that ignored his aims lacked authority and validity.","Citatio"],"display_date":"April 27, 1931 - December 23, 1936","search_date":"1934-02-23","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":61,"tag":"encyclopedia"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Race and Politics of Reconciliation","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":19,"school_id":1}},{"id":4464,"title":"Edward Everett Extolls Civilizing Liberia\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-18","end_date":"1853-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At the thirty-sixth annual meeting of the American Colonization Society (ACS), the main concern for US Secretary of State Edward Everett was whether it was possible to maintain a civilization in Africa and whether or not the ACS was successful in attempting it.  In his speech, Everett discussed the reasons for the ACS, such as stopping the slave trade, and discusses their inspirations which include the spread of Christianity and American ideals.","Historian Irving H. Bartlett regarded Everett as \"conventional among Americans outside of the South\" in his views on slavery.  He knew that slavery was an \"unfortunate institution,\" but that it was protected by the Constitution.  This made Everett a relatively neutral party in assessing the accomplishments of the ACS.  Everett showed that the ACS had succeeded in its original goal which was to stop the slave trade.  He said that many other civilizations had attempted to stop the trade, but the ACS had actually done it by giving slaves that were on captured slave ships a place to settle and possibly assist them in finding their original homes. ","He later talked about the many reasons civilizing Africa had been a failure and why the ACS would correct this failure with their plans.  Everett believed that the white man could not civilize Africa because disease and cultural and environmental differences in Africa would not allow it. He went on to say that with all of the natural endowments of Africa, it had to be civilized because it was a waste of such a fertile continent. The argument of many of the critics of the ACS was that Africans were too inferior to Europeans to be civilized.  Everett said that this was not entirely true, and cited the example of the Egyptians and of many intelligent Africans who had been given appropriate education. Everett argued that if the lower classes of white men were compared with the African race then the superiority of whites may not be so apparent.  He compared the accomplishments in Liberia by the colony set up by the ACS to that of the first colonies in America such as Jamestown and Plymouth.  In Liberia they had already established a Constitution of organized republican government, courts, schools, communication to the interior, agriculture, and most importantly churches.  These accomplishments outstripped those by the first colonies of America in their first twenty-five years.","One of the main arguments by Everett was that Christianity guided the Africans into civilization and by the African Americans teaching the natives Christianity all will be civilized.  He said that the \"blessings of the Christians\" can be shown to Africa through the newly established colonies.  He thought that the influence of \"pure, unselfish, Christian love\" was the only influence that could never fail and that this alone civilized the world. Everett liked the idea of the spread of the Christian and American ideals to Africa more than the civilization of the Native Africans."],"display_date":"January 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-18","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4480,"title":"Great Migration, Religion, and Churches in New York City","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-01-01","end_date":"12/31/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The \"Great Migration\" of African Americans to the north in the early 1900's was the result of years of enslavement. The migration introduced new eager American citizens to the north during a time when new faces were foreign faces. For African Americans, the lure of freedom from Jim Crow laws, a higher and fairer wage for labor, and a fresh start to life was reasons enough to move to \"the promised land\". New York among other big cities was the destinations of choice for African Americans. The newly emancipated African Americans brought to the north a lifestyle they adapted to in the south. This lifestyle became integrated into communities African Americans inhabited. My primary source is a postcard from the early 1900's of Forest Avenue in New York City depicting a Congregationalist church at a corner street in a supposedly black neighborhood. The postcard not only depicts many traits of the turning century, but also provides small but significant insight into how the church acted as an aid and an outlet for those making not only a transition into a new century but also a social and cultural transition at the same time.","            The settlement in the north proved the church served as an alleviation and refuge from the acclimation to a strange new home and community. The church's role in the north was often similar to the way it was in the south during slavery. As conditions in New York became overcrowded, places of worship were hard to find among the busy streets. However once churches were developed, often being erected from older buildings, the church served as the center of a community. One of my supporting sources is also a primary source that is a newspaper article describing the events of the dedication of a new location for the <em>Forest Avenue Church</em>. Before it took the name <em>First Congregational Church of Morrisania</em> it was known as <em>Forest Avenue Congregational Church </em>and was established in 1851. The dedication described by <em>The New York Times</em> was not a long article, but gave only the basic details of the ceremony. The actual ceremony was long and included many keynote area speakers indicating this was a significant event for the community. The African American population boom brought new ideologies in denomination and Christian perspectives and accounted for more and more African American churches and communities springing up. Once many African Americans migrated north religion and worship continued to be a very key practice. However, the spirit and style of African American worship changed significantly once the migration occurred. More specifically was the Negro spiritual and how song and dance was incorporated in church. The worship services were not as stringent as they were in the South and for good reason because they now had reason to celebrate their deliverance. As this \"second emancipation\" occurred northern cities and people were forced to handle the product of victory in the Civil War. ","            Like many foreign immigrants, African American immigrants had to live in close quarters and earn small wages. They escaped much of the discrimination experienced in the south, yet hardships were not far off. Religion was a backbone of African American life in the south, and it was the same in the north. The church was able to unveil the well-beaten Underground Railroad allowing many more African Americans to travel northward. This was a time of change in American history that ushered in new developments for regional development and identity. Along with providing a link between the north and the south, the African American migration and subsequent expansion of the church provided a visibly direct by-product of the events of slavery and Civil War.

Today it is not that big of a deal that a black man is running for president, or for any office in the government.  However, one hundred and fifty years ago, a black man was not even considered a person, much less someone who could run for political office, especially Secretary of State.  Fredrick Douglass, a former slave, was about to change all that.  Facing much persecution, he ran for the office Secretary of State of New York in 1855.  This idea had been opposed by many.  As it is said in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"the whole thing is supremely ridiculous and can only issue in increasing the feeling in New York against this class of people.\"  Most did not think or believe that a black man should be allowed to hold such a position.","Douglass's race would be a big issue in his run for office.  In the mid 1800's a black person was not considered a whole person, much less a candidate for a government office.  Under the Constitution an African American was only considered three-fifths of a person, and was sold like property.  Also, most African Americans had limited access to education.  As a former slave, Douglass taught himself how to read and write in many different ways.  He educated himself and then escaped to freedom.  After he became free, Douglass became an abolitionist, fighting to end slavery for all blacks.  He would play a huge role as one of the few abolitionists who had actually been through slavery before.  This would help him in his run for office.  It allowed people to know his name, and know what he stood for before he ran.    ","Douglass's run for high office brought him a lot of unwanted attention, though.  The more people who became informed of Douglass's goal, the more people who would try to stop his progress.  It is written in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"if the Negroes cannot vote, they can be voted for and if under a social ban, they can be ennobled.\"  But since blacks could not vote yet, Douglass had to rely on whites to vote him into office, and the chances of a white man voting for a former slave, or any black man, seemed impossible.  Although Douglass did not receive the position of Secretary of State that he longed for, he did write books about his life.  He wrote about his thoughts, his slavery, and his freedom using what education he gathered through the years.

Some southerners even talked about reviving the slave trade in the mid-1850s, but most Americans opposed this idea, and numerous slave smugglers were put on trial in the United States.  According to the <em>New York Herald</em>, \"the United States considered slave trafficking legal but the laws considered it piracy.\"  During the Revolution it was a fact that the American Colonies were involved in the slave trafficking, but at that point all nations considered it legal. By the middle of the nineteenth century, many western nations opposed the slave trade. ","Before 1808, Congress could not prohibit Americans from participating in the slave trade, but they did pass a law, in 1794, that the owners of American vessels caught engaging in any slave trafficking would be fined two thousand dollars and forfeit their vessel. In 1800, Congress changed the fine to one thousand dollars and added two years imprisonment for anybody present on the vessel while participating in slave trafficking.

Woodward entered the Civil War by enlisting as a second lieutenant in company K of the Ohio 2nd Cavalry Regiment, but he left the war as a Colonel of the 116th Regiment of the United States Colored Troops. His tenure with the Ohio 2nd Cavalry yielded rewarding results, as he was promoted to Full Captain on November 14, 1862, just one month and eight days after he enlisted. However, things changed on July 15, 1864, when he was decommissioned from the Ohio 2nd Cavalry, and reenlisted as a Colonel on the same date with the 116th United States Colored Troops. The 116th Regiment was fully organized on July 12, 1864, so Colonel Woodward was with the 116th from its formation.","Colonel Woodward’s troops were involved in the siege of Petersburg from October 23, 1864 to April 2, 1865. Specifically, they were a part of the major charge that took place at 4:00 a.m. on April 2 to drive the Confederate forces from Petersburg, and then followed the retreating Confederates to Appomattox. They were also a part of taking Fort Gregg (on April 2), where they supported an artillery barrage led by the 31st Regiment. Woodward said of the troops’ actions at Fort Gregg, “This regiment, although exposed to the enemy’s fire of solid shot, took their position with the greatest coolness.”","Despite being in this great battle that finally subdued the Army of Northern Virginia, the 116th Regiment never seemed to be in the forefront of the battle, but primarily relieved troops and provided support for battle instead of being part of strategic maneuvers. This was true of most black troops at the time, because popular opinion held that black soldiers would not be able to fight effectively in battle, even after African American soldiers had performed well in previous battles. In spite of this, the black soldiers wanted to prove themselves, and the only way to do so was on the battlefield. Based on Colonel Woodward’s report, the 116th Regiment did prove themselves. Colonel Woodward ends his battle report by praising his officers, regimental commanders, and enlisted soldiers, saying that he would like to commend “the good conduct generally of the enlisted men of the command, during a period of severe marching, and reduction of rations, amounting to almost absolute destitution.”","The 116th U S Colored Troops were exposed to a variety of aspects of the war in a short amount of time, specifically militarily and socially. African-American soldiers in the Civil War faced many different forms of racism and ill treatment. Apart from being paid less, they were often assigned “fatigue duty” or “military labor,” and were put to use doing manual labor like digging trenches. This support work was often the predominant use of African American troops, and many regiments of Colored Troops were often not engaged fighting. The 116th Regiment was put on fatigue duty and experienced injustices, but they were also engaged in a major battle during the siege of Petersburg. The experience of war for the 116th Regiment and Colonel Woodward was not solely based in the military, but also had deep social and cultural experiences that were unique to African Americans."],"display_date":"April 2, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-02","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":303,"tag":"Battle of Petersburg"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4867,"title":"No Blacks in New County Jury Lists","course_id":31,"status":"P","start_date":"7/12/35","end_date":"7/12/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“Negroes have not served on juries in North Carolina since the White Supremacy Campaign in 1898,” noted the <em>Richmond County Journal</em>.  Yet In 1935, commissioners faced a decision of the United States Supreme Court that African Americans could not be systematically excluded from jury lists. African Americans were excluded anyway. The <em>Richmond County Journal</em> stated that the Register of Deeds, Mr.Battley, did not want any African Americans on the jury list, and with no remorse, stated that African Americans would not be considered. African Americans seeking improved treatment looked to the president, the justice department, and whenever the issue could be forced, the Supreme Court.  Although considered free, African Americans were also considered racial outsiders, kept largely outside the political establishment that shaped the criminal justice system, especially when it dealt with civil rights.","African Americans’ exclusion from juries was well documented throughout history.

These charges could, if convicted, have the accused serve from two to twenty years in prison. The four white men indicted were never brought to trial. There were no African Americans participating in any of these trials; therefore, justice was not served. After this incident, the jury selection box was empty. 750 names were needed to fill the empty slots. Although qualified, no African Americans were used to fill the open slots. 217 men testified of never serving on a jury or hearing of an African American who had.

He joined the Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association as a catcher.

A small group of students seized control of the administration building and phone systems on Thursday. The students were all male upperclassmen. Dr. Jones, the college president was the first to discover the students and speak with them. According to Dr. Jones, the students were peaceful, and no damage had been done to any school property. The takeover did interrupt the routine school schedule: the administration building had been taken over on Wednesday night, and on Thursday teachers reported to work to find few if any students in the classroom.","The students circulated a four page list of grievances signed by the “dissatisfied student body.” They urged administrators to solve the problem of apathy and prejudice among faculty and instructors with improved hiring practices and better teachers. The students wanted administration to seek more state funds, as well as add courses in African American History and a basic curriculum in black awareness, including a course in economic problems of black Americans. The list also included longer library hours and lower text book costs, with better service at the bookstore and the post office. Another demand was a full time worker in the infirmary and better cafeteria conditions, including more sanitary practices by employees, better, and pest extermination. Dr. Jones talked with the leaders of the group and was hopeful a solution could be arranged. This is the second protest at Fayetteville State; in 1966 students held a demonstration with grievances similar to these. A similar demonstration was held at Virginia Union in Richmond the same week; the students there had fifty-two grievances. Richard Mclntire, the author of<em> Impacting Change, </em>explains in his article that students were a major part of the success of the civil rights movement. Mclntire explains how a small group of students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College started the Greensboro sit ins at Woolworths lunch counter. The sit ins got the attention of SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King contacted students on several campuses and within weeks students in eleven cities held sit ins. Six months later the students that sat in at Woolworths lunch counter were served. SNCC was founded at Shaw University in North Carolina that was sponsored by the SCLC. Student volunteers were called freedom riders and they took bus trips into the south to test out the newly prohibited segregation laws.","The students at these lack luster universities were surrounded by protests and demonstrations by people demanding social equality, changes in policy, and other improvements. Naturally the students were compelled to conduct a demonstration of their own. The needs of the student body were very basic, and few could doubt that there should be sanitary practices in the café and a full time worker in the infirmary. The students should not have needed to encourage administration to get funding from the government because they should have been doing that anyway. A black school should have courses about black people.

The family is being served dinner by a maid, that also appeared to be in a good mood in the advertisement. This advertisement was an illustration of the menial work black women had to do in the 1930s. Domestic jobs were usually the most common types of work available to black women; depending on the location, domestic jobs were sometimes the only work available to black women. There were very few honorable employment opportunities available to black women, but a few black women were teachers or shop keepers, and some were able to do clerical work. Many times the more respectable jobs were only available to light skinned black women if they were available to black women at all. Regardless of the job description, black women were grossly underpaid for their work.","During the 1930s the American economy was at an all-time low, and the Great Depression was in full effect. The domestic job field became very competitive due to the poor economy; more women were seeking work as domestics, while those people who had maids discontinued their services. All of these factors drove down the already low wages. Domestic workers had to cook and clean after other families as well as their own, and just as portrayed in the advertisement, domestic workers spent their holidays cooking and serving their employers instead of being with their own loved ones.","Historian Jacqueline Jones has described the Great Migration, the time when many blacks moved to northern cities from 1900 to 1930 to find better jobs and opportunities.  According to Jones, the rumors of the north being a better place for blacks were only half true. There was a lot of immigration at the same time blacks were moving to northern cites; this made it hard for African Americans to get factory jobs because although blacks spoke English and were Protestant, the employers preferred to hire immigrants. Many black women were the bread winners of their households or their wages were close to that of their men. The black women moving north had hoped to escape domestic work because the progress of African Americans as a group was tied to the job status of black women. Black women eagerly sought factory jobs that offered more money for less working hours and did not have the social woes that came with domestic work. In the end, most black women were trapped in domestic service, but according to Jones black women measured their success by the standards of those still in the South. Life in the North was hard, but women rarely decided to move back south because in the North their children had better educational opportunities, and black women could also vote and participate in politics."," "],"display_date":"December 20, 1933","search_date":"1933-12-20","locations":[{"id":22391,"lat":35.7900765104,"lng":-78.6503526888,"zoom":9,"place":"Wake, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"African-American History from 1863 to the Present","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":31,"school_id":9}},{"id":4881,"title":"The Folklore and Dance behind Zora Hurston","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/34","end_date":"1/31/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Anyone wishing to get a real glimpse into negro life in Florida should not miss the performance to be given in Recreation Hall.” <sup><sup>1</sup></sup> This praise, given to the anthropologist, writer, poet, dancer and singer Zora Neale Hurston, came from R. W. France about her 1934 production of <em>All De Live Long Day</em>. Zora lived her life in an attempt to revitalize and find the truth behind her African American culture, which at the time was mostly represented elaborately and inaccurately. The majority of her work was presented from research she had done extensively because she wanted to recreate her findings as purely as possible. Through folktales, songs, folk plays, and dances, Zora was able to not only to identify her culture, but also show the world the artistic works of African-American people. A look into her past as an ethnographer as well as her experience with dance can help us understand why and how she wrote this production.","I find it important that there is an understanding that African American culture is influenced continuously and had been influenced since these shores were beached. Ever before Zora's time, hundred of factors have limited, scarred, undermined, and frightened Blacks in the United States. And along with this, their history had not been created by themselves, but by their white superiors of the time. People didn't make much effort to truly observe African American life and culture, and so misconstrued ideas about black folk art forms of the past were represented. But Zora could see through this. Being more than just a writer, dancer, or singer, her anthropological and ethnographic background opened her eyes onto peoples who were similar and heavily influenced the rapidly changing culture of African Americans. “Hurston had spent a relatively short but productive period in contact with the full roster of artists, intellectuals, and patrons of the Harlem Renaissance, drawing on her acquaintance with Southern black folklore for writing stories and for storytelling in social gatherings.” <sup><sup>2</sup></sup>","In reference to her approach in studying and arranging dance, Zora was a careful observer.","With particular concern about the ways in which commercialized depictions of blackness were being misconstrued as representative of African American life, Hurston set out to produce a concert that revealed in embodied form her own nuanced theory of black vernacular expression. At root, this theory sought to re-situate African American cultural products in relation to the material conditions of a Southern rural folk community, as well as to African diasporic roots and routes. <sup><sup>3</sup></sup>","She tried as best she could to immerse herself within the culture. The final act in<em> All De Live Long Day</em> is reenacts many different dances, including the Courtship dance, the Crow dance, and the Fire dance (which she was particularly fond of). These are not just a random assemblage of movements: each one has strong roots in African American culture. Her data and observations took place in looking at Caribbean dance, which is more unchanged from its origins. The Caribbeans and African Americans have long been connected and influential towards one another, beginning with the roots. And Zora didn't just observe, she participated with the people, learning the intricacies and feelings behind the dance.","The African American are a people who have had to deal with rapid change in status and ideologies. Because of this, it can be easy to look at what is considered to be historical and accept it as fact. But, when an elite and prejudiced group is the one setting things in stone, intentionally and unintentionally “facts” can be recorded incorrectly. Zora Neale Hurston is a woman who looked at her people with pride and therefore wanted to open the world to their truth. Though seemingly unimportant, songs, folklore and dance can help distinguish a people from another, showing the beauty in differences. A background in anthropology and writing allowed Nora to both put herself on level with those she was studying and correctly express it in such a way that is accurate and intricate. African American history has had its long and tedious battles, making it more than deserving of realistic representation.","1 Zora Neale Hurston “All De Live Long Day” Rollins College Archives (January, 1934)","2 Benigno Sánchez-Eppler “Telling Anthropology: Zora Neale Hurston and Gilberto Freyre Disciplined in Their Field-Home-Work,” <em>American Literary History</em>, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Autumn, 1992): 464-488","3 Anthea Kraut “Between Primitivism and Diaspora: The Dance Performances of Josephine Baker, Zora Neale Hurston, and Katherine Dunham,” <em>Theatre Journal</em>, Vol. 55, No. 3, Dance (Oct., 2003): 433-450"],"display_date":"January 1934","search_date":"1934-01-16","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":496,"tag":"Dance"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4896,"title":"A look at the evolution of the slave trade through the eyes of a slave trader.","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It is the year 1826, 30 years after the American Revolution boldly stated that all men are created equal, but this first-hand account of Theodore Canot, an Italian adventurer paints a much darker picture of the times. Brantz Mayer’s 1854 work, “Captain Canot; Twenty Years of an African Slaver” vividly describes his friend’s grizzly profession; providing a historical document unmatched in detail and accuracy. Captain Canot becomes notorious in the Americas and West Africa as a ferocious slave trader who acquired slaves through both capture and as plunder from other vessels. He represented a new age of the slave trade, a post-revolution day when slavery and race had becomes so deeply intertwined. This primary document provides insight into the slave trade after the American Revolution, a business rooted in the beliefs of racial inferiority more than the need for labor.","The memoir provides an inside look into the cruel practice of slave trading, which continued on much longer than one might think. Almost a century after Thomas Jefferson inked that timeless phrase in the Declaration of Independence, hypocrisy combined with an expanding demand for slave labor on plantations in the South contributed to the continuation of the Atlantic slave trade. Even after the Emancipation Proclamation, in America, the trading in human beings continued nearby. Cuba and Brazil, for example did not abolish slavery until 1886, and 1888, respectively, and an illegal slave trade was present right up until the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (1). The desire for profit often outweighed any moral dilemmas associated with trafficking men and women. This was certainly true in the case of Captain Canot, a man who had lived many years in Baltimore. The idea that Africans were racially inferior and therefore “sub-human” legitimized the practice in the eyes of many Americans. While the antislavery movement gained steam in some northern areas, the belief that blackness and slavery are one in the same held in the South. Slavery was no longer about labor owed to another person, no longer something one can buy out of, but simply being black meant you were a slave for life.","With this belief system, Canot had no trouble capturing, abusing and selling Africans, even branding them “with pieces of silver wire or small irons fashioned into initials heated just hot enough to blister without burning the skin”(2). The brutal treatment continues as the slaves are boarded onto the ship, “Officer, whip in hand, range the slaves in place, those on the right side of the vessel facing forward and lying in each other’s lap while those on the left are similarly stowed with their faces towards the stern” (2).  While packing these proud people into the ship like sardines, they arranged them in a particular way because this was “considered preferable for the action of the heart” (2). Canot and his crew simply thought of Africans as cargo, something to be delivered and kept alive, rather than human beings.","The idea of Africans being sub-human was not new. It had developed through hundreds of years of slavery. Both Europeans and Africans were involved in the development of this idea, as slavery had existed on the continent long before Europeans had set foot there. Mayer asserts that “slavery and the careers of men like Canot must be the fruit of Africa’s own fatal flaws,” demonstrating his belief that Africans themselves were the main culprits in the continuation of the slave trade. Mayer asserts that Africa is a continent “unstirred by progress… full of the barbarism that blood and tradition have handed down from the beginning” (2). Basically, while European slave traders and American plantation owners participated in treating people like property, the state of Africa itself was the main cause of the spread of slavery.","However they originated, the racist beliefs that Africans are sub-human and therefore property have marked our country’s history. These ideas precipitated racial tensions that have persisted to some degree even in modern America. The story of Theodore Canot is a powerful look into the evolution of racism. It is unique in that it both graphically details the cruelty and brutality of the slave trade, and provides insight into how these men could have possibly justified their horrific actions."],"display_date":"1826 - 1850","search_date":"1838-07-02","locations":[{"id":5928,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"},{"id":1281,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":157,"tag":"Transatlantic Slave Trade"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4954,"title":"A Walk With God","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"12/1/55","end_date":"12/20/56","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 23, 1956, more than two thousand African Americans filled the church from basement to balcony and overflowed into the street for a meeting to urge their followers to boycott the city’s buses.  This meeting was the result of resistance efforts that began when Rose Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery city bus to a white man on Thursday, December 1, 1955.   Months later in the basement of the church the African Americans chanted and sang; they shouted and prayed; they collapsed in the aisles and they sweltered in the eight-five degree heat.  African Americans worked with these blistering conditions for months as they boycotted the Alabama city buses. ","Eighty-nine of the boycott participants, including twenty-four Protestant ministers, were arrested February 23, 1956 and were charged with carrying on an illegal boycott.  But the African Americans did not give up; they set up a “prayer pilgrimage day”.  During this pilgrimage they gave up the use of automobiles and taxis and walked the streets in protest.  Reverend Ralph D.

Luther goes on to say that since it had rained all day, this had kept some people from coming out and voting, primarily the older men of the community. There ended up being a two vote split between the two candidates, William C. Cleveland and Samuel Stradley, and Luther blamed that on the fact that they lost some of their voters due to the rain. Cleveland then claimed the election since he believed that “the students did not have a right to vote here and says he is going to have it contested and talking of carrying it to court”.

When Ferebee returns he is surprised to find that his mother has once again been sold. This time he has no idea where to find his family and feels alone and depressed.","The twenty-four page autobiography of Reverend Ferebee demonstrates the effects, of slavery. Textbook accounts of slavery fail to teach us that the thirteenth amendment did not simply solve all of the pain and hurt the families underwent. Slavery separated several families and it tore young children from their mothers. When discussing slavery most people speak of the pain that slaves underwent when working out in the fields such as being expected to pick between 100 to 200 pounds of cotton and when being beat by their masters. But, they rarely speak of the emotional pain they went through. Reading diaries and autobiographies helps people begin to feel what the slaves had to go through for so long."],"display_date":1882,"search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":9846,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5058,"title":"A Slave Reminisces","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/36","end_date":"12/31/38","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Agatha Babino was born a slave of Ogis Guidry near Carenco, Louisiana.  She was at least 87 years old when she was interviewed by a member of the Depression-era WPA Federal Writers’ Project sometime between 1936 and 1938.  In a mere two pages of her recorded reminisce about her time as a slave, Babino addressed many of the topics common to a slave’s life.","Babino described the plantation where she was born as “a big place, I ‘spect a mile ‘cross it, and fifty slaves.”  This number of slaves placed Babino’s owner solidly in the ranks of Southern gentry, a man who had more slaves than about 90 percent of all slave-owners.  This is further reinforced by the fact that the ideal number of slaves for an agricultural unit was between 30 and 60, a number few slaveholders ever achieved.  On the other hand, Babino’s experience was not unusual because more than half of all slaves in the South belonged to the largest slaveholders.","One of Babino’s memories was the “shabby houses” the slaves had to live in.  She described them as “builded of logs” with dirt floors.  Housing for slaves was generally poor, and Babino’s memory of a bed that was a plank with moss was in keeping with standard conditions.   Slaves were an investment, and any additional costs reduced the value of that investment.  An 1846 statement from Louisiana planters of the usual expenses of a sugar plantation showed that an overseer was paid a salary ($400) almost as great as the annual expenditure of food and clothing for 15 slaves ($450).","Babino also recalled having Sundays and Christmas free, although on most other holidays her master had guests, creating more work for the slaves.  This too was a common experience for slaves.  On these occasions Babino remembered dancing outside to a fiddle and banjo, even sometimes visiting other plantations.  This required a pass or else the patrollers would beat them.  Patrols were a necessary part of enforcing the Slave Codes.  An adaptation of the militia, free white men were called to serve a period of some months to apprehend out of place slaves, monitor slave gatherings, and search for evidence of potential uprisings and other related tasks.","Beatings were as essential a part of slavery as the patrols.  Babino said that her master “beat us till we bleed.  He rub salt and red pepper in.”  She told a story of how the “young miss” came home from college and chose to slap her.  She would have gone farther but Babino’s mother offered to take the beating instead.  There were few legal protections for slaves, and even those were seldom enforced.  It is perhaps not surprising then that Babino’s aunt was one of the many slaves who reacted to the brutality of the plantation by running away, just as it doesn’t surprise to hear she was caught and beaten more.","Babino was intimately affected by many of the issues that concerned African-Americans.  She remembered soldiers on both sides of the Civil War: the Confederates who mistook her master’s son for a Yankee because of his blue coat and took his gun, and the Yankees who “take corn and gooses and hosses.”  After the war the Ku Klux Klan killed her uncle for not voting Democrat in an election.   As for herself, she left the plantation she grew up on, married, had twelve children, and eventually ended up in Beaumont, Texas, to be interviewed about her life."],"display_date":"1936 -

Some claimed he was one of the first martyrs of the American Revolution.  During the American Revolution, several regiments were formed by order of George Washington using slaves.  Those who served to fight for the Continental Armies would receive wages and, when their service had ended, freedom.  Freedom was granted to slaves by not just General Washington, but several other leaders in the Continental Army.  Even among the great men who gave freedom to the hard-working slaves, emancipation for all slaves did not come for centuries afterwards.","This subject was something William C. Nell wanted to show in his book <em>The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution, With Sketches of Several Distinguished Colored Persons. </em>William Nell was an abolitionist of the ninteenth century who avidly studied the history of African Americans, mulattoes, and all other men of African descent.  He was a free African American, who was prejudiced while educating himself.  He worked avidly to integrate schools so that African American children  could study alongside white Americans.  He also took an interest in history, avidly learning all about the history of African Americans and his heritage.  He worked with William Lloyd Garrison and the <em>Liberator</em> for many years, wrote several books and articles promoting emancipation and integration, and diligently pressed for the integration of black and white students in Massachusetts.","His books bring up an interesting point though: in an age born from the American Revolution, there were so much pro-slavery movements.  Slaves and free blacks had actively worked to fight for their freedom and to protect their own nation.  Moreover, many were given that freedom.  It seems ironic, looking through this history, that the issue with slavery continued even until the Civil War.  It is true that the South had become dependent on slaves for their plantations, however, this feeling among slave owners that slaves had no equal standing rivals that of the great leaders giving their slaves freedom.  Truly, the War for Independence was a war fought by all and for all who sought a new nation and freedom.","Michael Kammen mentions Nell as someone who was dedicated to bringing memory of black soldiers to the American culture.  Nell's work in preserving African American history is astounding, and his work has been used to research the African American slave culture.  He was able to bring to light all the reasons why slaves should be given freedom, if not for their service to the cause of freedom."],"display_date":"January 1, 1855","search_date":"1855-01-01","locations":[{"id":6209,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":365,"tag":"Emancipation"},{"id":193,"tag":"Abolitionism"},{"id":625,"tag":"Revolutionary War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5084,"title":"The Price of Slavery","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-02","end_date":"1847-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["To a group of slaves about to be sold to a new owner, the future is uncertain. Their new home may promise decent food and board, or it may mean the separation from their closest family members, abusive overseers, and grueling work that drives them to the brink of death. This is what thirteen slaves faced when they were sold on January 2, 1847 by John D. McCullough to Samuel W. Evans. The document promised their ownership by Evans until their death or his, at which time his heirs would take further ownership of any surviving slaves. In addition, McCullough promises in the contract that he will defend the ownership by Evans of these people against any person who claims otherwise. The insights these provide into antebellum Southern society are many.","The fact that McCullough includes his defense of ownership in the contract shows us the state of the Southern economy at this time. Slaves made up a majority of the livelihood, providing the region with the largest portion of its economic output. Runaways could be a problem, but those recaptured were returned to their owners. However, there is the chance that, like any other form of property, dishonest men could capture the runaway slaves and call them their own. The inclusion of a witness to the sale of slaves in Evans’ contract shows how important it was to protect their means of an income, all the way until and through their death, guaranteeing their children and families a way to continue making money as well. This also provides another possibility. In the case that a slave runs away and is found among abolitionists, a slave owner would have the proof needed to show that the man or woman had escaped and, according to the later Fugitive Slave Act, had to be returned to his or her rightful owner.","In addition, it is important to note the price that these men and women sold for. The total amount for the slaves was listed as $5,300 – about $408 per slave. This was less than large slave markets, such as those in New Orleans, where slaves could go for up to $1,200, but the fact that this was a private sale means more bargaining was involved. However, this leads to another problem; slaves were hyperaware of their value as a commodity. At the war’s end, when these people were looking for work in labor as free agents, they would ask for the same prices that they had garnered before the war; however, white plantation owners were unwilling to pay such prices, leaving both ends in a poor position: the newly freed blacks without work, and the whites without labor to work their fields. The Southern economy would be destroyed for years to come as both groups of people struggled to make sense of their new situations."],"display_date":"January 2, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-02","locations":[{"id":11495,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":768,"tag":"Prices"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5221,"title":"<strong>Soldier Resists Segregation on Birmingham Streetcar</strong>","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"6/6/23","end_date":"6/6/46","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During World War II , whites and blacks had sacrificed for their country; yet, only the whites who returned found themselves recipients of respect. Around 9:40pm on June 6, 1943 a “negro” soldier boarded a streetcar in Birmingham, Alabama on the North Birmingham Line. Instead of moving to the back of the car, he chose to stand in the white section. White passengers began to complain and the conductor told him to move back to the negro section. After some “questionable language”, the soldier refused, stating he was going to the station where his troop train was waiting.  With some coaxing, the soldier finally moved back, but not entirely out of the white section. At the next stop, a few more negroes boarded the train. The soldier threw himself across the seats stopping these men from moving to the back of the train. The conductor opened the doors and told him to get off. After a small altercation, the soldier hit the conductor and fled.","According to leading historians, this was a common experience for black soldiers returning home to Birmingham and other cities during and after the war. Although they had earned the respect of their commanders while fighting for their country, at home they were still viewed as second class citizens. Forced to face humiliation at the hands of white streetcar conductors and passengers, they resisted. Sometimes their resistance came in the form of calling others to stand with them in defiance. More often than not their calls were in vain. For too long black citizens had attempted to resist racial segregation on streetcars and failed. With time however, their demands for equality coalesced into an unstoppable force.","From the emergence of streetcar lines, the races had been at odds over sharing transportation. When attempts to provide separate cars failed, it was decided that cars would have to be shared albeit divided. On May 3, 1923, Birmingham Railway, Light, and Power Co. requisitioned its first set of racial partitions for 184 of its streetcars. In a formal gesture they were stating that there would “now” be segregated transportation. This was the case all across the country. Cities were formally segregating their streetcars in an attempt to quell violence between the races while maintaining their transportation systems. However, this system of racial separation would not fulfill its goal. Twenty years later, soldiers like this one and black civilians alike were still resisting racial segregation of streetcars."],"display_date":"June 6, 1923 - June 6, 1946","search_date":"1934-12-05","locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5235,"title":"An African American Worker at Sloss Furnace Encounters the Color Line","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/25","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["'\"A nigger can't bid for a white man's job.\" was how Alonzo Gaines described labor divisions among African Americans and whites at the time he was employed at Sloss Furnaces in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1984 Gaines sat down in an interview with the Sloss Furnace Association with the goal of recording his thoughts on his career at Sloss Furnaces, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. In the course of his interview he recounted his own personal experiences with this workplace segregation. According to Gaines while he was employed at the concrete plant he had been instructed to operate a machine called the compressor when it usual operator, a man by the name of McDonald, was off work. Eventually the position of compressor operator became open and interested workers began applying for the position, or as they called it, biding on the job. Gaines too applied as he had already been operating the compressor for some time but when he approached the superintendent, a man by the name of Lawson, he was summarily denied the position in favor a white applicant. Superintendent Lawson informed Gaines frankly, “You can run it just as good as McCan, but you ain't gonna get it.\"","The “Color Line” that Gaines had encountered served as a barrier to African American workplace advancement in the south for decades. The south had developed strict delineations between what were considered “white” and “black” positions. According to historian William A. Sundstrom the color line segregated African Americans and whites, “along lines of skill levels, supervisory responsibilities, and manual versus white-collar tasks,” in many industries. It was implicitly understood and, as Gaines testimony shows, sometime explicitly stated that an African American worker would not have a supervisory position over a white worker. This is exactly what happened to Gaines when he applied for the compressor operator position; despite having the necessary skills to operate the machine he was told upfront that he would never get the position. That position was considered a “white job” and Gaines was denied the opportunity simply because of an ingrained prejudice that placed some positions at a higher social status that would then denied to those who were considered lower in social rank, even inspite of their proven capacity to perform the work required of that position."],"display_date":"1925 - 1950","search_date":"1937-12-31","locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5271,"title":"Black Family Challenges Racial Barriers in Suburb","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On August 13, 1957, Daisy and Bill Myers moved their family to a well-developed suburb in Levittown, Pennsylvania.  They were just like every other eager newcomer to arrive in Levittown, except that they were black.  As news of this Levittown “first” quickly spread, so did the curiosity.  Drivers continuously circled the house in their automobiles, trying to catch a glimpse of the first African American residents of Levittown.  Other interested citizens gathered near the house to share in their disbelief.  Only hours after the family moved in, violence erupted in the traditionally quiet community.  This “Levittown Incident” was documented in a <em>New York Times</em> article from August 25, 1957, revealing the racism that plagued this sprawling suburban community.  A mere two days after the family had started preparing the house for the move, an angry crowd of 200 residents formed outside the home.  Demonstrators hurled stones at the house, shattering two panes of the picture window.  Police arrived on the scene to break up the crowd.  As Levittown historian David Kushner noted, “It was the first time in twenty-nine years a sheriff had been called in to restore order. But order wouldn’t come easily.”  More disapproving Levittowners returned to the Myers house the next evening.  In fact, as the <em>New York Times</em> reported, “Demonstrations continued almost nightly.”  Time and again, police arrived at the scene to suppress riots.  With the police protecting the house, “An uneasy peace descended on the neighborhood.”  However, the bitter reality of Northern racism remained.","With their innovative mass-production techniques, the housing developer Levitt & Sons helped alleviate the post-World War II housing crisis.  Despite the promise of affordable housing for all Americans, the company excluded blacks from their communities.  “This pattern of racial exclusion was set in 1947,” wrote historian Alexander O. Boulton.  However, William Levitt defended his company’s continued support of racial covenants.  As cited by historian Joshua Ruff, Levitt declared, “‘We can solve a housing problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem. But we cannot combine the two.’”  Thus, Levittown, Pennsylvania remained an all-white community.  “I have come to know that if we sell one house to a Negro family, then 90 to 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community. That is their attitude, not ours,” remarked Levitt in the <em>New York Times</em>.  However, as pointed out in the newspaper, “the builders had no say over the resale of houses.”  This is where the Myers family entered the picture.","In August 1957, a tight-knit, pleasant community became the scene of vicious uprisings.  The riots highlighted the bitter racial tensions of the time and revealed the legitimacy of Levitt’s concerns; Levittowners were not ready to welcome blacks into their community.  As noted by Kushner, Daisy Myers remembered picking up the little culprit that broke her window.  “‘The rock, weighing less than an ounce,’ as Daisy put it, ‘carried tons of hatred with it.’”  Such hatred rocked the town for weeks."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5272,"title":"Whites Riot in Response to Arrival of First African American Family in Levittown, PA","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Upon driving up to their new home at 43 Deepgreen Lane, Daisy Myers was filled with doubt, recalling that she repeatedly asked herself, “what would be the extent of our ostracism? Would we be able to sleep comfortably?” as she studied the four law officers standing on the lawn of her address in the Dogwood Hollow Section of Levittown. These questions regarding the neighborhood reaction to the arrival of a black family in what had been an intentionally all-white enclave, were unfortunately answered over the next two weeks. At dusk each evening, crowds of people gathered outside the Myer’s home, angrily shouting and jeering, singing the national Anthem, and throwing stones toward the Myer’s home, as apparently these “spacious skies,” they sang of were not meant to be enjoyed in an integrated setting. Levittown police failed to enforce the court ordered protection for the Myers, prohibiting more than three people from assembling near the residence at once. Mobs consequently gathered in this fashion each night, only finally subsiding due to interference from the state police. After an agonizing fourteen days, the riots ended, but the Myers continued to suffer the anxiety of the consequences triggered by the introduction of integration to Levittown. Harassment of the family persisted for almost three months, as Daisy Myers received threatening phone calls of those who “told [her] they threatened to shoot William down on sight,” the family’s deliveries of oil, bread, and milk stopped arriving, and the more than occasional unfriendly white stroller-by forced the Myers to have constant protection, or at the very least, sympathizing company. Anti-segregationist even obtained property immediately neighboring the Myers’ home, using the location to intimidate the family further, evident by their conspicuous display of the confederate flag.","The resistance seen in the August riots against the integration of Levittown, PA was not uncommon throughout suburban neighborhoods. Quite the contrary in fact, racial discrimination and the subsequent segregated communities were the norm in 1950s suburbia. Yet despite this plaguing harassment, the Myers refused to leave their Levittown home, justifiably feeling entitled “to live where [they] chose,” as William put it. Remarking on the family’s incredible determination to outlast their opponents, Dianne Harris, historian and author of <em>Second Suburb: Levittown, PA, </em>stated<em>, </em>“the Myers endured an ordeal that few could have weathered with such dignity, courage, grace, and fortitude.”"," ","This endurance allowed the family to break “the lily-white pattern of Levittown,” as Daisy Myers stated, a pattern that William Levitt had attempted to keep in existence in his planned suburban community. While he did not consider himself to hold racist ideals, Levitt had long refused to sell his homes to African Americans. Applications for home ownership in Levittown had to be made in person at the Levittown Exhibit Center Sales Office, allowing discrimination in the housing industry of the community to readily continue daily. Yet through the assistance received from the American Friends Service Committee, the Myers were able to circumvent these discriminatory practices, making headway in the racial trends of the neighborhood. Yet due to the overpowering ideals of many white residents, in combination with the ideals of Levitt and his employed real estate agents, the effects of the inequality are still seen in Levittown today, as the 2000 census identified ninety-eight percent of the town’s population as Caucasian."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5273,"title":"Levittown Real Estate Boards' Discriminatory Housing Practices Revealed","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/7/54","end_date":"8/7/54","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article published in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> in August of 1954 journalist Craig Thompson exposed the “problem of Negro exclusion,” commenting on the discriminatory practices employed by Levitt and the preventive covenants established by the local real estate boards within his suburban communities. As the father of modern suburbia, it seemed that with his prepackaged communities, he had also manufactured the ideal enclave for whites opposed to an integrated neighborhood – an enclave that beginning in the mid-1950s, was finally exposed for the inequalities of opportunity it had maintained.","Revolutionizing the housing industry, Levitt pioneered the affordable, planned suburban community, beginning his construction endeavors on the potato fields of Hempstead Plains on Long Island. With the mass production of homes, Levitt enabled past renters of urban-dwellings to become homeowners, an “embodiment of the American dream,” according to Kyle Sabo, a lifelong resident of the area. With this revolution of the housing industry, Levitt was praised by the media, with early articles and interviews speaking of the visionary vertical organization that Levitt employed in construction. Yet as the racist ploys throughout Levittown expanded, Levitt’s reputation shifted from a genius businessman to a prejudicial one, driven by his antagonistic views toward blacks and other minorities.","In the interview Thompson conducted with Levitt in 1954, the businessman denied any racist attitudes toward the black community. He defended his tactics as nothing more than techniques that were best for his business, stating, “as a company, [his] position was simple: [he] could solve a housing problem, or [he] could try to solve a racial problem. But [he] could not combine the two.”","Despite such claims however, the growing racist policies of Levitt’s suburbias could no longer escape public knowledge. Property owners, pressured into such contracts that prevented them from leasing or selling to blacks in the future had became common practice in Levittown. Residents were warned that violation of these conditions would not only result in penalty for themselves, but would cause an “invasion” of blacks into the town, bringing with it lower property values, crime, and danger to the very essence of suburbia. Even intermingling with blacks became dangerous, as Levitt evicted white families on the basis of welcoming black company in their suburban home.","With exposure of such practices, not surprisingly, came a growing opposition. In both Levitt’s Long Island community and his Bucks County community, resistance to segregation, as well as to blockbusting, grew. In Freeport, Long Island 240 white residents signed a petition, refusing to be solicited by local real estate agents. Black newspapers across the Bucks County area, notably the <em>Tribune, </em>issued articles filled with commentary of how Levitt’s towns were “breeding hate.” The Society of Friends became dedicated to circumventing the restrictive policies in place, successfully enabling the move-in of the first African American family to Levittown, PA in 1957. Such efforts alarmed whites opposed to integration, as uncovering of the problem increasingly incited reformist sentiment throughout such neighborhoods.","Despite the exposure, and accompanying intentions of challenging such policies, however, the suburban neighborhood of the 1950s served as the forerunner for what would become the trend across American suburbias for years to come. In the following decades, white communities throughout the country, aided by federal policy and the real estate agency, “protected” suburbia for themselves, fearful of the idea of an integrated community seeping into this type of residential setting. The effects have by no means disappeared in modern times, as the impact of such actions are still felt in Long Island’s Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as throughout Bucks county, which display significant racial disparities, regrettably referred to by residents as “a checkerboard of racially, ethnically, and economically segregated communities.”"," "],"display_date":"August 7, 1954","search_date":"1954-08-07","locations":[{"id":28529,"lat":40.9562853666,"lng":-73.0371992045,"zoom":9,"place":"Suffolk, New York"},{"id":29305,"lat":40.6374264514,"lng":-73.5488485883,"zoom":10,"place":"Nassau, New York"},{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5327,"title":"Freedmen Massacred at Opelousas","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-09-28","end_date":"1868-09-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Opelousas massacre occurred in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, on September 28, 1868.

Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range.","The Freedman’s Bureau ordered Lieutenant Lee to investigate the atmosphere of Opelousas. In an article written on October 8, Lee described the cause of the riot and the death count. He gave a low estimate in regards to the number of blacks killed, stating that only five died, but expressed his opinion that the death toll would increase due to blacks being unwilling to give up their arms to whites. Ultimately, Lee was positive in his reports, he believed that peace had been restored overall and stated, “no further trouble is apprehended.”","The end of the Civil War resulted in widespread violence in the South due to racial and political tensions. A majority of newly freed African Americans strongly supported the Republican Party, angering prominent southern Democrats. The inability to accept racial equality led to the growth of white supremacist groups, the most noteworthy being the Ku Klux Klan. White radicals sought to silence African Americans and those who supported them through various scare tactics and physical violence, such was the case at Opelousas.","Historian Carolyn DeLatte argued that the white Southerners acted in the same manner that they had for many years. This time, however, “the vengeance visited upon the Negroe population was greater, as blacks were no longer protected by any consideration of their monetary value.” The riot echoed its influence in the political as well as social arena, where whites bounded together to protect their rights from black infringement, and blacks stepped away from their right to vote in order to evade persecution."],"display_date":"September 28, 1868 - September 29, 1868","search_date":"1868-09-28","locations":[{"id":5698,"lat":30.5481655437,"lng":-92.2423441161,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LANDRY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5351,"title":"Rebel General Gantt Tells Arkansas to Return to the Union","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-08","end_date":"1863-11-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Confederate Brigadier General E.W. Gantt spoke to his fellow citizens of Arkansas, but also to all of the citizens of the South in his 1863 address.  The message in this address is that the Confederacy was fighting a war that they could never win and that the southern states would have more power and property if they would just return to the Union.  The General blamed several of the problems in the Confederacy on Jefferson Davis, for whom he had little respect.  He described Davis as “Cold, selfish, and supremely ambitious.”  Gantt also pointed out that the Confederacy was not sufficient in terms of foreign policy and he called Davis’s ideas “a stupid failure.”","Gantt urged those in the South at the time to give up the fight and return to the Union.  He felt that surrender was sometimes the best option and that southerners should look past ideas of humiliation.  He explained his reasoning by saying, “Our armies are melting and ruin approaches us.  Will continuing this struggle help us?”  The General also felt that the North had too much invested in the war to give up the fight and that it was foolish of southerners to think that they ever will.","Gantt sought to reason with citizens of the South by claiming that, “Each day makes new graves, new orphans, and new mourners.  Each hour flings into this dreadful whirlpool of wrecked hopes, broken fortunes, and anguished hearts.”  He also explained that, “Negro slavery has accomplished its mission here,” in an attempt to show southern whites that slavery was not something that could continue to be sustainable.","The most interesting thing about E.W. Gantt was that he had been an ardent supporter of the secessionist movement prior to the war.  Even before the secession of the southern states Gantt proclaimed, “My life, my all, and laying them upon her altar, offering them up freely in defense of her insulted honor, wounded pride, and priceless freedom.”  It is interesting to hear Gantt’s thoughts about the South prior to the war and his decision to become a Union loyalist.","Despite Gantt’s pre-war beliefs it is apparent that he would stick to his newfound Unionist ideology.  He became the Arkansas state prosecutor for the Little Rock Reconstruction authorities.  The former General also served as a supervisor for the Freedman’s Bureau in Southwest Arkansas from 1865 to 1866.   Gantt ended his life working on a state law digest for Arkansas for which he was appointed by the Governor to complete.","Bruce S. Allardice claimed that Gantt’s defection may have been due to one of several causes such as cowardice, insobriety, opportunism, and immorality to name a few.  It seemed obscure whether or not Gantt defected because of his belief in Union virtues or because of the reasons listed above.  Nevertheless, Gantt is an interesting character because he was the only Confederate General to switch sides during the war."],"display_date":"November 8, 1863 - November 9, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-08","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5341,"title":"The <em>Freedmen’s Record </em>Reports on the Prosperity of Freedmen","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-10-01","end_date":"1865-10-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to the <em>Freedmen’s Record</em> report, many southerners perceived freedmen as “a hopelessly lazy, sensual creature who, if he has enough to satisfy the lowest animal wants, will be content.” They feared that freedmen would resort to theft instead of working to fulfill their needs.  The<em> Record</em> attempted to change these perceptions by exposing the tremendous success of freed African Americans in the North.  This is observed when the <em>Record </em>stated, “the amount of crime committed by this class of persons is much less than that committed by white men.”","The <em>Freedmen’s Record </em>was a monthly publication by the New England Freedman’s Aid Society, which worked to point out the hard work and success of many freedmen.  In the October 1865 issue, the statistical research of Dr. J.

Radical Republicans were unhappy with former Confederates gaining power and influence under Governor Wells. Wells himself eventually noticed the power shift and became uncomfortable with it as well. In 1866 the legislature of Louisiana called new elections, allowing for a former Confederate mayor to regain his title. The state legislature overturned Wells’ veto. As a result, Wells gave his support to a Radical plan to reassemble the constitutional convention that occurred in 1864. The Radical plan would grant power to blacks, prevent former Confederates from voting, and lay the foundation for a modified state government for Louisiana.","Those opposed to the idea of Louisiana becoming a “revolutionized” state, the city police force of New Orleans, which was comprised of Confederate veterans, was supposed to maintain order during the convention but supported the opponents of Radicals. On July 30, twenty-five delegates and 200 black supporters, consisting primarily of former veterans, convened in New Orleans. When the two sides met, fighting broke out followed by gunshots. The delegates took cover in the convention hall. Those who tried to escape were immediately shot, the white flags they held in their hands as a sign of surrender were ignored. The total death toll consisted of thirty-four blacks and three white Radicals to be killed. Around 100 people were injured in the riot.","The <em>New York Times</em> described the event as a dispute between angry radicals and thugs, the police force, describing them as, “unprincipled scoundrels, thirsting for blood, whose every moral sensibility had been blunted by lives of desperados, were maddened to informal rage by injudicious harangues from men who follow in the stormy wake of Sumner and Stevens.” Republicans reported that the death toll was around 200 men, a fact in which the article questioned.  The Military Commission went  in to investigate the riot and the <em>Times </em>argued that the instigators would be deemed guilty due to the close allegiance that members of the Commission had with the Radicals.","Historian Eric Foner argued the significance of the New Orleans riot, stating, that it completely took away any hope of Presidential Reconstruction in Louisiana.

The events at Colfax resulted in only three men to convicted. However, disagreement led to the case entering the Supreme Court in the form of <em>United States v. Cruikshank </em>in 1876. The case brought in to question the constitutionality of the Enforcement Acts. It questioned if the federal government had the jurisdiction to enforce these acts on the state level.","The Enforcement Acts were issued in 1870 and 1871; they sought to prevent intimidation of voters and discrimination based on one’s skin color. The Acts also issued specific crimes committed by the Ku Klux Klan as federal offenses and those who committed them would be punished based on federal standards. Many white Southerners believed the Enforcement Acts were a violation of State’s rights. During the <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank </em>Supreme Court case, Attorney General Williams argued that the Enforcement Acts were necessary to protect the right to vote for African Americans. Williams argued that government could not exist without votes from its citizens, and as citizens, African Americans deserve the opportunity to cast their vote. He stated, “If Congress has no power to protect the voters, then the White League of Louisiana, a minority of the people, can stand around the polls and prevent the majority from voting.”","The results of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em> were devastating for those in support of the Enforcement Act. The men were charged with using their power to halt African Americans from voting. However, the government did not charge them with using race as a motive in the massacre. The error in wording resulted in the three men to going free, leaving no one held responsible for the horrific massacre against the freedmen.","The Court went further to state that the federal government only had the right to prohibit the violations of black rights in states only, they did not hold the power for punishing criminal acts committed by individuals, the state and local authority held this right. Historian Eric Foner commented, “In the name of federalism, the decision rendered national prosecution of crimes committed against blacks virtually impossible, and gave a green light to acts of terror where local officials either could not or would not enforce the law.” The devastating result of <em>U.S. v.

He felt that they could if they had the chance to work and earn money on their own. Still believed that he could gather statistical information that would be strong enough to refute claims of black inferiority by testing intelligence and gathering stories from those he had helped on the Underground Railroad.","Pennsylvania became a safe haven for blacks in the mid to late 1800s because of the increased involvement of private organizations and groups of people such as the Quakers.  Quakers in southeastern Pennsylvania helped an unknown number slaves reach freedom and refused to aid in the retrieval of escaped slaves, even after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the penalties that went along with it.  With the help from people such as Still, blacks would receive a warm welcome and a helping hand to freedom in the state.","William Still helped several slaves on their way to freedom through Pennsylvania.  He also did what he could to speak out about slavery and everything that he believed to be wrong with the institution.  Still was one of a group of pioneers in the United States who believed that slavery was not only atrocious but also completely immoral.  His work was all aimed towards the goal of ending slavery in the United States."],"display_date":"November 25, 1857","search_date":"1857-11-25","locations":[{"id":11229,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5402,"title":"Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment Examined by HEW","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"7/26/72","end_date":"7/26/72","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 26, 1972 <em>The Alton Evening Telegraph, </em>a newspaper in Alton, Illinois<em>, </em>released an article discussing The Department of Health Education and Welfare's investigation of the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment. Although the experiment was conducted in Alabama, the news was a national story. Jean Heller, the author of the article, found this study so disturbing that she decided to report on it. The experiment’s purpose was to study the effects of syphilis on the human body. The investigation was sparked because the participants of the study, 600 black men, were denied proper medical treatment for their ailments. Dr. Merlin K. Duval announced the investigation; he stated he wanted to investigate why the study lasted so long. The study started in 1932 and lasted until 1972. Public Health Service officials questioned the morality of the study because the study continued after penicillin had been proven to be the cure for the disease. While seeking subjects for the study Dr. Raymond Vonderlehr searched the largely illiterate, poverty-stricken population of sharecroppers and tenant farmers. The individuals participating in the study were all poor black males.","There were 600 participants divided into three groups: 200 not suffering from syphilis, 200 with the disease and treated with the best methods known at the time and 200 not treated for syphilis at all. After the investigation began the investigators determined that of the 400 men infected with syphilis none of them were treated. The pre-penicillin treatment for syphilis consisted mainly of arsenic and mercury injections, and a death rate of 1 in 100 was considered good. Dr. J.D. Millar, chief of the venereal disease branch of Atlanta's CDC, believed \"the moral problem, if any in 1932 was very vague because the risk of treatment was in the minds of physicians worse than the disease\". Millar is in charge of the remains of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.","In a 1968 Hastings Center Report, Allan Brandt stated that in retrospect the study \"revealed more about the pathology of racism than about the pathology of syphilis\". The study was widely reported without arousing any significant protest in the medical community. Brandt suggested that there needs to be more attentiveness in evaluating the specific ways in which social values and attitudes affect professional behavior. Heller agrees with Brandt because she suggests that racism was one of if not the only reason behind the study."],"display_date":"July 26, 1972","search_date":"1972-07-26","locations":[{"id":34382,"lat":38.8298808603,"lng":-89.9051581527,"zoom":9,"place":"Madison, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1237,"tag":"Tuskegee"},{"id":1238,"tag":"Syphilis"},{"id":1239,"tag":"Study"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5454,"title":"<strong>When Will It Ever Change?</strong>","course_id":86,"status":"P","start_date":"7/11/30","end_date":"7/11/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["News stories relating ‘death by accident,’ ‘murder by one of own’ or even an ‘unsolved mystery’ are just too far-fetched to explain the discovery of so many ‘Negro’ bodies found in the swamps or in uninhabited places in 1930.  It is inconceivable to think that the white tyrannical press believe that we are fooled by their fabrications about the missing southern ‘Negro’ workers,” as reported in <em>The New York Times</em>. “This inhumanity against the ‘blacks’ must be stopped.  It is the twentieth century!  It is simply ridiculous to think that in this modern age, these atrocious mob killings are continuing to occur.” Outraged reactions of shock and frustration burst from the members of the <em>American ‘Negro’</em> <em>Labor Congress</em> <em>(ANLC). </em>Therefore, with a passionate fervour, the commitment to continue to seek out new strategies to eliminate these acts of violence are renewed as well as plans being made to quickly implement the new approaches through publicity campaigns and press releases.","These statements of disbelief from the <em>ANLC</em> were published in the <em>New York Times</em> on July 11, 1930 as a response to the eighteen African Americans who had been lynched in the first seven months of 1930.  This appalling statistic made it very obvious that the primary goal of eradicating the practice of lynching needed to be their top priority, especially when combined with the eleven African Americans who had been lynched in 1929. Unfortunately, in spite of the three attempts for an anti-lynching bill that successfully passed through the House of Representatives, it continued to fail in the Senate. Lynching was protected under the Constitution as it protected the right of local government to control crime thus giving them freedom from interference or scrutiny.","The early twentieth century was the era of ‘The Declaration of Principles,’ a call to “restoring to ‘blacks’ the right to vote, an end to racial segregation, and complete equality in economic and educational opportunity”  created under the leadership of W.E.B. Du Bois, being adopted in 1905. Yet, as African Americans began to show assertiveness and independence, racial tensions were amplified and whites reacted in violence, in order to maintain their white supremacy.  Horrifically, more than 5,000 African Americans were lynched by white mobs between 1882 and 1932, with the express purpose being to “terrify ‘Negroes’ as to dissuade them from ever asserting themselves or their rights.” Incredibly, the lack of concern over the murder of thousands of African Americans was because whites believed that their lives were cheap and “inherently and permanently inferior,” to the point of being as low in value as animals. In fact, lynchings were committed by respected and regular citizens and celebrated as social events attended by families. The real horror about this period in American history is that, regrettably, racism would continue to raise its ugly head for three more decades before many of the African Americans dreams for true freedom and equality would begin to be realized through the crusades led by Martin Luther King, Jr.  <br /><br />"],"display_date":"July 11, 1930","search_date":"1930-07-11","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"}],"course":{"name":"US History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":86,"school_id":28}},{"id":5488,"title":"<strong>Effectively Speaking: Booker T.

He looked into a sea of anxious white faces and felt the collection of Black expectant stares. With a stoic purpose Booker T. Washington addressed the crowd. His speech commenced not only the start of the trade fair, but the beginning of a new ideology for Black Americans.","Placating the white associations who helped form the exposition, Washington first expressed his appreciation for their benevolence. “I but convey to you, Mr. President and Directors, the sentiment of the masses of my race,” Washington assured, “when I say that in no way have the value and manhood of the American Negro been more fittingly and generously recognized, than by the managers of this magnificent Exposition at every stage of its progress.” Continuing to appease his audience, he voiced his ready acceptance of social segregation.

Washington instructed, “To those of my race who depend on bettering their condition […] I would say cast down your bucket where you are […] cast it down in agriculture, in mechanics, in commerce, in domestic service and in the professions.” Washington also forewarned, “We shall contribute one third to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding every effort to advance the body politic.” Booker T. Washington advocated for production to refocus the aims of his people.

The speech’s theme emphasized Washington’s idea of “a new era of industrial progress” while at the same time defining key roles for Black Americans.

Elliot, from the very same school district, ruled that segregated schools were not equal  because of the lack of resources at black school, specifically, they had no buses.","Briggs v. Elliot was combined with 4 other cases in 1954, including Brown v. Board, that were collectively decided by the watershed Supreme Court ruling that segregated schools were inherently unequal. At the time of the 1953 highway crash though, the court-ordered, federally enforced, desegregation of schools in South Carolina hardly seemed clear or imminent in the state’s future.","The teenage bus-drivers involved in the highway crash, were in fact, coming to and from “equalization” schools; the Manning Training School, where Willie Lemon had just dropped off a bus full of black students, was built the same year as the accident. Equalization schools were a massively expensive project undertaken by the State of South Carolina after the Briggs v. Eliot case to avoid the desegregation decision NAACP lawyers were successfully building.","The decision to employ teenage bus-drivers, though one way of cutting costs in the convoluted and costly equalization school project, was beginning to receive scrutiny from the companies that insured South Carolina school buses. The January 21st accident intensified this criticism.","The accident happened because the young and inexperienced drivers collided head on the “pea-soup” fog conditions on the highway that morning. The thick haze that clouded the moment made for treacherous conditions, where the drivers couldn’t see the road ahead of them, and in that spirit perhaps, was the entire moment between the Briggs v. Elliot and Brown v. Board landmarks in South Carolina history."," "],"display_date":"January 20, 1953","search_date":"1953-01-20","locations":[{"id":28318,"lat":33.6657929366,"lng":-80.2164264171,"zoom":9,"place":"Clarendon, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":43,"tag":"Desegregation"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":746,"tag":"Supreme Court"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"},{"id":939,"tag":"Public Schools"},{"id":84,"tag":"Black History"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":572,"tag":"Buses"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":91,"school_id":4}},{"id":5542,"title":"Bus Driver, Age 18, Killed in Head-On Collision At Work","course_id":91,"status":"P","start_date":"1/20/53","end_date":"1/20/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The certificate kept by the Clarendon Memorial Hospital records the death of Willie Lemon, an 18-year-old bus driver involved in a head-on collision on the highway near Jordan, South Carolina, on January 20, 1953.

Historian Allan Coggins, in <em>Tennessee Tragedies</em>, shows that some of the prisoners admitted to, “conspiring to rise up against the whites of Gibson County.” Coggins also states that the foiled conspiracy was tied to the, “unrestrained actions of the local KKK.”","Jefferson Davis expressed his disgust at the vigilantism by invoking the Confederate war dead and warned the crowd not to have let them die in vain. Speaking of the humanitarian responsibility to oppose such violence, Davis alluded that it was what, “You owe to the gallant dead who fell for the sacred cause of Southern Independence.” Davis appealed to the honor and reputation of the Southern men and society stating, “Never has a country been more truly in a condition of having lost all save its honor, and you men of the Counties of Jackson, Grundy, Polk, and many others of wide reputation, may be expected to denounce whatever would stain the honor and whatever would tarnish the fair name of the living.” Davis attempted to stop further violence by appealing to the beaten Confederates’ pride, strong even in defeat. Only a few years earlier, Jefferson Davis was the leader of a rebellion that fundamentally supported slavery, and yet in Memphis in 1874 he claimed that, “The negroes were my friends in the olden times.

She was interviewed in her later years as a part of the slave narratives taken when she was free. One story she related was of a Sunday when she attended a wedding for her master’s kinfolks. The bride walked into the church and someone kicked dust onto the bride’s dress, but it was not Graves. She, however, got blamed for it and the master’s wife whipped her. In reality, she believed that the master’s daughter, Puss, kicked the dust onto the bride’s dress. Nevertheless, she endured, “the worst whippin’ I ever got. The worst whippin’ in my whole life an’ I still got the marks on my body.” When they all got home, the master meant to whip her again. Graves remembered, “…I got mad, an’ told him it was a lie, an’ if Puss said I kicked dust on the white folks she was a DAMNED LYIN’ DEVIL.”[sic] He believed her and whipped Puss for lying to him. She commented that she never cursed because she is a good Methodist woman, but she did that day to save herself another whipping.  She talks throughout the interview about her masters whipping her for things she did wrong and things she did not deserve to be whipped for. She even says at one point that her mama’s master, “…whipped his slaves for pastime.”","As described in <em>Roll Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made</em>, slaves were sometimes killed due to excessive whipping. Whipping was a way to break or correct slaves, but abolitionists described this action as inhumane. Slaveholders believed that whippings were better than capital punishment. Their defense was that, “civilized countries like Germany permitted young mine workers-mere boys- to be whipped.” They did not believe that whipping was a crime, and that if it was a crime, it was only minor one.","To find this information about Sarah Frances Shaw Graves and other former slaves, the Works Progress Administration (WPA), conducted interviews with former slaves. The interview was done in person at her home in Skidmore, Missouri. The WPA conducted their series, Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers’ Project.

By the 70's it seemed to a significant amount of Americans, that what the government wanted to portray and what they were realistically taking care of were two very different truths. What the U.S. wanted American society to consist of were upper middle class or rich white individuals (preferably male) with conservative, Judeo-Christian beliefs. That these people would pray and worship a God that often times were one and the same as the American government. The ideology of the American mentality included not just a warped view of a uniquely American religious stance, but a stance where all Americans should be the same and think the alike. Where there was no poverty, no back talking or disagreeing with the government and everybody was heterosexual with one wife and their 2.5 children living in suburbia. And if in fact, “those” types of people did exist Americans should do everything in their power to either push them aside or make them disappear completely. The American government did not want or feel that they needed blacks with opinions let alone a black woman making her way through Congress. America only saw the “sin” in the power that the gay community and its leaders held in California. And when America was tired of minorities of all kinds, it was looking towards a vibrant, educated white youth to carry the torch, what they got instead were empowered white kids enraged by a government unwilling to pull out of Vietnam. While America was working hard towards a “Me” generation where the majority's problems did not matter and a fantasy of “what ifs” was put in its place, there were several, gutsy individuals and groups desperately trying to break that mold.","In 1972, Shirley Chisholm, the ultimate physical symbol fighting against the ideals of a “Me” generation, became the first African-American woman running as part of a major-party candidacy for the Democratic ticket and nomination of President of the United States. In the 1970's, America was overflowing with an ignorance towards racial divides although physical, up close and sometimes violent proof stated the opposite that things in fact were not alright. Her running came during a time where racial tension was high and what was considered an equal and fair opportunity for all held different feelings and definitions for both blacks and whites. The backdrop of her run was politically marked by examples of attempted equality like the Voting Rights Act which created an effort to integrate race relations in the South and outlaw voting discrimination against African-Americans and the Civil Rights Act which outlawed major discrimination against minorities. But what the United States wanted to project and achieve was not the social reality of what seemed to be a very bleak existence of blacks dealing with unemployment rates three times higher than whites and black anger increasing with the establishment of black militant organizations such as the Black Panther Party. Her very physical being, went against what made the American government and a dominating white society comfortable. She was a woman and she was black, to put both of those “concepts” together was a whole complex and intense conundrum for the American people to deal with. On the one hand she explains how entering into Congress for the first time, the white Congressmen had never had a black woman enter into their political platform and she was automatically shunned. On the other, even among black groups and the black community she was shun due to black men being intimidated and threatened by the fact that she was a woman. To bring that together and give her an intelligent mind and voice to state what was wrong with American society and give her a national platform on which to speak, broke the mold of a society with a “it's all about me” mentality to realize there was great unjust among blacks and sometimes equal discrimination against women. So what she needed black Americans to do, especially black women, in such a time of confusion and hardships was to go against the grain as she had done and use their power to fight not physically or violently but to use what many whites dreaded...their vote. She brought to the forefront what was not being said in Congress, that over 50% of the nation's budget (her estimate was 75%) was being used on a foreign, immoral war yet the true war raged on domestically with a nation divided amongst itself.","Unlike Shirley Chisholm, who was a more obvious example for minority groups that made white people uncomfortable, was the less obvious Harvey Milk. At first glance he is who the American government and society wanted to continue to uplift. He was a financially comfortable, white male, a veteran from the U.S. navy, running his own business in a middle class neighborhood. However his ideals and sexuality both directly and indirectly did not line up with what society was supposed to be like. Harvey Milk was a gay man which in and of itself went against the traditional Judeo-Christian idealism of America. To make matters worse, he was also the first openly gay politician in San Francisco which also went against what American society. What society wanted and expected was if a person was indeed gay, he or she should keep it themselves because to be gay in the 1970's was taboo and illegal. In the backdrop of the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York which set off the modern, openly gay liberation movement, Harvey Milk would become a main leader in San Francisco's newly gay political community. But America did not want to deal with gay people they in fact wanted to get rid of them with political bills such as Proposition 6, which was a state wide gesture that allowed the firing of any teacher in public schools who was gay and any other public school faculty that was pro-gay. Milk fought against such openly discriminative political documents but wanted to make it clear that while he fought for gays, lesbians and transgendered/transsexual peoples, his political fight was for all peoples who were considered minorities and were underrepresented in San Francisco. He said what so many Americans at the time were afraid to speak of which was the realization that gays walked among them and no, they did not have signs written on their foreheads to let others know of their whereabouts, so the American people needed to learn to have respect and tolerance for all no matter who they came across. Milk's perfect example of the political and religious agenda set against gay Americans came in an interview where he said that he understood who he was up against but that the “white, wealthy, non-gay establishment would have to deal with him; that is truly an incredible and powerful position to be in.” Harvey Milk and his political position would not allow an ignorant mentality to continue to place its hold over the minds of the American people but wanted instead to change what Americans felt so uncomfortable with concerning gays in the first place. Although he was assassinated in 1978 by another San Francisco city supervisor, Dan White, his ideals would leave a permanent mark in California, especially in the San Francisco area. This mark would go on to change the political ideals, when a decade after Milk's assassination, a poll would show that San Francisco's gay community felt that they had a “moderate amount” or “a lot” of influence over local government compared to only 48% of the straight respondents who believed the same sentiment. And only two years prior to that poll, a gay San Francisco columnist wrote, “Politicians can be destroyed by the gay vote. As long as we keep our vote, they're going to kiss our ass for a long time.”","Probably the most confusing to the American government and public was the formation of the Weather Underground also known as the Weathermen. They were a part of the anti-draft and anti-war movement of the late 60's to mid 70's with extremist views that believed in “bringing the war home” by bombing banks and government buildings. Their ultimate goal was to overtake and overthrow the U.S. government due to their refusal to pull out of the Vietnam War and their abuse towards blacks. What made them so confusing to the American public was because of what they stood for due to who they were. They were not black like Shirley Chisholm nor were they gay (for the most part, not including their sexual experimentation with the same sex during orgies) like Harvey Milk, trying to organize a type of LGBT rights organization. These were mainly upper middle class college students with rich parents (some of those parents were even local politicians) who basically had the world at their feet and if they wanted to live a comfortable lifestyle, they could very well do so. There only real issue was being drafted into the Vietnam War but even if that happened with the connections and the money there parents had they were more than likely to gain “cushy” jobs that did not require front line action. Unlike their poorer, black, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts who constituted more than 80% of American ground troops. So what was there problem? They had everything they wanted and they were everything that the U.S. wanted to portray their young people as. The U.S. did not want to deal with underprivileged, ethnic youths, but who they wanted ended up being the kind of people that constituted the Weathermen. As President Nixon continued to ignore the peoples cry that the conflict in Vietnam was immoral and unjust, the Weathermen, once a non-violent group who took after the teachings of peaceful demonstrations from Martin Luther King Jr. were now taking after the Black Panther Party, sharing in their anger and setting up recruitment just like them and even supporting them by endorsing them to the mass public. Their point was not to do the complete opposite of what was expected of these young white kids just for the sake of rebelling but because this white ideology was destroying the nation. They were going to side with the black community and they refused to allow their privileges as whites to add to the problem in America anymore. It was hard for Americans to understand the terrorist actions of other Americans bombing their own buildings but the message behind these attacks were not just for the sake of blowing up a building it was to get people in the U.S. to realize that this was not just a foreign war that did not effect them unless they were drafted, but that if they refused to stop the war then indeed it did effect them because they were part of the problem. And the problem was very much real no matter how much Americans wanted to ignore it with companies such as Dow Chemical, for example, using technological and chemical warfare like napalm, used to kill innocent and impoverished Vietnamese. Or the U.S. government breaking and entering into one of the leaders of the Black Panthers home, Fred Hampton, and assassinating him in his bed while he slept. These were kids who were angry with what their white government was doing both to its own people and internationally; kids who were willing to recruit white youth to join in, taking down what many would say as their “own” people (other whites). The Weathermen were trying to put the issue of what was going on in the faces of Americans first by peaceful marches and when the problem only escalated domestically and internationally, they felt they had no choice but to show them a tiny part of the violence occurring in Vietnam by turning to domestic terrorism. The acts they committed were only a physical embodiment of their ideals which as one of the faces of the Weathermen, Bernardine Dohrn stated, “I believe that there will come a day when white people will have to make uncomfortable decisions and learn to side with the Vietnamese and Black people.”","The United States in the 1970's has been argued to be a “Me” generation and while it did strive hard to get there and in many ways and areas of the country it was, there was a much stronger argument for all of the things that went wrong. As the nation continued on a one noted idea of what it wanted to be and portray to what they believed to be a corrupt world, the American people were becoming excessively bothered by a communism induced paranoia the country held. Since that was its main focus everything and everyone else fell by the wayside. What the people needed was stronger leadership and a sense of an empathetic community so that all might understand each other and gain an equal political foothold. So people with a voice, whether they had extreme views like the Weathermen or more subdued ways to fight like Shirley Chisholm and Harvey Milk rose to power not because they were trying to divide or disrupt the country as many thought (including the government) but to stop the advancement of a country that had let its people down and were allowing them to believe, on top of all the problems they had, that they were a perfect society at the center of a very inferior world."," "],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":546,"tag":"Homosexuality"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1556,"tag":"Anti War"},{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1557,"tag":"Terrorism"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5607,"title":"Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute Flyer","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-09-15","end_date":"1892-09-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<strong> In 1892 the administrative staff at Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (what is today Virginia State University) created a flyer for the prospective students giving them general information about the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute's entrance requirements, educational programs, and cost.

They boy who had been taken from him years earlier was up for sale, and it looked as though Bayley would lose his once in a lifetime opportunity to buy his son back. This is the story of Solomon Bayley, born into slavery decades before the onset of the Civil War and an ideal example of the commodofication and dehumanization of the enslaved population discussed in Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul. </em>A deeply religious man who later became a Methodist minister, Bayley fought to obtain not only his own freedom, but also that of his wife, son, and two daughters. Following a number of miraculous escapes and his ability to hide himself from right under the nose of pursuing slave traders, Bayley was able to make his way home to Delaware and ultimately become a free man. It was when Bayley went to the courts, then later purchased his wife and son that the true atrocities of commodofication and dehumanization can be clearly seen.","After being taken out of his home state of Delaware, Bayley went to the courts to legally gain his freedom, as was said to be granted to him according to state laws, but as his final trials neared, the first instances of dehumanization began. Although slaves who left the boarders of Delaware were promised their freedom, Bayley acted as a prime example of the ways in which the enslaved were not treated as human beings, but as objects and property. Bayley was not human, but as Johnson writes “a measurable monetary value” (25), and this was clearly demonstrated when Bayley went to court to legally fight for his freedom. Before his final trials were set to take place, Bayley explained that he was \"taken up and put on board of a vessel...bound to Richmond\" (2), losing his chance at freedom and the opportunity to become human again.","The most blatant example of commodofication can be seen when Bayley, after having purchased his own freedom from his master, bargained for the release of his wife and then purchases his son at a slave auction. To Bayley, his wife and son were some of the most important people in his life, but unlike the views of white slaveholders, their value went far beyond a price or numerical value. Johnson explains that in the slave market, slaves were trained and transformed into marketable objects, and their humanity was of no value to slaveholders who looked to buy and sell slaves at competitive rates. Bayley not only had to give his wife’s master all the money he owned for her freedom, but also had to work for him for a time to pay off the rest of the sum. He did not buy her off the auction block, but he needed to pay a steep fine to free his wife and take her home, even though she was Bayley’s husband, her master would only let her go at a price. Johnson argues that slavery, particularly the slave market, “was everywhere in the antebellum South” and acted as the foundation of “all of the values associated with the antebellum South” (116), that slaves were valued only as labor and a way of maintaining the economy and social standards of southern society.","Bayley’s purchase of his son also demonstrates the role of commodofication in slave society. Straight out of a slave market, Bayley was barely able to buy his son, but with the money he had and the contributions of some kind friends, he bought his son out of a life of captivity. Bayley’s son came from exactly the situation that Johnson describes in <em>Soul By Soul</em>, and Bayley learned that his son's master had died, and \"his property had to be sold, and my son had to be sold, as the other property, at public sale\" (29); the sale of his son is a direct example of one of slavery’s most evil institutions, the slave market. This boy was Bayley’s own flesh and blood, but because of the slave trade, as Johnson discusses, families were broken up constantly and white slaveholders took the place of African American parents in deciding the fate of their children.

To add insult to injury, his father had stolen their master's horses and had them attached to the cart that would carry the family to safety. When the master, Rev. Thompson of Canaan Township, arose the next morning, he would discover both his slaves and horses missing while James Mars and his family were rolling into the neighboring community of Norfolk, in the foothills of the Berkshire mountains in the remote northwest corner of Connecticut. The consequences of this defiant, daring escape would be tense and unsettling for the escapees, as they would be relentlessly hunted by Thompson and his posse. In pursuit of freedom, they were running for their lives.","James Mars's slave narrative is absorbing, and he tells it thoughtfully and with careful consideration of details to place the reader in sufficient context. From what the reader can gather, Mars's master, Rev. Thompson, owned property in Virginia as well, and his wife -- who was from there -- coupled with tensions between the North and the South influenced him to move down to his southern estate. However, when he broke the news of the move to his slaves, Mars's father outright refused to be taken South and plotted a daring escape to save his family from inevitable disaster. Mars bestowed great credit to his father for having had the foresight and courage to attempt such a risky endeavor. As Mars explains in the narrative, \"My father, although a slave without education, was intensely watching the movements of the teacher of the people [Thompson], but kept all that he saw to himself, yet he was steadily planning his escape.\" Removing his family to nearby Norfolk, Mars's father sought shelter from a number of sympathetic white families. They hoped that if they held out long enough in Norfolk, their master would just cut his losses and depart permanently for Virginia; however, Reverend Thompson proved relentless in his determination to recover his slaves, and ultimately he discovered the whereabouts of his slaves and negotiated with them to ensure that he at least recovered the monetary worth of the family's two boys, Mars and his brother. The accord the two sides arrived at saw Mars and his brother being sold to separate masters -- with the slave family, surprisingly, awarded some say in determining who their boys would work for -- while Mars's father, mother, and sister were freed. This order of business settled, cruel Thompson finally departed for Virginia. The whole experience lasted, it can be inferred, a matter of months.","Mars's narrative is an unusual one in the grand collection of slave narratives, not only because of the northern location but also because Mars and his family were allowed such generous space in interacting with their legal owners. Historian Walter Johnson, in his landmark monograph <em>Soul by Soul</em>, explores how, in the slave markets of southern cities such as New Orleans, the commodities being offered -- a.k.a., the slaves themselves -- exercised some agency in the transactions in that they could, through facial expressions or posture or other means of passive communication, influence who purchased them. However, compared to this minimal control in determining their own fates as articulated by Johnson, James Mars and his family were able to obtain substantial leverage in negotiating with their master. For example, the exasperated Reverend Thompson agreed, per his slaves' wishes, to free Mars's parents and sister and relinquished control of the two boys to other slave masters whom Mars's family had had a say in selecting for their sons. And, while Mars was serving as a slave to his designated master, Mr. Munger, he demonstrated surprising boldness in dealing with Munger, repeatedly butting heads with his owner over when and under what conditions he was to be freed. Ultimately, Mars negotiated a satisfactory termination of his own involuntary servitude under Munger and on warm terms with the family to which he served, as he asserted he felt he had become a member of the family and remained in touch with them throughout his adulthood. In stark contrast to Walter Johnson's argument that reveals the meager means of agency that Africans in southern slave markets derived from the daily transactions, Mars and his family, albeit living in the North but nonetheless in a largely inhospitable climate and at an earlier time than the era depicted in Johnson's monograph, were able to exert some significant leverage against their owner and therefore paved the path for future abolitionist endeavors.","Beyond mere agency of the slaves, Mars's narrative indicates also, in agreement with Walter Johnson's definition of the \"chattel principle\" in <em>Soul by Soul</em>, that slave owners had a foremost concern for cash and that that thirst for wealth far outweighed any paternalistic obligations toward their slaves that slaveowners sensed. Mars was especially disturbed, it seems, by how his former master Rev. Thompson, the esteemed and morally impervious pastor of his parish, could not only practice the inhumane institution of slavery but also, in good conscience, be willing to either condemn his slaves to a life of misery on a southern plantation or sell them to another man for hard cash. Mars's depiction of Thompson directly relates to Walter Johnson's explanation of how slave masters, though some purported to have a paternalistic, charitable attitude toward their slaves, were in fact and invariably more concerned with increasing their wealth and would not hesitate in selling loyal slaves and separating families in exchange for cash. The slaves, perceived as chattel property and mere commodity, were expendable, and thus the inhumanity of slavery was only metastasized."," "],"display_date":"1798 - 1815","search_date":"1807-01-01","locations":[{"id":15295,"lat":41.7868855542,"lng":-73.2333892529,"zoom":7,"place":"Litchfield, Connecticut"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5656,"title":"Refuge in Religion: The Story of the Baptist Minister Noah Davis","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Noah Davis sat puzzled, he contemplated his next move. He had already purchased six of his children back from various slave owners, through hard work and many favors gained from people he discovered on his travels. His life defined turmoil. Noah Davis worked against the clock to purchase his seventh and final child, his daughter who was born into bondage. Noah Davis was already well versed in the North, as he had traveled often in search of funds to help pay for the church he planned on starting in Baltimore. He arrived into Boston where he was able to leave with 400 dollars toward his daughter's freedom. On those Boston streets, Davis stood star struck as he noticed his old master. He remembered what his master once said to him, \"I am not afraid of you running away Noah,-- you may go where you please.\" This was the same man, who made Noah's freedom possible, the same man who granted Noah Davis a free pass to the North to collect the money to buy his own freedom.","Noah's fortunes shifted greatly, and he thanked God. He then traveled to Providence, where he had worked hard to collect the money to purchase his daughter's freedom. Noah Davis was invited to preach, and give sermons at local Baptist churches throughout Providence. On his final day, through these church meetings, the most significant moment in Noah Davis' quest for his daughter's freedom occured. While Noah prepared for his trip to New York, a man of great authority approached Noah with a propisition. In front of the entire meeting, the man proclaimed \"Brother Davis, give yourself no more trouble about that daughter,-- You say you have to stop in New York. Let me say say, that when you get home, whatever you lack of the four hundred dollars, write to me, and I will send you a check for the balance.\" Noah proclaimed this as an act of God, and to his relief, promulgated \"I now left Providence, feeling in my heart that the place is rightly called by that name, as far as I am concerned.\"","In truth, Noah Davis was blessed to have the mild-mannered master in Fredericksburg, as he was allowed space to develop as an individual. However, as discussed in Walter Johnson's book <em>Soul by Soul, </em>were the concepts of turning people into commodities and the creation of a law of supply and demand for slaves. The harsh reality is that Noah Davis not only had to buy himself out of freedom, but also his seven children who were born into bondage as well. Through his focus on faith, and the connections he was able to make during his time traveling and in Baltimore, he was able to possess the strength to purchase his family. It is one of the many horrors of the slave market, and slavery in general, this idea that a family can be broken apart, and then sold individually in correlation with a notional concept of a human stock market. Even though Noah Davis freed his children from bondage, this reality is merely a fantasy for the majority of slaves who were taken from their kin and sold in the \"Deep South\".","This quote in Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em> displays the rarity of the circumstances in which had unfolded for Noah Davis, \"... some few others were able to gain their freedom by purchasing themselves.\" Noah Davis lived a life in which he was able to escape the normal. He put his faith into God, his fellow man, and with help from a kind slave master, he successfully avoided the \"story of seperated lovers and broken families.\""," "],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":5931,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"},{"id":13838,"lat":39.2038567799,"lng":-78.2606208397,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Virginia"},{"id":11401,"lat":41.8745874433,"lng":-71.5917581694,"zoom":10,"place":"PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5643,"title":"Something from Nothing: How Kate Drumgoold Directed Her Own Future","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-01","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Kate Drumgoold walked through the door of the school room, the fee for her education in one hand and a Bible in the other.

Saving up her earnings to pay for her schooling had been difficult, but her dream of one day being able to teach fellow former slaves to read and write so that they could become better Christians helped her bide her time to ensure that day could come."," ","Slavery in the United States could not be boiled down to a universal experience. The varying degrees of cruelty exhibited by owners created a spectrum of suffering on which the lives of slaves fell. Kate Drumgoold had the good fortune of growing up in the years just before the Civil War broke out in the home of an exceptionally caring owner. She was one of thirteen children, but she was frequently separated from her mother and siblings and the family underwent long periods of time without contact. Drumgoold had no choice in being parted from her family during her younger years, but she would not allow this powerlessness to define her life later down the line. Attending church was an integral part of Drumgoold’s relationship with her ‘white mother,’ as she referred to the wife of her owner, and the education she received there endowed her with a sense of personal empowerment. Upon reaching adulthood, though Drumgoold was technically free, she still depended on the employment of the same families who would have owned her just years earlier. Despite this, Drumgoold disregarded official assignments concerning the location of her work, choosing instead to remain loyal to the families she liked better, the women she felt needed her, and ultimately, herself. She asserted power in a situtation where she seemed to have none."," ","It is true that Drumgoold was already a free woman when she shaped her circumstances, but that does not mean her ancestors were unable to create a sense of agency for themselves. Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em> delves into the mindset and behaviors of all parties involved in the New Orleans slave market—traders, owners, and the slaves themselves. Johnson informs the reader of the ability the slaves in pens had to potentially influence their sales through networks of communication, personal observations, and mastering the art of answering questions. The availability of this opportunity varied and some individuals were more adept at taking advantage of it than others, but what is important is that it did in fact exist."," ","Kate Drumgoold lived in Virginia in a domestic setting, not in New Orleans as a field hand, and she was never put up for auction, but she and the individuals discussed by Johnson exhibited similar skills in manipulation for personal benefit. Those who remained enslaved were only able to control their lives so much, but Drumgoold used the freedom afforded her by time to pay it forward, working to put herself through school so that she in turn could educate other former slaves, continuing the tradition of self-improvement against the odds."," "],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":13742,"lat":37.3864763379,"lng":-77.5769179581,"zoom":9,"place":"CHESTERFIELD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5646,"title":"The Power of the Bible","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","Walking all alone through the dirt roads of Vermont on a bitterly cold winter day, Aaron found himself astonished. Aaron's astonishment had nothing to do with the journey itself; it was far removed from the runaway slave advertisements he had grown accustomed to seeing on the sidewalks of Ohio claiming his name, from the days in which he had to hide whenever there were newcomers in town, from the unforgiving days, the hunger, and the refusal of many white families to let him sleep in their homes. Instead, he was astonished by the supremacy of God: “ … I had froze all my toes and feet; with good shoes and stockings on too… And when I come to realize what the Lord has brought me through, I am really astonished; he has kept my unworthy body from freezing to death, and from starving to death” (Aaron 1849; 18). This becomes a very important moment in Aaron’s life:  the \"poor way-faring Bondman\" had found justice finally--- a true revelation--- in the bible.","Horace Greeley once said, “It is impossible to enslave, mentally or socially, a bible-reading people. The principles of the bible are the groundwork of human freedom.” <em>The Light and Truth of Slavery</em> by Aaron is a commentary that reflects this humanistic idea of the slave having control over his or her future. In the book, Aaron cannot read or write a word, but knows the bible quite well. In fact, after escaping the South, Aaron starts lecturing in churches throughout the North. Aaron touches on issues like slavery, religion, and politics. This book is not your traditional narrative, because very little is known about the narrator’s past. We know that he was born a slave in the South. We also know that the death of his parents precipitated his decision to escape.","One of the biggest themes in Aaron’s book is the slave experience. According to Aaron, slaves often face the difficult decision of running away from their masters and risking their lives. Slaves ran the risk of being caught and placed on the whipping post. On top of that, many slaves often had no food and very little clothing. In the book, Aaron describes his terrible experience during a bitterly cold winter. He says, “When I struck into the Vermont State, for one week I could scarce step a step, cause I had froze all my toes and feet; with good shoes and stockings on too. Little after that time I could pull all my toe nails out like rotten meat…” (Aaron 1849: 18). Slaves like Aaron firmly believed that that if slaves had the option of staying in the South, they would choose to stay without a doubt.","The slave experience is also portrayed in Walter Johnson’s book, <em>Soul by Soul. </em>In the book, he describes the environment of the slave market, which expanded dramatically in cities like New Orleans. African Americans faced the issue of new ownership. As a result, many of them refused to be traded. The book says, “…the slaves had come to know and trust one another, and in the market they could share their observations of the slaveholder and collectively resist them” (Johnson 1967: 16). Others decided to escape rather than accepting a possible trade. Agency was a big issue in the slave market. Slaves were not allowed to have a say when deciding on terms of the contract. Similarly, Aaron's book deals with the difficult decision of escaping slavery and risking their lives. Aaron had seen his parents die from exploitation, and he did not wanted to die like that. He escaped to the North, where he was able to sin his booktart a new life.","In his book, Aaron also talks about a big contraction. He says that most white people say that they are good Christians, and yet they are slaveholders. Aaron thinks that this is hypocrisy. According to him, slavery is a sin and the bible condemns it. Only the worst of the worst could allow such a monstrosity to occur; he states that there are close to three million slaves during the time. Good Christianity, according to Aaron, is loving one another no matter the color or race. He says that preachers in the North are the most evil; they preach one thing in the North and then go back to the South, and become slaveholders. In addition, Aaron hates it when white people say that slaves should be happy where they are, because they are worst off in Africa where “kings” make hundreds of sacrifices.","In short, <em>The Light and Truth of Slavery </em>talks aboutissues that are deeper than slavery. The commentary depicts the journey of a “way-faring bondman” looking for answers. In the book, Aaron travels around the North lecturing people, and asking important questions that everyone should ask, such as why is there slavery in the land of the free? Aaron believes that the answer lies in politics and in the church."],"display_date":1849,"search_date":"1849-07-02","locations":[{"id":6217,"lat":42.3513145465,"lng":-71.9048338794,"zoom":8,"place":"WORCESTER, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":92,"tag":"Freed Slaves"},{"id":165,"tag":"Church"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5647,"title":"The Power of the Slave Market","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-01","end_date":"1869-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Cyrus Branch's father, Neptune, was used to getting lied to.

Upon his owner's death Neptune found himself in the hands of a new master who approached Neptune with an enticing offer; purchase your own freedom. When he finally accumulated the means to do so, his owner graciously accepted the money, but whether out of cruelty or neglect, he fails to file the important legal paperwork required to make such a purchase legitimate. A despondent Neptune was forced to pay again. These instances in Cyrus Branch's narrative enlighten the reader to slavery as a market in the south that depended on rules and regulations, just as any property, and how Southern whites viewed social hierarchy.","The primary focus of Johnson's Soul by Soul is the reality of slavery being the buying and selling of a \"good\". A commodity essential to the function of the South. Often times, slavery as a market is rarely discussed, and Johnson enlightens the reader on the economic reality of the slave market, specifically in Louisiana. In turn, the narrative of Cyrus Branch (John White) is heavily dependent on the buying and selling of slaves. It is very clear, in both these works, that slavery was a financial staple in the Southern way of life. Soul by Soul is very clear of the importance of record keeping in terms of slavery in that era. Like all property, slave deals were expected to be official in formation and documentation, and it is easy to see how Neptune was so easily cheated. In Cyrus' own life, he was sold four times until he was finally able to escape to the North. These are prime examples of Johnson’s discussion of just how deep the market of slavery went in the lives and financial reality of Southerners before the Civil War, it wasn't just a cruel hobby as so often portrayed, rather, slavery was central to the function of the South as a market."],"display_date":1869,"search_date":"1869-07-02","locations":[{"id":13741,"lat":37.3864763379,"lng":-77.5769179581,"zoom":9,"place":"CHESTERFIELD, Virginia"},{"id":13472,"lat":43.0354607933,"lng":-73.0929521517,"zoom":9,"place":"BENNINGTON, Vermont"}],"tags":[{"id":126,"tag":"fugitive slave"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5649,"title":"\"Whiteness\", Power and Control","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["William Wells Brown was owned by Dr. Young, but was hired out to work for different masters throughout his slavery.

He could not make his escape, being heavily outnumbered and carrying the substantial type, so William fought back. He was able to make his retreat, but the sons of slave-holders took the type. William informed Mr. Lovejoy about the incident, and Lovejoy was able to return with the type. However, he did inform William that Samuel McKinney said he would whip him because he had hurt his son. McKinney was true to his word, finding William on the street and striking him over the head five or six times with a large cane. It took William five weeks to be able to walk again.","In Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em>, it is the idea of “whiteness”, the principle of being a true white Southern male, it was necessary to be able to keep slaves in their place. It was the idea of proving how white someone was by how they treated blacks, by either being a slave-holder, becoming a slave-holder or seeking vengeance on a black, treating them as less than human. That was the kind of act McKinney was displaying. The purpose behind finding William again, with the express intention of hurting him, was because William had attacked his son. That was how McKinney perceived the event.","For McKinney the beating was about protecting his white, slave-holding honor. A slave had stepped out of place by hurting his son. It was not important that his son had started the confrontation; it was about how William defended himself. His actions were about protecting the southern hierarchy, the hierarchy on which everything depends. An idea put forth by Saidiya V. Hartman in <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>, the exercise of power by the slave-holders upon the slaves was as important as having a legal title to the slave property. For all slave-holders, it was essential to keep control over the enslaved population because the entire economy was based on that hold. Slaves provided the labor that kept the plantations in business, negating the cost of labor. The planters were able to then invest the funds saved back into the plantation for more land and more slaves. For Southerners, slaves were important for their economic value, and created a cycle where Southerners felt they could not function without slaves. That cycle needed to be protected with violence as a way to maintain control over the labor force.","In William Wells Brown’s life this was one of the few instances where he was personally subjected to the cruelty of the Southern white male. He was personally targeted with the purpose of causing him lasting, physical pain because of his actions, required actions, against a white slave-holding son.

Some did so through beatings, starvation, and atrocious treatment. Others did through simple words, such as order a slave to perform a task that the owner knew the slave particularly despised. Regardless of how, each slave's day was full of a constant reminder that they were nothing more than owned manual labor; without an immense stroke of luck, that was all they would ever be.","In Charleston, South Carolina, William Green was reminded of this fact every single day. From the earliest point of his life he was robbed of the good luck that would've made him a free man. He missed being freed by the will of his old mistress because he was born three months before she died; he was no longer to be freed when he was twenty-five because his new master traded him without mentioning that fact to his new owner, and so he became a slave for life.","Eventually, the humiliation and degredation became too much for him to take. Green was acutely aware that the only fact that he was not beaten by his new master was because he was the favorite slave of his master's wife. So instead of being whipped and degraded directly by his master, Green was sent to fetch a box from the jail. Now for Green, that was the last thing he could take. His master had ordered him to go fetch a package from the jail, which on the surface seems mundane. In actuality, as Green very well knew, his master was sending him to the jail to be whipped by the man who ran the jailhouse. So instead of willingly walk to his own beating and potential death, Green decided to flee to Massachusetts. After many months of struggling, he arrive in Springfield, where he lived the rest of his life as a free man.","As Hartman discusses in Scenes of Subjugation, \"a slave must be subject to the master's will in all things,\" and Green wasn't. Whether it was because of the protection from his master's wife, or his acute sense of the injustice he was forced to be subjected to, Green was not an obedient slave. And because of that, his master saw himself as forced to send Green to be whipped at the jail, in an attempt to teach him respect and discipline. And while the master himself couldn't subjugate Green, because Green was still a piece of property, he could still order Green to go somewhere where he could be subjugated. Unfortunately for Green's owner, that line of thinking ended up backfiring.","Becuase of his early life and being robbed of his freedom by being traded, William Green was constantly painfully aware that his life and liberty had been injustly taken from him. This was a constant theme throughout his narrative, and the passion with which he writes about his early years in Charleston clearly show how much hatred he had trapped inside of him during that time.

One day, a strange man and slave woman entered the central House. The man offered William a piece of candy and then took him without warning. He was taken to Atlanta, Georgia. He was four years old.","He had been purchased by a widow who ran a slave farm, a place where slaves of good backgrounds were taught skills to increase their market value. He was used mostly to run errands, and was whipped by his master if he did not return in what was an undisclosed acceptable amount of time. He remained there for three years, until he ran away after his mistress went to fetch the twigs and branches she used to discipline her property. He hitchhiked back to Newbern, hoping stage coach then walking back to his plantation only to find his mother and live in a potato cellar for three more years. He was found again, betrayed by his hunger. He would be sold two more times before he was freed.","It’s incredible how a man once beaten for opening a book, could live such an extraordinary life.  He met Abraham Lincoln at the headquarters of General Ambrose Burnside.  He would found an all African American Regiment of the Union Army, the 35<sup>th</sup> US Colored Infantry, serving with distinction and honorably discharged following the Union victory.

Meharry is particularly important institution because it was the first medical school in the South for African Americans. The school is still operating successfully today even though it has faced many hardships. Without this school African Americans would have had very little chance becoming physicians but more importantly many would not have had access to medical care.","In 1904 the first of a series of events began that would put the schools ability to remain open in jeopardy; the AMA formed a council to overhaul medical education in America. This committee adopted two standards to medical education. The first being that applicants to medical school have to have at least two years of college with studies mostly devoted to the sciences. The second standard stated that medical school will consist of two years of anatomy and physiology and two years of clinical work at a teaching hospital.  The committee then appointed Abraham Flexner to do a survey of the country’s medical schools and to promote their agenda (Flexner).","This reform affected African American medical schools much differently than they did white medical colleges. After the Flexner report most of the white medical colleges quickly accepted the plan while none of the African American colleges did. The reason for not accepting these standards was because the African American medical schools would not be able to cover the costs of operation while still following the new standards. White schools were able to adhere to these standards because they had endowments and large donors. Black schools had very little money coming in from donors and small or no endowments. Schools like Meharry would not be able to fill all of their classroom seats because they would not be able to find enough African Americans that qualified for admission. This lack of qualified students was because most African American colleges don’t even offer the upper level science courses that the AMA recommended. The AMA’s new standards made it nearly impossible for Meharry and schools like it to stay open (Savitt).","The AMA instituted a grading system to report which schools were satisfactory in their eyes and which ones deserve to be shut down. Students graduating from schools below a certain grade would find it very difficult to attain a medical license thus negating their years of training. All of the African American schools graded very poorly and by 1923 only two African American schools remain. Meharry was one of those schools partially thanks to a donation from the Carnegie Foundation. Meharry would continue to struggle to survive for years to come (Savitt).","The goal of the AMA was to improve medical education in America. It may have achieved that but it also set back African Americans several decades in the field of medicine. Without the courage of Meharry the affect of these new regulations would have been far worse for African Americans."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1910 - January 1, 1923","search_date":"1916-07-02","locations":[{"id":16613,"lat":36.169373125,"lng":-86.7847981408,"zoom":9,"place":"Davidson, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1660,"tag":"Flexner"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5959,"title":"The 606 Horse Shoe Bar in Black Bottom","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"1/1/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Several buildings align St. Antoine Street, a well-known street in Paradise Valley. The buildings on this street all look similarly plain and hastily built, which speaks to the poverty present in the area. Cars frequent this area to experience the entertainment life, which is in part shaped by the 606 Horse Shoe Bar and Lounge. The 606 Horse Shoe Bar and Lounge, a popular spot in Paradise Valley, stands in the daylight with a few patrons congregating at its front. A sign attached to the front of the building informs those in the community about future musical talent. Located at 606 St. Antoine Street, this bar and lounge is accustomed to hosting people to and from, as it is utilized as a space for Blacks to have entertainment away from whites. Some nights, Duke Ellington would play for whites at a venue too expensive for Blacks to attend, and use the Horse Shoe Bar as his after party. Even though the Black residents of Detroit were largely confined to Black Bottom due to segregation, the oppression endured by these Blacks did not stop the creation of this “Paradise Valley.” The Horse Shoe Bar contributes to this development of a vibrant strip of businesses for residents of Black Bottom. Little does this bar and its patrons know, the brown building that contains the prized “The 606 Horse Shoe Bar and Lounge” will soon be turned into rubble: a new plan of Detroit will arrive. With this new plan, the city and federal government will utilize eminent domain to build a freeway through this destination. Policymakers will say that entertainment at this bar and lounge will be no more.","The tragedy that later came to The 606 Horse Shoe Bar and Lounge was not unique. Despite the fact that Blacks were confined to the Black Bottom residential district and the Paradise Valley entertainment district to stay away from whites in the 1940s, city leaders again justified uprooting Blacks from the area of the bar in the late 1960s in the name of the “public good.” Plenty of businesses and homes were destroyed in this community, along with the Horse Shoe Bar, to make room for the I-75 Freeway. The surrounding community, established in Black Bottom/Paradise Valley to make the best out of subpar housing conditions and contained siting, was deliberately torn apart. The residents of Black Bottom had to find a new home, without the help of city government.

Over these five years, the landscape of Black Bottom changed drastically. In 1956, the image of Black Bottom shows how it was designed in an organized way: the roads run parallel to one another, there is a clear divide between residential and commercial districts (which also speaks to intentional zoning in Detroit), and homes were built to be similar in size. The organized layout of Black Bottom in 1956 speaks to the homogenous way that Detroit wanted the neighborhoods in this predominately Black community to look. The snapshot of Black Bottom in 1961 shows that areas once filled with homes in 1956 became desolate shells of their former selves. The makings of a freeway are clear through the center of this once-lively community. Only a portion of this area of Detroit is demolished: the area that contained the majority of blacks. The siting of the freeway was intentional.","The creation of Interstate-75 through Black Bottom completely dismantled and uprooted the residents of the community that once called Black Bottom home. The removal of residents from Black Bottom forcibly sent its residents elsewhere in Detroit, without any governmental assistance. Interstate-75 was created in support of urban renewal, which sought to remove poor neighborhoods such as that of Black Bottom.

The nearby Paradise Valley commercial district provided residents with entertainment and a sustainable nightlife. The Brewster-Douglass Housing Project was the first federal housing project built for African-Americans. The siting of these projects was intentional, as it helped to ensure that African-Americans would remain in segregated neighborhoods, away from whites.

In passing the bill Alabama was following in the footsteps of Northern states that had already institutionalized eugenics, but while the North undertook eugenics to perfect society as a whole, the South was trying to perfect the white race only.","In contrast to Northern institutions for the Feeble-Minded, which admitted all, the Southern institutions were segregated. The Southern institutions processed fewer patients than the Northern ones and accepted only white children, believing that Feeble-Mindedness was, as historian Grergory Dorr puts it, “inherently a question for the Negro to solve for himself”. An example of this attitude can be found in Dr. Partlow approach to identify the Feeble-Minded. Partlow sends it colleague Dr. Thomas Haynes of Birmingham, AL, a representative of the National committee on Mental Hygiene, to complete survey of several institutions in the Birmingham area, both black and white which included The Industrial School in East Lake, The Girls’ Reform School in East Lake The Girls Industrial School in Woodlawn,The Reform School or Juvenile Negro Boys, and MT.

At the end of segregation, African Americans had become the targets of extra-institutional and extra-legal sterilizations, reflective of a more general southern racist view that it was necessary “to further protect the white race itself from black folks\"."," "],"display_date":"April 20, 1917","search_date":"1917-04-20","locations":[{"id":17729,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1669,"tag":"South"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":533,"tag":"Eugenics"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6072,"title":"<strong>Medical Advancements at the cost of Dignity</strong>","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-10","end_date":"1836-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a brisk morning in January of 1836, Dr. J. Marion Sims started his day with his routine house-to-house calls in Montgomery, Alabama. Dr. Sims was a well-established and distinguished practitioner of medicine who came to Alabama from South Carolina to establish his own medical practice; he was also best known for his accomplishments in Women’s health and for the establishment of the first Women’s Hospital in the state of Alabama. While on his routine house call, he was notified by a friend that Mrs. Merrill, who was the wife of a prominent farmer, was terribly ill. Upon his arrival, Dr. J. Marion Sims described the situation at hand. ““She was in bed, complaining of great pain in her back, and a sense of tenesmus in both the bladder and rectum, the bearing down making her condition miserable”. Dr. Sims had to act fast on the female patient. Dr. Sims remembered two things while this emergency took place. First he remembered how much he “hated investigating the organs of the female pelvis”, and he also remembered his professor Dr. Prioleau of the Charleston Medical College, who said, “Gentlemen, if any of you are ever called to a case of sudden version of the uterus backward, you must place the patient on the knees and elbows-in a genu-pectoral position- and then introduce one finger into the rectum and another into the vagina, and push up, and pull down”. After executing protocol, Dr. Sims knew ultimately he had to get the uterus in position by using this method prescribed above. Mrs. Merrill was screaming from the top of her lungs as Dr. Sims still hand deep in her vagina pushed his hand toward the lady’s uterus wall and turned his hand upward and downward pushing with all his might until he could no longer feel her uterus or her womb. Mrs. Merrill enduring all of this pain suddenly said “Why, doctor, I am relived.” Just then as Mrs. Merrill was about to lie down on her back, she let out an explosion. Mrs. Merrill was speechless and bashful, but Dr. Sims knew this escape of gas was not from the bowel, but from the vagina. Dr. Sims had a revelation. He thought if the pressure in the vagina could be released in a certain way by the positioning of the body and other methods, he may have an explanation for a possible cure for vesico-vaginal fistula.","Vesico-vaginal fistula is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the bladder and the vagina that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of urine into the vaginal vault. This abnormality is caused by complications in child births or other extreme causes. This female abnormality was very common and Dr. Sims was the leading doctor who experimented, tested, and always tried to seek a solution for this occurrence. His main subjects or guinea pigs were often on African American women. His leading test subject was a slave by the name of Betsy who suffered from this complication. Once the complication was solved for the first time on Mrs. Merrill, Dr. Sims immediately went to his test subject Betsy and performed an operation to heal her infirmities. Throughout the years Dr. J. Marion Sims overcame many medical feats and saved a countless number of women through his expertise, but he is sometimes viewed as a bad guy. According to Dr. L. L. Wall who wrote in The Journal of Medical Ethics, we see that there are some who defend his surgical practice. “Modern critics have discounted the enormous suffering experienced by fistula victims, have ignored the controversies that surrounded the introduction of anesthesia into surgical practice in the middle of the 19th century, and have consistently misrepresented the historical record in their attacks on Sims.” Dr. Wall acknowledges that Dr. Sims used enslaved African Americans as his guinea pigs, but it was not because they were vulnerable, it was due to the incredible suffering they endured on a constant basis. Dr. Sims was the only physician who had an alternative to their pains."],"display_date":"January 10, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-10","locations":[{"id":298,"lat":32.2469172256,"lng":-86.1720796894,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":2192,"tag":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6075,"title":"Family of Andrew Goodman Spoke at News Conference","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"8/6/64","end_date":"8/6/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 06, 1964, <em>The New York Times</em> reported an expression of “grief and hope” by Andrew Goodman’s family to the public at a news conference.

Despite the death of Andrew and the other two civil right workers, the Goodmans remained adamant the three young men “shall not have died in vain[; the] struggle for equality…shall continue” and not end with the slaying of civil rights activists Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael “Mickey” Schwerner.","The three civil rights activists were a part of the Mississippi Freedom Project under CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) which prepared and encouraged men and women to vote in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. Among those opposing the Freedom Project was the Ku Klux Klan, who had approximately 750 members in Mississippi by the 1960s. The prominent presence of the Ku Klux Klan in the state of Mississippi fostered an environment of intimidation in almost every political office and allowed the extremist group to use fear tactics to prevent minorities, such as African Americans, from voting. Schwerner and Goodman, both twenty-one year old, Jewish men from New York City met at the Mississippi Freedom Project training session. Chaney, a twenty-year old African American and Mississippi native brought local knowledge to the team including his navigating skills needed for the back roads of the Magnolia State.","Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner had ridden out on the June 16to investigate the arson against the Freedom School, at Mt. Zion. Shortly afterwards they were arrested on the June 21 for a traffic violation and held until the fine of $20 was paid. Klansmen, working in cooperation with some local police stopped the car, and killed the three men. They burned the vehicle and dumped it in a swamp, and buried their bodies in dam. No one was charged for the murder for the three activists, although nineteen men, including the sheriff and deputy sheriff, from the Lauderdale and Neshoba Counties of Mississippi were arrested for “depriving the three [murdered] victims of their civil rights,” in 1967 according to writer Bill Scheppler.","The news conference held by the Goodman family reinforced the philanthropic behavior the civil rights activists pursued in Meridian, Mississippi. With the loss of these young men, the Goodman family voiced hopes of, personally, continuing their son’s civil rights duties. James Farmer, the national director of the CORE released in the news conference that a drive headed by Jackie Robinson, former baseball player, would collect funds for the Schwerner-Chaney-Goodman Memorial Community Center in Meridian. The openness of the Goodman family created a spirit of resilience in the nation during a time of mourning for the African American community.

Mainly between the two largest political powers the Republicans and Democrats. The politics of the 1880s and the 1890s created an abundance of delays due to the bigotry, internal corruption within each political party, and the extreme competitiveness of elections. As Reconstruction diminished, the status of any freedman may have increased but the discrimination is still there[1].","After the Reconstruction period the Republicans called themselves \"radicals.\" The radicals were averse during the war by moderates and conservative parties led by Abraham Lincoln. After the war by there was an even larger split between the nation the \"Conservatives\" in the South and \"Liberals\" in the North. Radicals were strongly against slavery during and after the war. Moreover, disbelieved ex-Confederates that demanded harsh administration for the former rebels and accentuate civil and voting rights for freedmen, otherwise known as the recently freed slaves.","Although African-Americans gained freedom in the South, they did not gain equality. Despite the Republicans efforts during Reconstruction, many African-Americans in the South still had to deal with the struggles of poverty, the lack of proper education and unemployment. Exhausted and unemployed, many African-Americans moved to cities to search for work. As a result of the migration, the population of African-Americans in the South increased tremendously by roughly 75 percent during the late 1800s. Other freed African-Americans tried to establish farms but lacked the right resources and equipment; they were compelled to rent out land under the sharecropping system. Discrimination in the South intensified with the passage of Jim Crow laws in the 1880s. The Jim Crow laws were racial segregation laws that went into legislation between 1876 and 1965 in the United States. The Supreme Court were still demoralizing and discriminated against African-Americans, shown in the court case of Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896, which declared all “separate, but equal” to be constitutional.","While in Florida around the time of post-Reconstruction a Judge by the name of Hon J. R. Mizell[2], being interviewed about legislation in Winter Park. He explains that there is nothing wrong with the government while he speaks so highly of those in office. He goes on explaining about those in office and how they each have honor and integrity and no fool would go against any of them. Mizell clarifies how it would be childish of individuals to petition on Park Ave because it will result in large amounts of money by both sides; it will increase taxes, deter people from settling. Winter Park had adequately constructed a balanced in profit coming through the town, bringing an enjoyable lifestyle for its residents, all while trying to keep a calm political atmosphere[3].

Lynching, commonly practiced throughout the United States from the 19<sup>th</sup> century until the 1960s, was a method of murder used to control African American behavior. The victims were typically accused of inappropriate behavior towards white women, though historians agree that these charges typically were false. Armwood’s case met with something highly unusual of Maryland lynchings up unto this point: gubernatorial intervention.","Gov. Albert Ritchie had ordered that Armwood be moved out of Somerset County to Baltimore for protection until his trial. However, relentless pressure from the whites in Princess Anne pushed Judge Robert Duer to transport Armwood back to Somerset County, where an angry mob waited for him. The mob broke through the guards and used a telephone pole to batter down the jailhouse door. The mob rampaged the jailhouse, found Armwood, and dragged him to the courthouse lawn where they beat him severely. They then dragged him through the streets into Duer's neighborhood, where they hanged him from a tree near the judge's home. Afterwards his mutilated body was set on fire and abandoned in a lumberyard where it stayed to terrorize the African American community.","Politically, Maryland was sharply divided over issues of race. In general, Baltimoreans identified more with northern progressive thought while residents of rural areas held to southern sensibilities. With the gubernatorial election on the horizon, Gov. Ritchie found himself torn between rural white segregationists on the one hand, and urban progressives and African Americans on the other hand. Baltimoreans were enraged by his refusal to take responsibility for Armwoods' lynching. In response, Gov. Ritchie declared that, “The responsibility for Armwood's being at Princess Anne rests squarely on the shoulders of Judge Duer and State's Attorney Robins.” Ritchie’s reluctance to use his power to administer justice seemed to demonstrate a broader unwillingness to improve the rights of minorities and promote a progressive agenda. In order to recover his reputation in this demographic, Gov. Ritchie sent three hundred National Guardsmen to apprehend four of the men accused of the Armwoon lynching and bring them to Baltimore for trial.

On March 26, 1863, the Confederate Congress passed the Impressment Act, which allowed it \"to impress, or seize, food, fuel, slaves, and other commodities to support armies in the field.\" A 1793 law prohibited African Americans from bearing arms in the U.S. Army, but dwindling recruitment numbers resulted in forcing many slaves to be used for manual labor in the Confederate Army. On the other side of the battle lines, the Union Army initially had trouble recruiting free black men after Lincoln's passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, but President Lincoln would never resort to allowing his men to illegally force African-Amercians, or anyone else for that matter, to join the Union Army against their will; however, even though the Union Army legally enlisted free black men in 1863, it's evident that illegal impressment into the Union Army occured. ","When President Lincoln got wind of news that Kentucky Major General George Thomas and his men were impressing African-Americans into his Union forces, he didn't hesitate to express his dissastication. On June 13, 1864, Lincoln sent a telegram to Thomas accusing his Kentucky Union forces of \"seizing negroes and carrying them off without their own consent and according to no rules whatever, except those of absolute violence.\" Lincoln probably wasn't surprised that such an act would be occuring in a border state like Kentucky. The people of Kentucky were often at odds over the issue of slavery and most Kentuckians were not opposed to the institution --even Major General George Thomas was born into a slave-owning family and wasn't particularly sympathetic to African-Americans. Slavery wouldn't be abolished in Kentucky until December 1865 and Kentucky Union forces probably resorted to impressing black soldiers when the enlistment of free black men weren't meeting their high demands. ","Regardless of the demand that Kentucky Union forces weren't meeting in their recruitment numbers, impressment would not be tolerated under Lincoln's command. Although African-American soldiers in the Union Army suffered from subpar treatment, conditions, and compensation compared to their white counterparts, President Lincoln was aware of these issues and fought to obtain equal pay for black soldiers and equal protection for black POWs who were often heavily mistreated by their Confederate captors. Consequently, it was during the same month that Lincoln scolded Major General George Thomas for impressing African-Americans that Congress granted equal pay for U.S. colored troops. As a leader that believed in projecting a good and just moral code upon his men, President Lincoln demanded in his telegram that Major General Thomas ensure \"making soldiers of negroes is done according to the rules you are acting upon, so that unneccessary provation and irritation be avoided.\" President Lincoln's direct correspondence over the matter of the impressment of black soldiers into the Union Army illustrates his compassion for African-Americans and his no tolerancy policy of impressment and unnecessary violence towards African-Americans."],"display_date":"June 13, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-13","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52914,"lat":38.2526647,"lng":-85.7584557,"zoom":5,"place":"Louisville, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":2978,"tag":"Confederate"},{"id":2977,"tag":"Soldiers"},{"id":2976,"tag":"Telegram"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":1362,"tag":"Telegraph"},{"id":1677,"tag":"Black"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":2706,"tag":"Impressment"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6587,"title":"Edward Gorsuch and his Southern posse defeated at Christiana","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-09-11","end_date":"1851-09-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 11, 1851, Edward Gorsuch, a Maryland slave owner, and a posse of several men including Federal Marshal Kline, descended upon the house of William Parker, in search of escaped slaves. The southerners believed that with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 the retrieval of their slaves would be a swift and cooperative occurrence. However, the small Quaker town of Christiana in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and its inhabitants were prepared to fight for their own lives and for the escaped bondsmen they desired to protect .","Upon following a suspected ex-slave named Joshua Kite to the home of William Parker, a confrontation ensued. Parker forcefully refused to cooperate with those in the posse, as he recalled his conversation with Marshal Kline, “I then told him to take another step, and I would break his neck.” Worried over what events may occur, William Parker’s wife blew a horn in hopes of alerting nearby townsfolk to aid them in protecting the escaped slaves. Following the call for assistance, there came an exchange of gun shots between the southerners and those at the home of William Parker, which left no individuals harmed. According to the personal account of William Parker, he proceeded to call forth several individuals to the window of his home, repeatedly asking Gorsuch if these individuals were the men he was looking for, each of which he denied. Soon after, armed townspeople prepared to defend those they harbored, began to arrive at Parker’s home.","Among the crowd were two significant white men, a miller by the name of Castner Hanway along with a postmaster and storeowner named Elijah Lewis. According to Thomas Slaughter, the author of <em>Bloody Dawn,</em> the southern men viewed the arrival of Castner and Lewis as support for their desire to recapture the escaped slaves. Slaughter believes the concept of support from Hanway and Lewis can be attributed to their white skin color, as members of the posse viewed them as allies, united against their African-American enemies. Upon refusing to assist Edward Gorsuch and his group, the two northern men began advising the Maryland posse to leave because their safety was at risk. Following the further denial of the southern men to leave, a swift and murderous battle ensued, resulting in the death of Edward Gorsuch and the critical injury of his son Dickinson Gorsuch. “Old Gorsuch was lying in the yard in a pool of blood,” specified William Parker, “and confusion reigned both inside and outside of the house.” From this battle, a large Federal trial took place, in hopes of bringing justice to those involved in the conflict. However, according to James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, the government dropped the indictments of the individuals involved and decided not to press any further charges. This can be attributed to the lack of support in the claim that the event was an act of treason. The Battle of Christian strengthened the northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act, through its direct rebellious nature and bringing of action to those who spoke of anti-slavery."],"display_date":"September 11, 1851","search_date":"1851-09-11","locations":[{"id":11090,"lat":40.0378755,"lng":-76.3055144,"zoom":6,"place":"LANCASTER, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1566,"tag":"Fugitive Slave Act"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":825,"tag":"Riot"},{"id":1565,"tag":"Christiana"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6644,"title":"Mobs of Tennesseans lay destruction upon the African Americans of South Memphis","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-05-01","end_date":"1866-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 1, 1866, increasing tension amongst the civilians of Memphis, Tennessee reached its breaking point, as both white and black citizens engaged in a riot that led to the death of African-Americans and destruction of their homes. The <em>Farmer’s Cabinet</em> newspaper reported; “women and children have been burnt alive with the dwellings of the negroes.” Although the riot lasted several days, the initial engagement that triggered the subsequent events of the riot can be traced to a single altercation.","The parties involved included two groups, one contained four Irish American police officers, while the other was composed of a significantly larger number of African-American Union veterans, some of whom were intoxicated. The police officers were tasked with dispersing the black veterans from their location, but when asked to do so, “The ex-soldiers stubbornly refuse to disperse,” stated historian Stephen Ash. In an effort to relieve themselves of the emotionally heightened situation, the police officers withdrew from the crowd and traveled toward a new location, during which they were followed by several individuals from the group of black veterans. The veterans desired to further intimidate the already frightful police officers by firing their weapons into the air, but in a misinterpretation, the police believed the men were firing at them, and fired back into the crowd. This led to an exchange of gunfire with the officers, but the only officer that was injured was John Stevens, who accidentally shot himself in the leg.","Several of the black men from the group chased two of the fleeing police officers, resulting in the critical injuring of one officer, the escape of another, and the death of a black veteran. As information of the encounter spread, several mobs of white citizens, from an array of occupations, converged upon the predominantly black area of South Memphis. The black veterans in the group were ordered to return to their barracks in Fort Pickering, leaving the rest of the African-American community exposed to the violent acts of the mobs.","Over the next several days, violent beatings and killings involving innocent African-Americans occurred. According to Ash, white mobs mainly targeted black individuals in military uniforms. Unfortunately for the black community, the violence was not limited to those in federal uniforms. As the <em>Farmer’s Cabinet </em>newspaper reported several of the vicious attacks imposed upon innocent civilians, “A poor old negro of seventy years…was knocked down and his tongue cut out by the roots.” A letter recollecting the events of the prior days, revealed by William D. Kelley, stated; “Negro men have been shot down in cold blood on the streets...The most prominent citizens stand on the streets and see negroes hunted down and shot, and laugh as it is a good joke.”","Overall, the Memphis riot, according to historian Eric Foner, accounted for forty-eight deaths, five women raped, and the destruction of several prominent buildings in South Memphis, such as homes, schools, and churches. The Memphis riot undoubtedly provided a barrier in the Union’s overall plan for Reconstruction by further dividing white and black Americans through conflict."],"display_date":"May 1, 1866 - May 3, 1866","search_date":"1866-05-02","locations":[{"id":12365,"lat":35.1268552,"lng":-89.9253233,"zoom":7,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":629,"tag":"race"},{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"},{"id":825,"tag":"Riot"},{"id":407,"tag":"Death"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6723,"title":"African-American Work Songs","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-01-01","end_date":"12/31/47","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi all had large state penitentiaries with them, where African-American men and women resided. Many people visited these prisons to listen to and record these talented men and women singing, including the famous folklorists John Lomax, Alan Lomax, and Dr. Harry Oster. The recorded singers talked about their life experiences, including prison, and the way that music had greatly impacted them. Before they became musicians and wrote their own music, each man was involved in work songs while in prison. Work songs are pieces of music that are sung while conducting a task. The songs might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. They are the reason that people visited prisons to record music. ","Prison work songs are a piece of evidence connecting slavery to incarceration. Once African-Americans came to the U.S. as slaves, they sang songs that reminded them of home and their cultural roots as they were in the midst of oppression. Some songs that were sung carried different meanings and messages within them and each song had its own style or rhythm to it. The most common feature of work songs is the call-and-response format where a leader would sing a verse or two and the other men and women would follow with the chorus. To keep every person motivated and in sync while working through the blistering hot or freezing cold days, they sang songs. The work songs were sung to maintain a steady work pace and to keep the beat for the song, the prisoners used their tools. For example, while chopping logs and singing, half of the men would swing their axes down into the log, while the other half of the men were on their upswing. This kept a steady momentum to make work a bit easier and keep the prisoners sane. ","As the prisoners spoke about their music, they provided information about some songs and what the songs meant. One African-American man who stuck out as he was a great singer and very well-known to the public was Huddie Leadbetter (Leadbelly). Leadbelly talked about one song in particular called \"Go Down Old Hannah.\" \"Old Hannah\" is what the prisoners called the sun throughout the south. They sang about the color of \"Old Hannah\" and the pain it brought upon them and their partners or friends working next to them. They wanted the sun to go down for it meant their work day was now over. Here is an excerpt from the song, \"Go Down Old Hannah\": \"Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah / Don't you rise no more. / If you come up in the mornin' / Bring judgement sure. / Well I look at ol' Hannah / She was turnin' red. / Well I look at my partner. / He was almost dead.\" Some work songs were known from prison to prison as they were first sung by African-Americans as slaves. Other songs were unique to the prison itself and had their own-meanings. They are beautiful, powerful and moving pieces of music that hold a great part of American history. "],"display_date":"1867 - 1947","search_date":"1907-07-02","locations":[{"id":52817,"lat":31.9685988,"lng":-99.9018131,"zoom":4,"place":"Texas"},{"id":53068,"lat":32.3546679,"lng":-89.3985283,"zoom":4,"place":"Mississippi"},{"id":53077,"lat":30.9842977,"lng":-91.9623327,"zoom":4,"place":"Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":3384,"tag":"Work Songs"},{"id":3385,"tag":"Prison Songs"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}},{"id":6725,"title":"Eugenics and Perceived Criminality","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/00","end_date":"12/31/55","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the late 1800s, Francis Galton developed the concept of eugenics, the science of improving a population through selective breeding among ideal specimens. By the 1920s, eugenics had been popularized to mean promoting breeding among the “fit” and restricting reproduction among the “unfit.” Many Eugenicists in the early 1900s had parents or grandparents that lived during a time of slavery, and they themselves were certainly exposed to normalized racism, meaning many of these scientists believed that African-Americans were physically, biologically, and intellectually less than Anglo-Europeans. These biases then affected how they performed research, the data they collected and the conclusions they drew and later shared with the general populations.","<em>The Trait Book</em> by Charles Davenport, a strong proponent of eugenics, outlines traits determined in his research to be hereditary. Physical characteristics such as hair, eye color, and genetic diseases are to be expected and are listed. Davenport also includes among “inborn characteristics” criminal or antisocial behavior, such as Vagrancy, Homicide and Assault. Also included are scales of intelligence, special interests, and personality traits such as conversational, sympathetic, and religious, all of which would now be considered unique to an individual. However, <em>The Trait Book</em> was widely utilized by eugenicists around the world to define and categorize individuals. Eugenicist who consulted this book went on to write papers to present to the public  and provided “scientific evidence” to support legislation passed to allow for the involuntary sterilization of criminals and the insane in the 1920s. The prejudice of eugenicists led to a scientifically supported bias of the innate criminality of African Americans.","This perceived criminality of African-Americans began with the enslavement of Africans in the American colonies. Several diseases were said to be present within the Negro race, including “Dysesthesia Ethiopica,” a disease that made slaves mischievous and indolent, as mentioned in Dr. Samuel Cartwright’s Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race in 1851. He stated that “black blood … creates ignorance, superstition and barbarism, and bolts the door to civilization”, that is, being black in and of itself makes one violent and uncivilized.","            Eugenicists such as those that conducted studies at the Fred C. Nelles Youth Correctional Facility consulted <em>The Trait Book</em> to determine criminality, intelligence and aptitude of the Mexican-American and African-American youth incarcerated there. “The research process often confirmed what [Eugenicists] already knew or believed they knew about youths of color”, according to Miroslava Chavez-Garcia’s article. Several innately racist terms such as “nigger type” and “big coon type” were used in a seemingly scientific way to describe the boys studied at the Nelles Facility. This bias also showed through in how the fieldworkers compared the boys’ intelligence to that of the Anglo-European standards, saying in the case of Nathan M., who scored “feeble-minded” and “moron” that he was of “average intelligence for his race”, exemplifying the workers’ belief that African-Americans were inherently less intelligent than Anglo-Europeans. This lower intelligence was thought to contribute to criminality; that those that were less intelligent were more likely to commit crimes."," "," "],"display_date":"1900 - 1955","search_date":"1928-01-01","locations":[{"id":52839,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3387,"tag":"The Trait Book"},{"id":3386,"tag":"Criminality"},{"id":533,"tag":"Eugenics"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}}]}
