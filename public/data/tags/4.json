1798, Georgia banned involvement in the Atlantic Slave trade, followed a decade later by a nationwide ban.  The Constitution had required the ban when signed, and Congress put it into effect on January 1, 1808.  As the Hon. Joshua Giddings announced in a speech to the House of Representatives, the United States;pronounced the African slave trade to be piracy, and those who followed that vocation to be pirates worthy of death.'  All captured Atlantic slave traders in the future would tried for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strong sentiment against the Atlantic trade was not as universal as people imagined.  Many politicians in the South were unyielding in their attempts to reestablish the Atlantic routes.  Fifty years later, a candidate for Mississippi office announced that the the great want of the South is more Negroes, fresh from Africa,' and he was not alone in this idea.  The development of an illegal slave trade started as soon as the law was enacted, and this black market continued for decades.  However, the illicit trade was costly and dangerous, and the already flourishing domestic slave trade replaced the Atlantic trade to a large extent.  The last known delivery of African slaves occurred in 1858 when the Wanderer smuggled 409 slaves from the Congo and Angola into Georgia, near St. Simons Island.  The slavers responsible were not caught."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":1838,"lat":31.0887336961,"lng":-81.4509546531,"zoom":9,"place":"GLYNN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":20,"title":"Southern Commercial Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-05-12","end_date":"1858-05-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1830s, the South was increasingly aware of the North's industrial dominance.  Commercial conventions emerged as a way to close this gap.  The first meetings focused on single, specific issues such as direct trade with Europe or railroad construction.  Later, the conventions would address a wide range of economic concerns.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1858, Montgomery, Alabama hosted the Southern Commercial Convention.  Over 500 citizens, including committees of 3 delegates per state, attended to discuss issues such as African apprentice labor, European trade, and, most importantly, the reopening of the Atlantic slave trade.  On the second day of the convention, speeches were heard from Richard Pryor of Virginia against the reopening, but William Yancey of Alabama spoke in favor.  Yancey gave a lengthy, powerful speech during which he suggested secession as a future option for the South.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular debate is indicative of the main change which had occurred in the conventions since their inception.  Instead of making decisions for economic advancement, the Southern Commercial Convention was used to spout political beliefs, spreading ideas widely in a short period of time.  Recognizing the political danger within the conventions, Northerners spoke out against them.  The New York Times even published a strongly worded piece announcing that it is high time that those [conventions] of the South end in the production of something better than speeches, resolutions, and reports.'  Still, the conventions continued, providing a forum for Southern communication."],"display_date":"May 12, 1858 - May 15, 1858","search_date":"1858-05-13","locations":[{"id":300,"lat":32.2508016784,"lng":-86.1660804753,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":23,"title":"Baton Rouge establishes a colored church\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["After receiving a petition by Baton Rouge citizens, the local government established a colored church and hired a black Methodist preacher, George Menard, to lead the church.  Besides encouraging this and other black churches, townsmen even permitted blacks to attend white churches.  Although the Black Code in Baton Rouge seemed to impress a harsh code of conduct, the authorities rarely enforced these statutes.  Instead, there was more trust in this community, leading to a more peaceful region.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One example of the different attitude Baton Rouge and Louisiana held toward slavery is found in newspapers.  Consistently, the New Orleans Times-Picayune presented favorable articles about blacks and slaves.  For instance, in covering the funeral of a former Savannah mayor, it reported more on the heartwarming response of slaves to his death than on the white response, or even the funeral itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historians recognize that this unique system was due to a variety of factors.  The multiracial Creole society and the strong Catholic influences in Louisiana explain part of it.  However, Baton Rouge also had a different sort of community.  Because it was not a plantation area, slaves were more likely to belong in small numbers to individual families than to reside in large numbers.  Maybe due to this, unlike many Southern areas, the white leaders of Baton Rouge did not fear the spread of antislavery sentiments through black churches, perhaps considering their own influence to be stronger."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":5503,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":26,"title":"State vs. Oscar decided\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the decades before the Civil War, Louisiana began using special tribunals to try slaves accused of violent crimes.

The tribunals were often fraught with errors and allowed prejudices to easily influence verdicts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Louisiana tribunals were indicative of increasingly harsh treatment of slaves by the law.  Vigilance committees became common as groups of citizens banded together to investigate and observe the actions of blacks.  Though some government officials, such as Governor Wise of Virginia, tried to prevent such groups, it was to no avail.  Meanwhile, citizens pressured police authorities to enact stronger rules.

Fremont was decidedly anti slavery, vowing to quell its expansion if elected. Fillmore took a strong stance in support of slavery in an attempt to win southern votes, declaring that if Fremont won, he would not submit to his rule, and the South should not either.  Buchanan took a middle ground, sympathizing with southerners and stating that slavery was an issue for the individual states to decide upon which garnered him southern support.  &lt;br /&gt;All three parties used print as a way to endorse their candidates.  Tickets for both the Democratic and Whig/ American Parties, specifically informed constituents the candidates to vote for in their specific districts when voting day, November 4, came.  The broadsides backing Buchanan and Fillmore are not surprisingly from southern districts while one would be hard pressed to find broadsides for Fremont in the South.  Simply put, Fremont and the Republicans did not have any semblance of southern support in the 1850s.  The Republican Party would not be able to attract many southerners to their ticket until the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, James Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore.  Although, Fillmore succeeded in attracting southern votes, like the majority of New Orleans' residents, Buchanan had more mass appeal.  The defeat of Fremont was seen as a victory in the dispute for control of Kansas by pro slavery advocates, but this victory turned out to be short lived. Buchanan, the fifteenth president and the only bachelor to ever hold the position, is commonly viewed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the nation.

Some thought the revival of the slave trade would alienate the South from other people and countries, while others thought the slave trade would be incredibly beneficial.  Governor Adams of South Carolina was of this mind frame; he thought the slave trade would profit the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Governor Adams not only saw the reimplementation of the slave trade as profitable, but as an economic necessity for the South.  Adams thought that the supply of cotton was diminishing as demand for it was increasing.  According to Adams, the problem was not a lack of sufficient land, but rather a lack of sufficient laborers.  Without laborers to overcome the diminishing supply, other countries would begin to produce cotton, ending the monopoly on cotton controlled by the South.  In Adams' opinion slave labor was only valuable for producing cotton and because the South would no longer have a monopoly on cotton, the need for slaves would become obsolete and the South would have to abolish slavery altogether.  In short, because the supply of cotton was diminishing the South would eventually have to abolish slavery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This logic was skewed and consequently not many new people were drawn to the idea of revitalizing the slave trade.  The South was not unified on the issue of reopening the slave trade and so those who did support it, did not dare to push the matter further than political discourse.

By avoiding taking to hard a stance on slavery, Buchanan was able to defeat Fremont and Fillmore and win the election of 1856."],"display_date":"September 12, 1856","search_date":"1856-09-12","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":71,"title":"The Arrest of a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-08-10","end_date":"1856-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 10th a slave named Henderson, the human property of Edward Gresham, was arrested and caged.  Police officers caught Henderson in an illegal assembly of eleven other blacks, trespassing over private property and carrying fire arms.  Henderson probably faced punishment by the law following his arrest, and then subsequently by his master once released from confinement.  Slave rebellions generally always ended in death for the rebellion's participants.  Since this thwarted attempt did not even carry to fruition, Henderson did not have anything to show for his punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slave revolts like the ones lead by Denmark Vessey in 1822 and Nat Turner in 1831 were still fresh in the minds of slave holders.  There was the ever present fear among slave owners that their slaves would revolt and possibly lead a revolution similar to that which the people of Haiti successfully led.  Like one southerner said because the history of [Haiti] is written in characters so black, so dark, so prominent, we cannot be ignorant of the fate that awaits us (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1).'  In instances such as this one, with the capture of the plotting slave, slave owners made sure to bring their full wrath upon the accused so as to prevent another attempted insurgence from the slave in question and to dissuade others from trying anything similar.  Slave holders always liked to attribute rebellions to northern interference or a bad slave out of the bunch because to accept that slaves were unhappy in their positions would have called into question the institution itself and therefore the livelihood of these southern plantation owners."],"display_date":"August 10, 1856","search_date":"1856-08-10","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":72,"title":"Southern Interpretation of Increasing Sectionalism\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-08-19","end_date":"1856-08-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article written on August 19, 1856, The Daily Dispatch commented on the growing sectionalism between the North and the South in the United States.

A similar speech given by a Louisiana Senator declared the North did not care about the South, except to attack its honor and interests.  These sentiments are noticeably one sided, but nevertheless the fact remained that hostilities and resentment were breeding between the two sides, creating an ever growing rift between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Southerners tended to cast all of the blame to the North.  In the eyes of southerners, northern rabble rousers were to blame for slave unrest and northerners' motivation for the abolition of slavery stemmed from the desire to completely control the South.  Northerners wanted ruin and desolation spread over fifteen of the States of the Union' (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1), according to southerners and by abolishing slavery, the North would achieve this goal.  In the end, Southerners' fears were realized when the abolition of slavery did completely uproot the southern way of life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The South was fighting for property, honor and safety, all that was due to man (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1)' but of course when they said this they meant all that was due to white men with money.  Southerners at the time increasingly felt that the Constitution was a tool employed by the North to subjugate the South.

The Act pleased southerners not only because it allowed slave owners to retrieve their property from anywhere in the country, but it gave other people the power to retrieve them as well.  In fact, if officials did not turn in fugitive slaves, they could be fined 1,000.  This measure of the act served to directly overturn the decision in Prigg vs. Pennsylvania which formerly declared that states did not have to aid in the recapture of slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fugitive Slave Act was a source of strife between the North and the South because many northerners did not feel the law was warranted nor justified.  Consequently, some northerners chose to directly disobey the act and not aid in the seizure of runaways at their own risk.  As a result, posters and advertisements for runaway slaves like the ones that appeared almost daily in The Daily Dispatch, were abundant.  In one advertisement, a runaway named Armistead Clarke had fled his mistress in Richmond only to be caught in Henrico County.  One broadside offered a reward for the capture of a slave named Lewis; although Lewis, as reported by his owner Thomas Clagett, had a crippled leg and a hernia, he had still fled enslavement.  Clagett's description of Lewis not only demonstrates the lengths to which slave owners would go to recover slaves, but also the lengths to which slaves would go to try and escape; even though Lewis was physically debilitated he still attempted to escape bondage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of advertisements and posters to retrieve runaway slaves was widespread in the 1850s and created an extensive web of people being vigilant over the property of their fellow neighbors.  This sense of community might have been heart warming if this community had not been created to protect slavery.

The Jacksonian idea of equal ability of all' and the Democratic Party's characterization of the common man' was pervasive, while the wealthy landowners and aristocrats still in existence became entrenched in the opposition Whig party.  In January of 1845, a new Constitutional Convention for Louisiana met in New Orleans; progress was slow while citizens expressed their thoughts and hopes for the new Constitution: If tardiness of progress be a characteristic of great bodies, it is an attribute of greatness to which the Convention may justly lay claim.  Thus far their motion has been particularly slow , a snail-pace gait; but it is to be hoped that when rules for the government of their proceedings are adopted, and when, having erected their scaffolding, they set about in good sooth, to build up the new Constitution, the work will proceed more rapidly, and when executed be worthy of the architects who undertook the enterprise, and of the State, the monument of whose wisdom and the temple of whose liberty it is at once designed to be.'","This new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 embodied the Jacksonian ideals and feel.  It sharply restricted the power of the state to lend money and forbade the state from becoming a stockholder; it also prohibited lotteries, dueling, legislative divorces, the official granting of monopolies, and restricted the state's power to issue charters.  The new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 eliminated property holding requirements for holding public office, and established total population (including free whites, voteless free blacks and slaves) for the use of apportionment in the state senate, while the state house of representatives was still apportioned by voter population.  The new constitution also made strides in the state sector of education by creating the office of superintendent of public education and by pushing the legislature to establish public schools.

Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":104,"title":"Florida Admitted as the 27th State\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-03-03","end_date":"1845-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The presidential approval of Florida's entering the Union as a (slave) state occurred on the last day of Tyler's administration.

This particular group of Southern Baptists did not oppose slavery, as the Triennial Convention and the ABHMS had begun to do.  The Baptist Board, situated in Boston, in November of 1844, adopted certain resolutions, one of which stated that if, however, any one should offer himself as a missionary, having slaves, and insist on retaining them as his property, we could not appoint him.  One thing is certain, we can never be a party to any arrangement which would imply approbation of slavery.'&lt;br /&gt;293 delegates from local churches, state conventions, educational institutions, and missionary societies met in Augusta, Georgia, and formed the Southern Baptist Convention, which was led by W.

Although the Northern Baptists (ABHMS) recognized the right of the Southern branch to break away, they described it as a hugely important and momentous act: They have severed, with one blow, the union which has so long existed.  They had united with the North for no prescribed or certain period.  The union was to last during pleasure, and during pleasure only.  The South, therefore, had a right for any cause, or for no cause, to separate from the North.

Its editor, Cassius Marcellus Clay, was an outspoken abolitionist from the South (a Whig from Kentucky).  His arguments against slavery usually were primarily economic in nature, thus appealing to the self-interests of farmers and small slaveholders that, at the time, were feeling the effects of severe economic depression in the tobacco market.  Clay listed several reasons why slavery was inefficient: it impoverishes soil', slaves weren't as skillful, energetic, or full of self interest' as whites, slaves supposedly produced less and consumed more than freemen, and slavery caused the poor to despise labor by degrading' it, while at the same time turning slaveholders into lazy, idle people.  He also argued that slavery caused national poverty, kept economic development from occurring at the pace that it could have by restricting education, diverting funds into slaves, and discouraging development of skills.&lt;br /&gt;Clay was correct to fear pro-slavery forces in Lexington; he fortified the office of the True American with cannons, rifles, lances, and a keg of gunpowder, and carried weapons with him wherever he went.  The Christian patriot' John G. Fee, who also harbored antislavery sentiments, experienced the threat of violence against Clay in Kentucky himself: About this time, at my suggestion, a petition was sent to Cassius M. Clay, requesting him to come to Lewis County, July 4th, 1846, and make to us an address on the subject of slavery and emancipation. The call was signed by twenty-seven citizens, to be sent to Mr. Clay.  Mr. Clay accepted the invitation, commended highly the courage of the men who had made the call, but sent back the sad intelligence that he must defer the purposed address until his return from the war with Mexico;This stirred the slave power, especially in Mason County, the adjoining county. ","An article appeared in the <em>Maysville Eagle</em>, which in some respects misrepresented the statement of the former, by saying: This is as rank Abolitionism as was ever uttered by Birney or Tappan. No slaveholder is hereafter to receive the votes of these simon-pure liberty men; and they who dare to apologize for the institutions of our country are thus denounced and proscribed, and this is heralded forth as the sentiments of Lewis County.';Mr. Clay, having declined then to come, and the slave power raging, some ten men of the twenty-seven who had signed the call inviting Mr. Clay to come, took back their names; and upon myself, Mr. Clay's correspondent, were gathered the severest anathemas, and threats of violence and of the utter destruction of my house;My friends expected the threatened violence, and a man whom we knew as a friend and one who had opportunity to know the movements of our enemies came three times during the day and entreated that I leave my home or I would certainly be killed.

Soon after this the prime mover was killed by a tenant;Another man who shot at me whilst I was sitting in my house, was soon afterward drowned in the Ohio river.'

He was wearing a well-worn black, cloth coat and well-worn shoes.  The woman was described as being darker in complexion, stout and well-made, with a whip mark across her cheek and pregnant.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman, known for being a flight risk, also ran away from an owner, John Boowie of Fauquier County, 18-20 months prior to this incident.

It was also known that she had other clothing items that had not been recollected.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For slaves, running away was the most common form of rebellion against the institution of slavery.  Slaves, like Priscilla, who were in the habit of running away were liabilities to their owners because of the costs for recapturing them, publishing reward advertisements, bailing them out of jail, and loss of labor.   Runaways made it difficult for slave owners to maintain an efficient work force due to the time and energy spent on the problem.

The secret document that emerged from the trip, the so-called Ostend Manifesto, was leaked to the New York Herald and contained aggressive language that greatly embarrassed the Pierce administration. It called for the United States to purchase Cuba at any price' and suggested that if Spain were to refuse the offer, the United States would be justified in wrestling' Cuba from Spain.

With the backing of Delaware Senator Louis McLane, they presented a petition by the American Colonization Society (ACS) requesting the Senators and Representatives of that State, in Congress, to use their best efforts to facilitate the removal of such free people of color as may desire to emigrate to the colony in Africa, and to ensure to them the protection and patronage of the United States'. &lt;br /&gt;Clarke added some riders to his proposed bill in Congress, another one pertaining specifically to slavery: requesting the President of the United States to call the attention of the British Government to the subject of slaves, the property of citizens of the United States, who make their escape into the British Province of Canada.'  The bill was sent to the Whole House Committee where it would spend a great deal of time being debated and edited but never passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bill was important because it showed the increasing resistance to free blacks in the United States.  The free black was of little use to many Americans North and South because they could not be seen as reliable or hard working as the slave or they might harbinger delusions' of equality.  Irish and German immigrants saw that since blacks no longer constituted free labor they were now competing with these inferiors' for jobs in unskilled labor, which could be seen, in the eyes of the immigrants, as a hindrance to their well being.  The problem was most people did not know exactly what do with them, and where they fit on the social hierarchy but it was certainly not equal to any white man.  Gradual emancipation was becoming a topic of merit, but could they really survive in the land that oppressed them for so long.  To several people, blacks could be free just not here.  Many were so moved they had already serviced a ship, the brig Doris with Captain Matthews for Virginian free blacks willing to embrace this opportunity'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this was not a majority opinion.  Some believed that slavery was serving a good, eradicating their natural savagery' and that a trip to Africa would be unsuitable for these newly civilized' blacks. Therefore, this petition was not completely supported by any one area.  Fear would not really play a role until after Nat Turner's rebellion and free blacks were seen as a catalyst towards revolt.  The main impetus was maintaining social superiority but the plan failed because of wealthy slave owners' hostility in the South to any discussion on the topic.  Though not speaking for the entire South, they were a substantial part of the higher social ladder, and therefore a force to be reckoned with.  Congress feared the backlash from irate plantation owners, infringing on property rights' struck severe Constitutional problems for some Congressmen.  The American Beacon put it this way It was opposed by others as containing principles injurious to a certain description of property and contemplating an immediate emancipation'.

Indeed, at the Convention there was never any option to vote against slavery. The proslavery forces refused to allow the subject to become an issue. Clearly the will of the people was being subverted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kansas has been seen as a point of contingency for both sides of the Free state/ Slave state debate for quite sometime, as can be seen in editorials reporting the opinion on the issue published in newspapers such as the Nashville Union and American as early as July 1, 1857. Both sides believed that Kansas was the key to the future; if Kansas was on their side then the rest of the territories would follow suit.  Both sides also knew, however, that if the true populace of Kansas were to speak it would declare it self a free state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Southern Democrats found themselves in an especially tricky bind over this controversy in Kansas.

On one hand the Democratic Party stood for the principle of Popular Sovereignty and the right of the resident citizens to determine their status as free or slave for themselves, as had been expounded in the Nashville editorials back in July. However, with the approach of autumn, it became increasingly evident that if these ideals were followed, it would lead to a free Kansas, giving the North the upper hand. This conflict in Kansas, thus, became a source of great disunion within the national Democratic Party, leading to the irreparable split between Buchanan and Douglas.

Unlike most slaves, Douglass was literate and could therefore taste the pleasures of freedom. This desire was also augmented by his location in the upper south.  While such a position eased some of the burdens of bondage,' it also increased one's knowledge of potential autonomy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglass's account of his mind state prior to the escape is particularly instructive.  In his narrative he describes the conflicting emotions and pulls to both remain a slave, and attempt escape.  He comments that, like other slaves, his knowledge of geography and the distance of his escape route was largely unknown - slave owners portrayed slave territory as endless.  However, lack of a secure plan and potential danger could not outweigh the appeals of freedom, regardless of its remote possibility.  In reference to his mentality and that of his coconspirators, Douglass writes, I believe there was not one among us who would not rather have been shot down than pass away life in hopeless bondage.'  It is clear that the privilege of education played a role in such an assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future impact of Douglass's escape was pervasive.  A skilled and artful author, the writings of Douglass were able to strike an emotional chord with nearly all those who read them.

In short, Mexico had violated its own Constitution of 1836.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texans, and some frontier Mexicans, no longer felt that Mexico City understood or supported their interests.  The seeds of revolution had, of course, been sown with the arrival of Anglo settlers to the province, but it was Santa Anna's adoption of centralist policies and imposition of military occupation that provoked open rebellion.  Further, Texans worried that the Mexican government would limit or outlaw their use of slaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after adopting the declaration, the delegates appointed Sam Houston to the post of commander in chief, and began negotiating the terms of Texas's constitution.  The document they agreed upon strictly limited the power of the government by instituting shorter terms for public officers than in the U.S., and it also explicitly defined the measures by which slavery would be protected.  Notably, immigrants would be allowed to bring slaves from other states, and no free black person could inhabit Texas without the congress's approval."],"display_date":"March 2, 1836","search_date":"1836-03-02","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":449,"title":"House of Representatives passes the first gag rule on slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-05-26","end_date":"1836-05-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["First introduced to the House floor by South Carolina's James Henry Hammond, the gag rule was a radical measure designed to completely eliminate debate dealing with abolition.  Traditionally, representatives received and tabled antislavery prayers, or buried them in committee; the gag rule, however, prevented even this formality from taking place.  This was not a spontaneous development, but a response to repeated petitions from John Quincy Adams and others to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C.  The argument adopted by Southerners was that the existence of slavery was enshrined in the Constitution, and that there could be no legitimate way to entertain petitions for abolition.  Furthermore, to eliminate slavery in the capital would establish a spot, within the slaveholding States, which would be a city of refuge for runaway slaves,' according to the Globe.  By passing such a law you introduce the enemy into the very bosom of these two States [Maryland and Virginia], and afford him every opportunity to produce a servile insurrection... When slavery ceases to exist, under the laws of Virginia and Maryland, then, and not till then, ought it to be abolished in the District of Columbia.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northern representatives were furious at the Southerners' attempt to force the passage of this overtly sectional legislation.  They would not accept that anti-slavery petitions were unconstitutional.'  The gag rule was undoubtedly a radical idea.  That the Southerners would advocate such an extreme measure to preserve slavery demonstrates the explosiveness of the slavery issue over a decade before the Civil War.  Southern Whigs promoted the measure aggressively and without compromise so as to make Southern Democrats feel less comfortable about their New York-born presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren.  This tactic led to more emphatic declarations of loyalty to slavery on both sides.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gag rule passed, in large part, because Van Buren put forward a toned-down version of the legislation that was acceptable to more representatives.  His support of the gag rule was politically expedient, as it helped bolster his popularity in the South.  But the controversy helped to further polarize the pro- and anti-slavery camps.  At the same time southern Whigs were attempting to show that Van Buren's lukewarm support for the gag rule constituted a betrayal of slavery, northern Whigs condemned the Little Magician for supporting the measure at all.  This internal contradiction was of lesser importance in 1836, since the Whigs planned to nominate several different candidates for the presidency.  In future years, though, the divide over slavery would lead to the disintegration of the party."],"display_date":"May 26, 1836","search_date":"1836-05-26","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":450,"title":"Arkansas enters the Union as a slave state\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-06-15","end_date":"1836-06-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The territory of Arkansas began its push for admittance to the Union in 1833, but some Congressmen, as well as many Arkansas citizens, thought statehood could wait until the population had grown considerably.  After all, they benefited financially from their status as a territory.  However, the need to draft a Constitution and petition Congress for admission became more urgent when Michigan made its state ambitions known.  As with most political issues of this period, the consideration of slavery played a decisive role.  If Michigan became a state before Arkansas, the equilibrium of free and slave states in the Senate would be tipped in favor of the free states, and Arkansas would encounter much greater opposition.  Legislators on both sides of the Mason-Dixie line saw this, and so congressional negotiations on the subject initially resulted in a stalemate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kentucky Gazette explained the situation this way: [To delay the vote] was looked to as the only way of defeating the right of the States, entitled to a place in the Union, from obtaining that right, so as to exert it in the next presidential election.  Thus was the motive which induced the joint effort of the abolitionists and nullifiers to deprive the two States of their most unquestionable rights, and whole object for which this species of chicane has been put in practice, has been to exclude great masses of freemen from the elective franchise, in the choice of the Chief Magistrate, and to accomplish this, they were ready to sacrifice every other subordinate interest of two powerful communities.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the presidential election played a considerable role, as well.  Democrats lusted after Arkansas for its potential electoral votes in favor of Van Buren.  In the end, they managed to push the bill through.

As such, his victory in the 1836 election was by no means inevitable; he was widely considered a compromising Yankee who could not be trusted to respect states' rights or slavery.  Southern whites already felt greatly threatened by the perceived expansion of Abolitionism in the North, as evidenced by their efforts to pass the first gag rule' on anti-slavery measures.  Mississippi's Woodville Republican asked, If Abolition continues to advance with giant strides, what will it do with a Northern President when the Southern vote is unwanted?  What will it do under Martin Van Buren, himself more than suspected, proved by his public acts, to be an advocate of the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District and Territories?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point in the Jackson administration, many former supporters of the president thought he had overstepped the bounds on executive power when he destroyed the Bank of the United States.  South Carolinians held a special grudge, thanks to his strong nationalistic stance during the Nullification Crisis of 1832.  Thus in some places, it hurt Van Buren to be considered the legacy of Andrew Jackson.  His status as a Northerner, of course, dampened his popularity throughout the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the election was close, Van Buren carried seven Southern states: Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.  Whig candidates William Henry Harrison and Hugh White carried Kentucky, Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee and Georgia White took the latter two states while Independent Willie Person Mangum took South Carolina.  In stark contrast to the election of 1832, in which Jackson won 79% of the slaveholding states' Electoral votes, Van Buren came away with a mere 53%.  Of the popular vote, he earned an unconvincing 50.9%.  The Whig strategy to prevent a Van Buren majority by running three different candidates with strong regional appeal very nearly succeeded.  This is indicative of the dramatic political dynamics of the 1830s and 40s, which saw the Democratic Party's hold on the South temporarily slip as the Whigs gained strength."],"display_date":"November 1836","search_date":"1836-11-15","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":500,"title":"The Macon Messenger refutes charge that Hugh White escorted a free black to the election polls.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-10-18","end_date":"1836-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 18, 1836, two articles appeared in the Southern Recorder denying that Whig presidential candidate Hugh White upon one occasion did actually walk to the Ballot Box, arm in arm with a free negro.'

He was quoted by the Mobile Commercial Record as saying: The General Government, to which the great trust is confided, of preserving inviolate the relations created among the States by the constitution, is especially bound to avoid, in its own action, any thing that may disturb them.  I would, therefore, call the special attention of Congress to the subject, and respectfully suggest the propriety of passing such a law as will prohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation in the southern States, through the mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.'  This idea was almost universally supported by Southern legislators, but John C. Calhoun and a few others remained dubious.  Even though Calhoun was a staunch advocate of slavery, it looked like an infringement upon states rights for the federal government to decide which publications the post office would be allowed to transmit.  Calhoun's position, while seeming rather paradoxical on the surface, was actually quite logical: if Congress claimed the power to restrict antislavery mailings in 1836, what would stop it from censoring proslavery mailings a few years down the road?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heated debate over the bill took place in June of 1836.  After failing to pass on the third reading, a June 27 issue of the Mobile Commercial Record attacked Southern Whigs as being responsible for its defeat.  The vote would have been 24 in favor and 20 against, as opposed to the 25 to 19 vote that killed the bill.  This bill then, which has been deemed so essential to the tranquility if not to the very safety, of the South, was lost partly in consequence of the Whig opposition from the slave holding section; Whatever then of agitation or of panic, or of mischief may arise from this defeat, let those 5 Whig Senators from the slave holding States share the responsibility.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fear of Southerners was very real.  In the first half of the 1830s, hundreds of thousands of anti-slavery publications descended from the North, which both terrified and infuriated Southerners.  When South Carolina-born abolitionist Angelina Grimk? published her Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, the pamphlet was burned in Charleston and its author forbidden from visiting her native city ever again. Southern efforts to restrict the circulation of such materials, therefore, made sense.  Still, Senators Webster, Clay, Calhoun and other influential senators were not ready to stomach such censorship.

Between the years of 1833 and 1843 Scott lived in Illinois (a free state) and a part of the Louisiana Territory that barred slavery under the Missouri Compromise of 1820.  When he returned home to Missouri, Scott claimed that after living in a free state he had become a free man and was no longer a slave.  Scott's master, Mr. John F. A. Sanford, claimed that Scott was still a slave under Article III of the Constitution.  Scott filed a petition in the St. Louis Circuit Court in 1846 and after eleven years of idling in the American judicial system, the case reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1856.&lt;br /&gt;Delivering the opinion of the Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled in a 6-3 majority that slaves were not and could not become citizens of the United States and thus were not afforded any civil liberties under the Constitution.  Under Article III, persons of African American descent were not citizens of any state at the time of the drafting of the Constitution and were instead considered beings of inferior order' by the drafters of the document.  In regards to the Declaration of Independence's claim all men are created equal,' Chief Justice Taney stated, as reported in the Richmond Daily Dispatch, It is too clear for dispute that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, for in that case, the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of Independence would be flagrantly against the principles which they asserted.'  &lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the court ruled that, under Article V, it could not deprive any man of life, liberty, and property' and since Scott was in fact a slave and not a citizen, he was the lawful property of his owner, regardless if he was in a free state or a slave state.  Therefore, Scott was still a slave according to the law.&lt;br /&gt;In the second time ever, the Court used its power of judicial review to rule an act of Congress (the Missouri Compromise) unconstitutional.  The Court declared that it was beyond the constitutional powers of Congress to enact a law regarding the territories of the states.  Congress could not deprive citizens from taking their property (i.e. slaves) into and out of territories or states.&lt;br /&gt;After the infamous decision was handed down in the spring of that year, a flurry of reactions erupted across the United States.  Democrats were as quick to defend the decision as Republicans were to assault it. Many northerners felt that parts of Chief Justice Taney's decision, specifically declaring the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional, were extrajudicial because they were not necessary for arriving at a decision in the case. Northerners charged that after Chief Justice Taney had shown that Scott, as a Negro, had no right to bring a case into a federal court, he should have ended his decision. Some Northerners went as far as to say the decision was a pro-slavery conspiracy.  Southerners, for the most part, stood firmly by the decision of the Court, refusing to concede that any part of Chief Justice Taney's decision had been extrajudicial. Relationships between Northerners and Southerners were already tense, but the Dred Scott decision served to further polarize the two sides.&lt;br /&gt;Frederick Douglas, a prominent African-American abolitionist, remarked after hearing the decision: The highest authority has spoken.

This had been a highly controversial issue and many continued to disagree with the black involvement. Black soldiers were seen as inferior in ability, and Confederate generals and soldiers did not want to fight along side them, and they didn't trust them.  However, the law was passed and signed by President Davis, and black soldiers, in retribution for fighting were given their freedom. Able bodied black man could fight, and they were able to secure independence and receive the same rations, clothing, and compensation as white soldiers.  Black soldiers in the Confederate ranks were compiled of both slaves and previously freed blacks. Many cried out against the integration, but General Lee stated, If we do not need the negro soldiers, the enemy will.' However, the bills to pass integrated soldiers didn't get to every state, and many prolonged the process, so by the time the Civil War ended on April 9th, there was very little integration of blacks into the army which had occurred.&lt;br /&gt;Congress passes the integrated soldiers bill out of desperation of troops to fight, the South is continuously finding itself at a disadvantage in numbers, and by adding the abundant race of blacks, the odds for a turnaround in the war were more probable. Confederacy integration of black troops was a huge step for southern states as it demonstrated that they could not fight the war alone and needed the help and numbers of black soldiers. Though most Confederates were opposed to the idea, if they wanted a chance in the war, numbers needed to increase. This was also a significant step in Confederate Congress' realization that blacks were able beings who could fight beside white soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;For African-Americans, the integration bill was a ticket to freedom. Slaves had nothing to lose by joining the war as soldiers, and they saw their chance out when laws of integrated troops were passed. The blacks were not interested in fighting for the Confederate Cause; they cared mostly about their fighting as a means to its end. This was the first time blacks could fight for their freedom, it gave them a goal and motivation to succeed as a soldier in order to survive the war and live as freed men."],"display_date":"March 13, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-13","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":596,"title":"Economic Sociology of Enslavement\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Henry Hughes published Treatise on Sociology: Theoretical and Practical at the age of 25 while living in New Orleans.

Only slavery, which combined capital with labor, could introduce benevolence into society.  Without slavery, warned Fitzhugh, there would be class warfare or revolution.&lt;br /&gt;Fitzhugh set himself up against Nott's Types of Mankind because it digressed from the Biblical story of Adam and Eve and because he supposedly encouraged masters to treat their slaves as beasts without humanity.

An immense sum' had been paid to Spain for Florida in 1821, and the territory had been a messy place since, marked by recurring wars with the Seminoles.  As Senator Strange of North Carolina said, the Indians might be whipped, but unfortunately for the country they would not stay whipped.'  The Florida War with the Seminoles had begun in 1835 with the Dade massacre and the ambush of a small force of Americans.  This had convinced the United States government of the need to take more serious actions in Florida.  In 1840, after five years of war, the United States government was getting tired of its failure to subdue the territory.  Accordingly, the Senate was debating measures designed to settle Florida in a more permanent and forceful manner.  &lt;br /&gt;The American reported that the Senate deliberated upon a bill granting up to 10,000 white settlers a bounty of three hundred and twenty acres of land each.'  The men would have to be able and willing to fight, and they would be organized into camps for the purpose of claiming and protecting their own areas of land.  This bill was opposed by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky, who argued that it was not worth maintaining the United States Army in Florida to protect a mass of settlers who would not be establishing farms and homesteads.  Meanwhile, the federal government would be responsible for feeding and clothing these settlers.  He proposed instead that bounties be offered for each Indian killed.  Reports of numbers of Indians killed and the manner in which they died continued to appear in newspapers throughout 1840.  The military forces in Florida even imported bloodhounds from Cuba to hunt down Indians for deportation.&lt;br /&gt;In July, a bill for the admission of Florida as a state came before Congress.  Congress would admit Florida as soon as it reached the requisite population of 30,000.  A second bill also made its way to the Senate floor, this one calling for Florida to be split into two territories and then admitted as two states.  The Charleston Mercury suggested that this bill had been written by abolitionists with the intent of delaying statehood for years so that anti-slavery settlers could flood the territory in the meantime, eventually turning at least one of the halves into a free state.  A free state at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico was something which the Mercury could hardly live at peace with.'  It would be a Botany Bay for superfluous Tappans and Garrisons so near us , better to have the Seminoles.'

This gave free blacks an alternative to the colonization sponsored by the American Colonization Society.  The Liberian colony which the Society sponsored was diseased and overcrowded, considered by many to be a death trap.'  &lt;br /&gt;Colonization had long been a project of abolitionists and slave-holders alike, often resulting as much from a mistrust of freedmen as from the opinion that colonization would be most beneficial to free blacks.  Opinions differed on whether it was even possible for free blacks and whites to coexist in American society.  Northern opponents of abolition had argued early in American history that liberated, propertyless, black men and women would become a burden on society.'  Free blacks on the whole seemed to oppose colonization, and some abolitionists viewed it as a means to strengthen slavery by exporting all the free blacks.  The American Colonization Society itself was a target of abolitionist ire.  Garrison, a former advocate of colonization, wondered how the Society was advancing the cause of immediate emancipation.  He also saw it as something which reinforced racism.  The Society's efforts enjoyed a surge of popularity in the 1830s after Nat Turner's rebellion, but then this support began to wane as finances decreased and as absolute emancipation and full citizenship continued to gain ground in the anti-slavery movement."],"display_date":"March 18, 1840","search_date":"1840-03-18","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":632,"title":"Southerners Respond to Reports of British Cotton Schemes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-03-01","end_date":"1840-07-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In March of 1840, the Southern Cabinet of Agriculture, Horticulture, Rural and Domestic Economy included an article saying our readers are aware, no doubt, that certain parties in England have lately brought up a question as to this subject, which materially concerns this country; viz. whether there is any probability that England can hereafter raise her own supplies of the raw material for her immense cotton manufactories.'  The journal quoted from a report in the London Athenaeum.  British authorities in India had begun to consider the viability of growing all the cotton necessary for their nation in their Indian possessions.  At the time they estimated that Britain imported between 4 and 500,000,000 pounds of cotton per year.  Most of this came from the American South, with only about a tenth being produced in India.  The subcontinent had long grown cotton, but this was generally a household industry and the varieties cultivated were coarser and less valuable than American cotton.&lt;br /&gt;The East India Company sent their agent, Captain Bayles, to the American South to investigate the possibility.  There he recruited American farmers to assist the Company in its cultivation projects.  The Manchester Guardian reported the arrival of several individuals from the United States, with saw-gins and other machinery for the cleansing of cotton.'  The plan seems to have come about not only for current economic considerations, but also so that in the event of war with America, we shall thus, in due time be independent of that country for the supply of a staple commodity of very extensive utility, and productive of no inconsiderable profit.'  The editors of The Charleston Mercury, observing all this, had no doubt that the great Anti-Slavery agitation in London, also set on foot by the East India Company.'  According to some southerners this was a threat to the basis of the southern economy as well as a scheme to undermine the southern slaveholding system.&lt;br /&gt;Over the next decades the British began to build up the Indian cotton industry.  It was not an immediate change.  Steam presses for baling arrived in the 1850s, and in 1854 India saw its first large cotton mill.

Van Buren, running on a platform which tried to appeal to southern interests had many active supporters in the South, including former President Andrew Jackson.  The South, however, would not back him strongly during the campaign and election, despite his denunciation of abolition and his declaration of friendship with the South.'

Robert Gunderson, describing the campaign, wrote that generated as it was by hard times and political hatreds, the great commotion of 1840 was not subject to rational or intellectual restraints.'  Van Buren's Whig opponents in the newspapers characterized the Democratic Party as undemocratic and uninterested in the concerns of the common man.

On the other side ranged the unbought and unterrified friends and advocates of civil freedom.'  Whig partisans also made as much as possible of Van Buren's supposed distance from the people he governed.  The fact that Harrison was a soldier, and had been defending women and children from the Indians while Van Buren had been making money for himself in politics was also emphasized by the Whigs.  Harrison was the honest and brave soldier, the common man's president who lived in a log cabin, the image of a purer republicanism going back to the Revolution.  The southern Whigs, who had initially voted for Henry Clay at the national convention, were happy with Harrison, a Virginia native and southern ally.'  The vice-presidential candidate, John Tyler, was a Virginian defender of states rights and good anti-Jackson Whig.  The ticket seemed to be a solid anti-abolition ticket, which won it friends in the southern states.&lt;br /&gt;The Democrats, on the other hand, disparaged the Hard Cider' campaign message of the Whigs as an attempt to draw attention away from Harrison's shortcomings, especially his record on slavery and states rights.  The Democrats had doubts about his trustworthiness on these issues.  Rather, he was in fact the enemy of old-school republicanism, a latitudinous Constructionist of the loosest school.'&lt;br /&gt;The Whig ticket emerged victorious in November, carrying seven slave states and winning a majority of the southern popular vote.  Harrison's success showed that the West was continuing to grow in importance following the election of Jackson in 1828.  Also, with this election two-party politics had definitely arrived in the South;after 1840 two vigorous parties, each claiming to be the champion of the South, competed on an almost equal footing across the slave states.'"],"display_date":"January 1, 1840 - November 23, 1840","search_date":"1840-06-12","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":643,"title":"The South Discovers Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1840-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A one-time University of Virginia student and sometime resident of Baltimore and Richmond, Poe published his first collection of writings in 1840.  Many of the stories in the Tales had been published previously in various literary journals, such as Godey's Lady's Book and Ladies' American Magazine, and the Southern Literary Messenger, to which Poe was a major contributor.  The new volume received mixed reviews.  One reviewer, writing in the Literary Messenger, thought that to say that we admire Mr. Poe's style, abstractly considered, is more than we can say and speak truly; neither can we perceive any particular beneficial tendency that is likely to flow from his writings.'  The Editors' Book Table had a more favorable response to the book, calling Poe a writer of rare and various abilities' and calling Poe's Tales stories which cannot fail to impress all who read them, with a conviction of his genius.'&lt;br /&gt;Poe later came to be considered the patriarch of the American mystery and detective story.  He was one of few stand-out southern writers of his day, and from a purely artistic viewpoint he surpassed all his southern contemporaries, but his work did not concentrate on the southern experience.'  A New Englander by birth, he lived much of his life in the South and identified most with that region, including its slaveholding institution.

In the Baltimore American in January, there was an article commenting on the controversy between Maine and Georgia over the abduction by two citizens of Maine of a Georgian slave.  Southern slaveholders demanded the protection of their property, but northern states had a good states rights basis for refusing to cooperate in matters of fugitive slaves.  The American was pleased in this case to be able to say that the correspondence between the two states had thus far been conciliatory.'&lt;br /&gt;Despite cases of slave abduction and rescue, the North as a whole was not abolitionist.  Free blacks in the north faced the prospect of being arrested and returned as fugitive slaves according to the 1793 national fugitive slave act.

Upon the city's retrocession into Virginia, slavery in Alexandria (which many considered the center of the slave trade in the region) would be protected should the practice be banned in the District itself.

On February 25, the National Intelligencer reported a gathering of a group who opposed the measure.  This group argued that Congress could not pass the resolution without the consent of a majority of the city's citizens, and this was coupled with some lawmakers' fears that if such a large part of Washington, D.C. were removed (Alexandria was at this time ten square miles) the federal government might feel no incentive to remain in that location.  On the whole, however, the people of Alexandria as well as those living in Virginia welcomed the passage of this legislation.

They noted that despite the fact that in Africa they had had access to large tracts of land, fertile soil, and other rich natural resources, they had made no progress in the refinements of civilization'.  They hoped that by re-colonizing them in Africa, they would be able to convert more people on that continent from their gross and abject superstitions' to Christianity.  Other groups had similar ideas.  The American Society for the Return of Negroes to Africa was founded in Richmond in 1817, with a stated mission that was nearly the same.

They decided that any proposed colony would have to be far away from American soil to have the intended effect of separating free blacks from the enslaved blacks, and from the free whites, with whom they can never be equal.  The point of this separation was to diffuse any conflicts that might erupt should the free blacks get frustrated with the injustice and turn to violence.  So if the land must be far away, where would it be, and how would the government obtain it?  Great Britain already had a colony for free blacks in Sierra Leone.  The Congress discussed sending free American blacks to that colony, as well as creating a new colony just for American freedmen.  A new colony would require a rather large monetary contribution from the United States government for the land on which to build the colony, and food until they were able to establish their own farms, as well as military protection for a long time before they could set up their own stable government. Once they did set up a stable government, would the new nation wage war against the oppressors of their brothers, still enslaved in the United States?  If there were an American free blacks colony near a British free blacks colony, how would this affect America's relations with Great Britain?

In May, 1861, three slaves had run away from their master and sought refuge within Union lines at Fort Monroe.  When their master, Colonel Charles Mallory attempted to claim them, General Butler refused. Butler drew on his legal training for his answer.  He called the slaves contraband,' and because they could be used by the Confederates in the war against the Union, he would not return the slaves.  This, of course, contradicted the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850.  But the Confederacy was no longer a part of the United States; therefore, rebelling states were no longer entitled to protection under United States law, Butler reasoned.  His decision infuriated southerners.  Word spread among slaves in the Hampton area, and hundreds of slaves began to flood the Union lines.  Butler employed them in digging ditches, in his words, saving our soldiers from that labor, under the gleam of the mid-day sun.'  Many of the slave women laundered uniforms for the Union soldiers.  The slaves were paid for their labor.  &lt;br /&gt;By July, there were so many former slaves living in the city of Hampton, Butler did not know what to do with them.  He wrote a letter to Secretary Cameron on July 20, published in the New York Times several weeks later.  In it, he asked, What shall be done with them?'  He continued, Are these men, women, and children, slaves?  Are they free?'  He received a reply in August, described in The New York Herald.  The response stated that Congress had passed a new act on August 6.  Fugitive slaves in rebelling states did not have to be returned to their masters, and certainly any slave used in the Confederate war effort was forfeited.  The letter was far from abolition, mentioning reimbursing slaveholders for their escaped slaves after the war.  Still, it was a step toward emancipation, and the importance of the decision was clear to both Northerners and Southerners.  News articles about the so-called contrabands' were common.  An article in December described ex-slaves living in former President Tyler's residence in Hampton.  The basement is occupied as a contraband school-room;there stood about fifty little black children as eagerly pursueing [sic] their studies as any children could,' wrote a reporter stationed at Fort Monroe.

If Bayard could have written the constitutional revisions they would have led to the end of slavery and allowed free blacks to gain citizenship.&lt;br /&gt;The debate over the Constitution was a catalyst in the demise of the Whig Party.  During the fall of 1853, the leaders from the North and the South did not communicate well.  Both northern and southern Whigs thought that they were each above reproach and the people of North Carolina noted this.  Many North Carolinians according to the Wilmington Journal disliked the arrogance that the Whigs allegedly exuded.  Southern Whigs were wary of the northern Whigs and there attitudes towards slavery.  They feared that the disparity in their views on slavery would hurt not only the Whig party, but the interests of the South."],"display_date":"October 1, 1853 - October 31, 1853","search_date":"1853-10-16","locations":[{"id":1257,"lat":39.5008834932,"lng":-75.568787499,"zoom":9,"place":"NEW CASTLE, Delaware"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":833,"title":"Southern disdain for Stowe&#39;s A Key to Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-07-01","end_date":"1853-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1853 Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the companion to her famous novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, and she titled it A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Her purpose in writing the book was to explain why she thought that whites were still unwilling to take pity on slaves.  While Stowe claimed that she understood that slaves were more than property, she postulated that other whites still saw slaves as sub-human.  Stowe did admit that she did not fully understand blacks, but she thought that by applying Christian kindness to them, their situation might be helped.  One shocking thing that Stowe revealed was that she believed that slaves repulsed themselves; she wrote that they thought they were evil because their skin was black.  She did not think that blacks were capable of reaching the same intellectual and moral heights as whites, and she blames that inability on their disgust in themselves.  Southerners were not at all pleased with Stowe's book.  Critics characterized it as having a narrow field of view.  She was accused of making generalizations about Southerners as being unaffected by the plights of slaves.  This bothered critics who felt that Southerners were not deficient in their morality.  One critic tried to explain that the North had the same prejudices as the South.  He wrote wherever man is found, we find equally the same vices, crimes, and weaknesses.   Southerners were also alarmed at the lack of biblical references in <em>A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  They felt that she was writing too righteously not to be using the Bible.  The outrage caused by Stowe's book in South was significant because it exemplified the schism between what southerners thought about northerners, what northerners thought about southerners, and the truth."],"display_date":"July 1, 1853","search_date":"1853-07-01","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":884,"title":"Emancipation Proclamation issued\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1863-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation through his Secretary of State, William Seward. The proclamation decreed that slaves in the rebellious counties of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia were to be set free. Those territories excepted were those over which the Union army had seized control during the Civil War. The list of states was notable, because although Tennessee had rebelled, it was excepted from the enumeration of affected states.&lt;br /&gt;The simple language of the manumission of the slaves was not terrible effective in its own right. The proclamation did only apply to those areas in which the Confederacy governed. One northerner described the government as having no power to enforce the decree;the paper is a dead letter.' However, the declaration that the government would recognise and maintain the freedom of such persons' was a much more promising measure since this clause would have a tangible effect at the conclusion of the fighting. Not even all Northerners were in agreement with his proclamation, suggesting that the President may free slaves so far as may be necessary to the success of his military operations,' but that any further freeing of slaves would enable the President to gain de jure control over the law of slavery.' &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln saw emancipation as a measure of expedience in a war-torn nation. In a letter to Horace Greeley, he expressed his ambivalence: If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union.' The Emancipation Proclamation was no surprise to the country. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln had issued a preliminary proclamation noting that on January 1 of the subsequent year, he would issue the statement that he did. He was not held to that promise, however. His local paper gave him some leeway: He was perfectly free to exceed or to fall below the line of conduct marked out in his preliminary proclamation of September 22d.'&lt;br /&gt;Besides its primary purpose in renewing enthusiasm towards winning the war, the act was a major step in the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States, making abolition a national issue central to the Civil War, and it give interested parties around the world reason to take note. The major effect of this proclamation came about as the Union took control of Confederate states and freed the slaves therein. In addition to adding a dimension of morality to the way, it also attracted international interest as a statement on human rights. The Southern perspective of this event, however, was drastically different. Lincoln's speech, described as the world's most pitiable spectacle,' was vague' and visionary' and had already failed in practical application.' The South was amenable to a discussion of compensated emancipation, but outright rejected Lincoln's notion that he either ought to or had the authority to emancipate their slaves."],"display_date":"January 1, 1863","search_date":"1863-01-01","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":902,"title":"North Carolina Slave Uprising Plot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-12-23","end_date":"1852-12-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Around the time Christmas 1852, a furor erupted in a rural county of North Carolina over the uncovering of the alleged plot of 17 slaves to murder their master's overseer and ignite a larger slave rebellion.

Johnson's commutation ignited a tumultuous debate and uproar throughout the state of Virginia.  On the night of the commutation, a violent and unruly crowd of over 2,000 whites gathered outside of Richmond's City Hall to denounce Johnson and his commutation.  The untamed mob began to damage property and threatened to storm City Hall.  Some factions of the crowd began to demand that either Hatcher be released to the crowd to be lynched or the crowd would threaten Governor Johnson.  The Virginia Guard had to be deployed to subdue and disperse the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent gatherings to protest the commutation ensued over the following weeks.  Legislation censuring the Governor and overriding his commutation were contemplated, but eventually abandoned after appeals for Democratic unity from prominent politicians.  Several weeks of debate in the Virginia General Assembly were devoted to commutation fallout.  While Democrats were eager to vilify Hatcher as a murderous beast, they were reticent to denounce Johnson as this may have been perceived as sanctioning the lawless mob.  As in North Carolina, slaveholders were extremely concerned about uncontrolled lynch mobs of lower class whites who may seize or damage their property. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several gatherings were also held in Richmond to denounce the mob riots of 7 May.  The firestorm over Johnson's commutation exposed rifts in the Virginia Democratic party between the largely slaveholding Eastern counties and the recently enfranchised and largely non-slaveholding Western Counties.  While Eastern slave-holding Democrats in the General Assembly called for the imposition of stricter controls over Virginia's slave population, most notably to prohibit slaves from living away from their masters, no meaningful laws were passed in response to the commutation.  In fact, leniency toward slaves convicted of capital crimes developed as a pattern in Virginia jurisprudence over the next eight years.  Slaveholders were united in their opposition to lynch mobs and considered government interference in their administration of their slaves as an encroachment on their right to own, discipline and govern their own slaves."],"display_date":"May 7, 1852","search_date":"1852-05-07","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":922,"title":"Lincoln&#39;s Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-12-08","end_date":"1863-12-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lincoln issued this proclamation with hopes of expediting Reconstruction.

Her older sister, Emily, was also her godmother, and the two were very close.  Both sisters grew to despise slavery.  They moved to Philadelphia to join the Quaker Society of Friends and took up the abolitionist cause in the mid-1830s, eventually joining the American Anti-Slavery Society.  In 1836, the women moved to New York to become public advocates of abolitionism.  In September of that year, Angelina published an Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, reasoning that an essay addressed to women would reach the whole community, not just the men. The Appeal relied heavily on religious teachings.  Slavery was a sin, she said, because it caused human beings to be treated as objects.  It stripped them of all their God-given rights.  But even more compelling than her abolitionist arguments were her recommendations to the women of the South.  She encouraged them not only to pray over the matter, but to speak and act out against slavery.  The women of the South can overthrow this horrible system of oppression and cruelty, licentiousness and wrong.  Women could petition their state legislatures with the assurance that their opinions would be heard, for there is something in the heart of man which will bend under moral suasion.  She vehemently denied the accusations that abolitionists sought to provoke violence in the South, but prophetically proclaimed, There is no doubt there will be a most terrible overturning at the South in a few years, such cruelty and wrong, must be visited with Divine vengeance soon.  "," Angelina hoped that her status as a devout Christian woman and Charleston native would lead Southerners to listen to her as they had never before listened to abolitionists. She was sorely mistaken.  Immediately following its publication, Charleston's postmaster gave the Appeal the same treatment he gave all abolitionist literature: he ordered it publicly burned.  Southern hatred of abolitionists was more intense than ever at this time; Southern legislators had nearly succeeded in passing a universal ban on the circulation of incendiary literature in the South.  Angelina's mother was notified by Charleston police that if her daughter ever returned to the city for a visit, she would be arrested, imprisoned, and sent North on the first available ship.  Friends wrote to Angelina to warn her of the mob violence she would surely encounter if she came back.  The indignant response was natural; it was strictly taboo for Southern women to venture into the public sphere, much less to speak out against slavery.

In 1830, white slaveholders consisted of only 35% of the white population of Maryland, yet controlled 60% of the seats in the state legislature -- a fact which was all to prevalent to many anti-slavery whites and to free blacks. Most of these slaveholding whites lived in the southern, peninsular parts of Maryland, and they were opposed by the more urban northern parts of the state. Henry Brawner, for example, lived in Charles County where 57% of the population was enslaved and he himself owned 58 slaves worth over 30,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was in direct contradiction to northern Maryland where 35% of the non-Baltimore black population was free, the number within Baltimore itself being even higher. This shift in northern Maryland is evidenced by looking at Maryland's different newspapers and in the reactions of white slave owners. For example, the Annapolis-based Maryland Gazette lists a number of runaway slave notices, as well as a May 13, 1830, advertisement to purchase one hundred likely negroes.' This is directly contrasted by the Baltimore based Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser, where one is hard pressed to find a single such notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White slave owners reacted to this growing free black population -- and the general anti-slavery liberalization -- of northern Maryland in a number of ways. Henry Brawner, for one, chaired a committee which urged the expulsion of free blacks from the state. In addition, both whites and some free blacks pushed recolonization' of blacks back to Africa as well as what the Baltimore American calls on January 14, 1830, the African colony in Canada.' This debate over what to do with Maryland's free black population continued throughout 1830 and the following decades, especially as the number of white slave owners fell in proportion to the more anti-slavery -- or at least anti-domination by slave owners -- northern Marylanders who begun to take more control over the state government."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":5971,"lat":38.28057998,"lng":-77.0012385843,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1091,"title":"Passage of the Civil Rights Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-04-09","end_date":"1866-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Civil Rights Act, which put forth in detail the rights of former slaves, was passed by the United States Congress on April 9, 1866. On January 5th, 1866 Senator Trumbull from Illinois had presented A Bill to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and furnish a means for their vindication.' In an effort to counteract the Black Codes passed in many southern states after their reincorporation into the union.  The bill dictated that, the inhabitants of every race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery...shall have the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue...to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property...' The Act not only guaranteed these rights to African-Americans, but also made it illegal for others to infringe upon these rights.&lt;br /&gt;President Johnson did not believe that former slaves were qualified for citizenship so he vetoed the bill. The House of Representatives voted to override the President's veto by a substantial margin. In the Senate, they barely attained the two-thirds majority required to override, thanks in part to the providential absence of two Senators, friends of the veto,' as reported by Daily National Intelligencer.  With the two-thirds vote in both Houese, Johnson's veto was overridden by Congress, the first time this had ever happened in American history. Some thought that President Johnson might not enforce the act if his veto was overridden, but the Knoxville Whig reported that if its (Congress') members conscientiously considered that they ought to pass it, he would not object, and would carry out its provisions so far as they depended on him.' Henry J. Raymond, the Editor in Chief of the New York Times and Representative in the House, called it, one of the most important bills ever presented to this house for action.'&lt;br /&gt;The Civil Rights Act of 1866 has great historical significance because it formally established the rights of the freedmen and made it a crime for these rights to be infringed upon. In his autobiography, James L. Smith, a former slave, wrote of all the injustices done against blacks previous to the act, but he stated that, When the civil rights bill was passed...the condition of the colored people was ameliorated in many instances.' For many blacks the Civil War did not end at Appomattox, but on April 9th, 1866 when the rights of African-Americans in this country were officially established."],"display_date":"April 9, 1866","search_date":"1866-04-09","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1143,"title":"Iron is used for Railroads\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-01-11","end_date":"1844-01-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ever since John Smith arrived on American soil, boats have been a major medium for transportation. Water and boats were the only adequate forms of transportation and ultimately trade. As a cycle of reinforcement, water transport promoted trade and trade promoted water transport. Soon, with the implementation of newer materials, lighter resources and fresher ideas, boats become better and faster then before. Access to a body of water was so necessary to means of living in the 18th Century that the upper class would buy isolated houses on the water front. As long as they had access to water they did not need neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;Soon thereafter railways and trains were built and a new industrialized form of trade emerged into the South. Railroads soon became another medium of trade, though not as reliable or as fast as one would have liked. The greatness of employing trains, however, meant that resources and commodities could be found and transported to places within the states that were not on or near a body of water. In 1844, iron was implemented for both railroads and underground railroads. Southern States that bordered water, had previously relied on steam boats and water for essential transportation needs. Now, they had a fast and reliable alternate form of transport. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads provided for more unity within the states, whereby people could travel across the country for leisure. It also provided an accessible method for transporting goods and commodities for trade, such as bringing sugar from the south up to the north, which boosted the economy. This improvement also enhanced the infrastructure of America. More importantly though, the railroads were now an easier way for slaves to escape their masters and oppressed lifestyles. Blacks knew that if they made it to the North or Canada, help awaited them. Underground railroads began to flourish all over the country. Wilmington, Delaware is one example of where railroads increased and subsequently blacks were led to freedom.

He received much criticism and praise for his confrontation of abolition.  Whig politics at the time were very two-sided, having to span the boundary between free states and slave states.  His speech to congress in February of 1839 gave his views on abolitionists and their pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;He identified three classes of people opposed to slavery.  The first, and most harmless according to Clay, was the class opposed to slavery by sentiment or philanthropy.  This class, he asserted, disliked the institution but would not upset the union or their own lives for the cause of abolition.  The second class he named the abolitionists.  This group he felt believed that the right of petition had been violated by congress and were more adamant to their cause, yet no more wanted to cause disunion to the nation.  The third and most dangerous class was the ultra-abolitionists.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay said, with them [ultra-abolitionists] the rights of property are nothing, the deficiency of the powers of the General Government is nothing; the acknowledgment and incontestable powers of the States are nothing; civil war, a dissolution of the Union, and the overthrow of a Government in which are concentrated the fondest hopes of the civilized world, are nothing.'&lt;br /&gt;Also in his speech, Clay addresses a concern on British emancipation of the West Indies.  He says this is unfair as the planters in the West Indies are not represented in British Parliament.  Clay drew a parallel between the ultra-abolitionists and the British parliament as that neither are anywhere near the world they seek to govern and change.&lt;br /&gt;An important clarification made by Clay over the policies of democrats and Whigs was that neither party were abolitionists.  He contests the necessity of abolition in Washington D.C.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay ended with predictions for the future of slavery.  He predicted that slavery would endure for at least 50-100 years, and after that within 150-200 years few vestiges of the black race will remain among our posterity.'

In Harper's Ferry in 1859, he initiated his final public appearance, with his ultimate goal being to begin a massive uprising of enslaved people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insurrection began at about half past ten o'clock on Sunday night.

In the record of The Life, Trial, and Execution of Capt. John Brown, at daybreak a panic appears to have immediately ensued, and the number of insurrectionists was at once largely magnified.

Pinckney remained a controversial political figure, due in part to his support of slavery.  In 1820, he reacted to the attempts of some Northern congressmen to ban slavery from the Missouri Compromise.  An example of the Northern position was demonstrated by Senator Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts.  He tended to focus on the wording of the Constitution and literal interpretations of the provisions for establishment of new states.  Otis claimed it should not be debatable because, the earliest exercise of your authority over the domain ceded to the US was manifested in a solemn protest against the introduction of slavery into it (Raleigh).'  Many other Northerners took a softer line on the issue, hoping to compromise and restrict slavery incompletely. &lt;br /&gt;Virginian George Tucker spoke before the House of Representatives on February 25, and his stance on slavery in Missouri aligned with Pinckney's.  Tucker claimed that to restrict slavery would lead to skewed proportions of blacks and whites in the population, pushing whites to abandon territories and human labor to decline in value.  In the interest of preserving the Union, Tucker said that the government cannot possibly restrict slavery, and the North was confusing political and moral rules to justify calling slavery evil.  &lt;br /&gt;In a defense of the sectional interests of the nation he claimed to be embodied in the Constitution, Pinckney argued in return that the federal government could not take away the Southern way of life nor their valuable property.

At the time, the nation held a balance of eleven slave and eleven free states, and although Missourians were undivided in their desire for unrestricted slavery, implementing such a system in a new state could cause bitter conflict.  Representatives from all over the nation had an opinion on the Missouri issue. &lt;br /&gt;In February, 1819, Representative Tallmadge introduced an amendment providing for a gradual end to slavery in Missouri, but this was quickly rejected.  From January to March of 1820, Congressman John Taylor worked on another amendment to completely exclude slavery from the new state, substituting a provision leaving the apportionment to the general assembly of the territory, according to the free population thereof (Alexandria).'  On the other side of the coin, a common argument for the protection/expansion of slavery was based in the traditions of the conservative South.  In a Senate debate, Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina asked, why depart from the good old way, which has kept us in quiet, peace, and harmony;why leave the road of experience, which has satisfied all;to take this new way, which leads to universal emancipation, of which we have no experience (Raleigh)?'&lt;br /&gt;After months of deliberation and modifications, the final House bill was based on the Thomas Amendment, limiting the area of expansion of slavery and prohibiting slavery north of the 36? 30' line excepting Missouri.

The slave, Davy, was described in the Southern Recorder as a 25-30 year old man, about 5'10' tall, with a well made, round face, with tolerable large whiskers.'  Betton, the owner, surmised that Davy ran for Augusta, Georgia , his hometown , and that because he was handy with the razor and scissors,' he might try to pass as a freeman working in a barbershop.  Betton offered a 25 dollar reward to anyone who could capture Davy.  &lt;br /&gt;Although Betton revealed the human nature of his slave by describing his probable thought process and plan of action, his written attitude treated the escapee as an object, a possession.  This posting is reflective of the notion of chattel' slavery, defining owned laborers as property, which had been legally recognized by the United Stated since 1650.

The writer used primary evidence to make the argument that those who criticized Southerners for upholding the institution of slavery were hypocritical because many of them made money from illegal importation of slaves overseas, the act that produced this servitude (Alexandria).'  The transportation and selling of slaves from West Africa, or any other country, was officially outlawed in 1808 as a response to Northern persistence.  Nevertheless, between that time and 1860, the South illegally imported over 250,000 slaves.  &lt;br /&gt;This crime had become a major topic of controversy, especially earlier in the year in which the Herald published its article.  On January 7, 1820, the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, submitted a letter to the House of Representatives regarding any and all information he had on the introduction of slaves into the United States.  The US government required copies of communication about bringing slaves into the country since 1816.  Thompson's letter contained a few short letters he received about suspicious activity on the seas, as well as instructions he had sent in January, 1819, to all the commanding naval officers to make them aware of the illicit activity.  &lt;br /&gt;The Alexandria Herald correctly pointed out that though Northerners began to abolish slavery within their borders and speak out against the institution, it was frequently the shippers and merchants from those same states who engaged in the slave trade.  The moral ideals of the North were undermined by the economic mindset of these traders, looking to profit from illegal slave imports for the South.  The newspaper backed its accusation by reporting a recent capture of a Rhode Island schooner with a full cargo of slaves.

On June 17, 1820, England was appointed by Pope Pius VII as bishop of the new diocese centered in Charleston, SC.  He did not receive word of this decision until July 10, when he read the news in a letter from Reverend Henry Hughes.  England was asked to accept the position and travel to America as soon as possible, becoming the first bishop in a diocese consisting of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, with a Catholic population of about 5,000.  England described the process of arranging for his appointment and his holy consecration, on September 21st, in his diurnal, or personal notebook.  &lt;br /&gt;Reverend England became bishop during a time of significant growth in the American Catholic Church, though persecution of this minority group certainly existed.  Many nativist Southerners attacked his faith, and in response he established the first Catholic newspaper in the United States.  First published in 1822, England's newspaper influenced and strengthened Catholic thought in other parts of the nation.  Within his diocese, England instituted a system of conventions to support the need for continuity between contemporary issues and Catholic tradition.  The major reform involved with this system gave significant governing roles to the laity, but his ideas did not live on after his administration.  &lt;br /&gt; John England greatly contributed to the sense of collegiality of the bishops, but he is also known for his public stance on slavery.  Not a single American Catholic bishop before the Civil War spoke for abolition, and England was no different.  He argued that although the trade in slaves was wrong, no pope had ever condemned domestic slavery.  Bishop England had declared that he was not friendly to the existence or continuation of slavery,' but in the end he used examples from scripture and Christian tradition to defend the institution."],"display_date":"June 17, 1820","search_date":"1820-06-17","locations":[{"id":11453,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1215,"title":"Missouri Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-06-12","end_date":"1820-07-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Southerners wasted no time after the completion of the Missouri Compromise to create a sound structure of government for the newest slave state.  The 1820 Convention to establish guidelines for Missouri statehood consisted of 41 delegates, all but eight of whom were born in slave states or territories.  The convention was organized with David Barton as president, William G. Pettus as secretary, and four groups that would submit their efforts to a central committee to be combined into a single document.  &lt;br /&gt;The Convention borrowed extensively from Kentucky's Second Constitution of 1800 on the issue of slavery, which Missourians almost unanimously viewed to be a basic property right.  Also, the proslavery convention reflected the economic interests of these Southerners, who had most of their capital invested in land and slaves.  An interesting but not uncommon feature of the new constitution was that the delegates put it into effect without waiting for Congressional approval or to take a popular vote.  This did not seem to pose a problem because, for the most part, the laws under which the Missouri Territory had been operating would remain enforced unless revoked by the General Assembly.  &lt;br /&gt;At the conclusion of the convention, general and Congressional elections were set to take place in August.  Alexander McNair was chosen governor by a large margin over William Clark.  William Ashley became lieutenant governor and John Scott was elected as representative to Congress.  In a November 16 session of Congress, Scott presented a copy of the Missouri Constitution as it stood after the Convention.  It was only at this time that the written structure for the new state was referred to a select committee (Journal)' of three Maryland Congressmen for review."],"display_date":"June 12, 1820 - July 19, 1820","search_date":"1820-06-30","locations":[{"id":7914,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1261,"title":"Newspapers used as a medium\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-06-08","end_date":"1860-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Advertisements for the sale and purchase of African-Americans were found daily in local newspapers.

Advertisements placed in newspapers, such as The Nashville Union and American, ran ads that were focused on hiring extra slave labor to be used in industrial factory work.

After much consideration, Governor Adams took Bunch's argument to the South Carolina Legislature.  In his message to the session of 1855, Adams advised that it was better to be kind to colored people,' free colored people, by allowing colored seamen of foreign ships to remain on board and not be subject imprisonment.  He advised that this would make them less inclined to denounce the institution of slavery, and that the colored hireling who may visit us will see much in their [slaves] condition to envy.'

Much of this began to be blamed upon the northern states, such as Massachusetts, who was not upholding the Fugitive Slave Act.  There was a southern anticipation regarding the northerners' influence on the escape and uprisings of slaves.  A large part of this view that northern abolitionists were involved was because of the Underground Railroad.  Activity of the Underground Railroad was more common in the Border States, such as Virginia, and even in the farther state of Delaware, which was surrounded by anti-slavery states.  This loss of slaves was attributed to slave stealing.&lt;br /&gt;In November 1855, the Richmond Dispatch reported that there are undoubtedly abolitionist agents in all of Virginia.'  The common disappearance of slaves led to a desire to further strengthen any laws against slaves and those who help them escape, which would include the northern abolitionists who steal' slaves away to the north.

There was an attempt to curb the movement and loss of slaves, therefore the laws were made stricter with to disillusion anyone into helping escaped slaves.

After review, the members submitted the constitution to the convention of delegates, ratified, and ultimately passed it under the provisional government. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;          Key changes appeared in the Confederate Constitution.

Although it protected domestic slavery, the Confederate Constitution prohibited the importation of slaves from any foreign countries that were not territories of the United States.

One of the problems that arose from this situation involved the Platte County, Missouri, which, according to the Times-Picayune, some desired to be annexed to Kansas by pro-slavery factions on the border between Missouri and Kansas.  This heightened tensions between the pro-slavery and free-soil groups near that area.&lt;br /&gt;A land dispute led to the shooting of free-soiler Charles Dow by pro-slavery Franklin N. Coleman.  As the Nashville Union and American quotes from the Courier, this dispute began when three Abolitionists went to the home of Mr. Coleman and ordered him to leave.  He retrieved a weapon, and when one of the Abolitionists shot at Coleman, he shot the man dead.  Coleman gave himself up for trial, but, while he was gone, a mob of abolitionists drove Coleman's wife and children out of their home, setting fire to his property along with the homes of 15 other pro-slavery families in the area. This erupted into a larger conflict when the sheriff of Missouri arrested Lawrence, a friend of Dow's, on the charge of conspiring to retaliate against Coleman, as many of his comrades had already done by burning.  Deputy Marshal Jones arrested Dow, but the free-soilers gathered in a strong force, trying to coerce his release.  The militia had to be ordered by the Governor to ensure order in the area of Lecompton.   The Deputy ended up with a large group of pro-slavery Missourians behind him, with the intent of offering their services to the Governor to aid in maintaining the laws.' &lt;br /&gt;According to the Richmond Dispatch, the forces from Missouri were know as the Platte Riffle Company, and they marched up to meet up in Franklin with pro-slavery factions from Wakarusa and Westport.

After long debates and delays, the convention voted 61 to 39 in favor of secession.  White Alabamans felt threatened by the North and the Republican Party.

The Baton Rouge Gazette reports on January 30, 1830, that on Saturday night last about 10 o'clock Mr. John Whitten was killed by one of his own slaves, by a discharge from a musket loaded with buckshot.' Events such as this, an actual murder by a slave were extremely rare in the slave South, and when they did occur were a shock to the community and caused a great deal of anxiety and often conspiracy theories about slave uprisings -- such as fear of events like what became known as Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. As to Gazette writes when we see such outrages committed by negroes of the country, what have we not to fear from the strange negroes who are introduced every day into the State of Louisiana?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far more likely than the outright murder of his or her master was that a slave would simply run away, whether it be in an attempt to get to the North or just to a secluded local area. Southern newspapers, then, are littered with advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves as well as notices of captured runaways and where they are being held. The Richmond Enquirer, for example, lists on April 16, 1830, on a single page three different rewards for runaways and three notices of a captured slave being held in the local jail. The Raleigh Regsiter, on March 25, 1830, includes an ad entitled Notice. Twenty Dollar Reward. Ran away from the subscriber on the 10th of February.' Interestingly, here the ad describes the runaway as a white slave,' referring to his skin tone, perhaps meaning he had a white parent or grandparent. All of these ads, however, list a brief description of the runaway as well as the name given by his or her master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, sometimes the unthinkable did occur and a slave struck back. The aftermath, however, is important because it is designed to establish a sense of justice in the eyes of white slave owners, and to reassure them about the continuity of a stable slave society. Zac, for example, the slave convicted of murdering John Whitten, was described as his master's favorite,' and he confessed that he alone was guilty.' Thus, to white society this was a single act by what was likely a deranged individual.

It is no wonder, therefore, that in what is still primarily a slave-based economy, especially in the South, Americans began to wonder what to do with this growing free black population. After all, how could formerly enslaved blacks fit into white society when President Andrew Jackson had declared that even the recognizably free Indian tribes were no better than savage hunters' with rude institutions' in a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a number of options available to whites as to what to do with freed blacks. For starters, Henry Brawner of Maryland chaired a commission that encouraged all free blacks be deported from the state immediately upon becoming emancipated, and similar ideas showed in other states at various times. One of the most popular ideas at the time, however, was Recolonization' of blacks back to Africa. In an address to the American Colonization Society, reprinted in the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser on January 14, 1830, Henry Clay argues that as the two races progressively multiply and augment the source of supply of labor, its wages will diminish, and the preference already noticed will be given of free to slave labor.' As a result, he says, pinched by want, and neglected by their masters;. (slaves) would be stimulated to the commission of crimes' or potentially to rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, many white Americans urged free blacks to emigrate back to Africa. Specifically, on March 25, 1830, an advertisement in the Raleigh Register offered immediate information' to any free blacks desirous of accepting the opportunity thus offered of joining the settlement of free persons of color at Liberia.' However, recolonization to Liberia was not the only option for free blacks. A number of Northern states were beginning to tolerate, if not openly accept, the growing free black population -- including, for example, Northern Maryland and especially Baltimore which had a large number of free black residents. Finally, there was an African colony in Canada, the destination of many runaway slaves, which as the Baltimore American reported on January 14, 1830, amounted to about 2000' persons. Overall, however, most whites simply did not want free blacks living in their community; especially Southern whites to whom free blacks, and especially successful free blacks, represented a direct contradiction to an economic system and a way of life based on racial inferiorities."],"display_date":"January 14, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-14","locations":[{"id":4823,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1555,"title":"Texas State Consitutional Convention Votes to Abolish Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-02-27","end_date":"1866-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 27, 1866, the Texas Constitutional Convention decided to ban slavery in their new state Constitution.

Hamilton had been appointed provisional governor of Texas by President Johnson and was responsible for making sure that Reconstruction occurred defending the rights of African-Americans. &lt;br /&gt;On February 10, 1866, Governor Hamilton sent a message to the convention detailing the changes needed and reminding them that, No one can doubt...that such changes will be made in the organic law of the State as will make it conform in its spirit and principles to the actual changes that attended the progress of the late war and followed the overthrow of the rebellion.' The secession ordinance was declared null and void. Texas repudiated the public debt incurred during the war, and recognized the thirteenth amendment. The chairman of the Constitutional convention was Oran M. Roberts, who served as a delegate despite the fact that he was an ex-confederate officer not yet pardoned by the President.  Delegate Roberts hoped that Texas would adopt, a white man's government' that would keep Sambo away from the polls.' His goals became a reality as the convention passed the Constitution with a literacy requirement for those wanting to vote. The Texas Constitutional Convention displayed the unwillingness of many Southern states to submissively adhere to the orders of their Commander in Chief. Their passage of the initiative banning slavery and their subsequent enactment of literacy requirements for voters exhibited their reluctance to abandon their traditional social structure and way of life."],"display_date":"February 27, 1866","search_date":"1866-02-27","locations":[{"id":12517,"lat":29.9115260515,"lng":-96.1773201162,"zoom":9,"place":"AUSTIN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1679,"title":"The Brig Nautius Sets Sail for African Colony\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-01-23","end_date":"1821-01-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Brig Nautius captained by a Capt.

Liberally interpreting his ambiguous instructions, Jackson led his troops deep into areas of Florida under Spanish control, capturing two Spanish forts. Because Florida held the potential of becoming a new slave state, southern congressmen eagerly backed Jackson's plans.  In addition to securing greater protection for American settlements, the mission helped to expose the vulnerability of Spanish rule in Florida. Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, used that vulnerability to pressure Spain into selling Florida to the United States, and after ratification of the Adams-Onis treaty outlining the conditions of the purchase and drawing territorial boundaries for the remaining Spanish holdings in North America, the U.S. government purchased Florida in February of 1821 for five million U.S. dollars, all of which was paid directly to U.S. citizens with claims against the Spanish government.  General Jackson was appointed Military Governor of the Territory in March, and resigned in December of the same year. Florida was not signed into statehood until March 3, 1845 during the Presidential term of John Tyler. ","During the later years of the eighteenth century and start of the nineteenth century, Spanish Florida saw an onslaught of immigration from U.S. states due to attractive land grants and because it was seen as a safe haven for escaped slaves seeking refuge from U.S. laws binding them to harsh masters and conditions in the southern plantation states.  Though runaway slaves viewed Florida as a place to find freedom, slave traders considered Florida an ideal place of business.  Although in 1808 the U.S. passed laws prohibiting the importation of African slaves, because Florida was still under Spanish rule and in combination with its abundance of coastline, slave traders brought African slaves into Florida and then smuggled them into Georgia to be sold to plantation owners.  The Florida slave trade continued even after the United States took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1821.  Plantation owners began to immigrate to Florida, bringing their slaves with them, and the population of Florida more that quadrupled between the years of 1830 and 1860.  However, the population of free blacks barely increased.

His presidency encompassed what came to be called the Era of Good Feelings.'  The largest political crisis Monroe faced while in office came toward the end of his first term, when the question of slavery shrouding the entrance of Missouri to the Union threatened to disrupt the legislative balance between North and South. Congress was able to keep the peace by negotiating a compromise in which Massachusetts allowed its northernmost counties to apply for admission to the Union as the new free state of Maine, while Missouri was to be admitted as a slaveholding state. The compromise also called for the prohibition of slavery in the western territories of the Louisiana Purchase above the 36/30' line.  In his second inaugural address, domestic concerns pertained mostly to westward expansion and race relations amongst whites and Native-Americans; however, he made no mention of the expansion of slavery or his opinion on the issue.  His presidency encompassed what came to be called the Era of Good Feelings.' ","One of his lasting achievements was the Monroe Doctrine, which became a major tenet of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere.   As evidenced in his second inaugural address, domestic concerns of expansion overlapped with concerns of foreign interference upon that expansion, which directly influenced Monroe's administration in developing what became popularly referred to as the Monroe Doctrine, sent to congress in December of 1823.  With the words and advice of John Quincy Adams, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, the doctrine aimed to warn European powers against seeking further colonization in North America, the bulk of which rhetoric was directed toward Russia's growing interest in acquiring California from the dissolving Spanish colonial land holdings. The message contained, in the first place, a clause directed against Russia: The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. Against intervention there was even a stronger protest: With the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it; we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power, in any other light than as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. The international news of the doctrine caused an immediate rise in the funds of the States in European markets and all projects of European intervention were at once abandoned.  In 1824 Russia made a treaty agreeing to claim no territory south of 54 degrees 40', and not to disturb or restrain citizens of the United States in any part of the Pacific Ocean.' When Monroe retired from the Presidency on March 4, 1825, the national government's internal authority had steadily increased throughout the previous decade, and the influence of the United States on international affairs proved that the nation had become one of the world's great powers."],"display_date":"March 5, 1821","search_date":"1821-03-05","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1694,"title":"Supreme Court Decision on the Amistad Case\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-03-09","end_date":"1841-03-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story ruled that the Amistad Africans were free men and had never been enslaved under Spanish law.

Although, initially careful of what stance to openly announce on the issue of Texas, Clay publicized his negative feelings on the issue of Texas annexing the United States. Due to the second party system in 1844, which allowed for party loyalty to switch regardless of self-interest, Clay now feared the consequences of his shared opinion. Clay worried that southern Whigs may defect to the Democrats. Clay knew that if Southern Whigs viewed the prospect of Texas above their party loyalty, his chances of succeeding in the presidential elections were slim.

She was taken from her mother and lived in the Dickson Household. Here she was given privileges uncommon to most slaves, and it was during this time she learned to read and write.

A controversy over the degree to which slave populations could determine seats in the General Assembly precipitated this call for change; under the current constitution, the western part of the state felt that the eastern part was overrepresented because it had more slaves and slave owners than the west. The convention opened on October 14, 1850 and met for almost a year. On August 1, 1851, the convention had finally drafted a new constitution and published copies for distribution to the citizens of Virginia. The voting public was set to ratify the document in an election on Thursday, October 23, 1851.  The citizens of the Commonwealth approved, and the new General Assembly met for the first time in Richmond on Monday, January 12, 1852, under the new constitution.&lt;br /&gt;The new Virginia constitution had many passages specifically about slavery.   It said that freed slaves who stayed in Virginia longer than 12 months from the date of their emancipation would be returned to their former slave status (IV.19).   The powers of the General Assembly regarding slaves were very specific.  The constitution gave it the power to restrict slave owners' ability to emancipate their own slaves, and could pass laws to relieve the Commonwealth of free blacks (IV.20).   Additionally, the General Assembly was denied the ability to emancipate slaves or descendants of slaves, before or after their birth (IV.21).   While property other than slaves was simply taxed in proportion to value, the new constitution contained special rules for the taxation of slaves.   Slaves 12 years and older were taxed in the same manner as land 300 in value.   Slaves less than 12 years old were not taxed (IV.23).   The additional mention of slavery in the new constitution was in IV.36, which provided for the records of births, deaths, and marriages of whites, as well as the births and deaths of colored persons,' distinguishing between free and slave.   Additional changes include universal white male suffrage; landholding restrictions were eliminated .

It stated that the executive government would enforce the freedom of the slaves and that no conducts of repression toward their freedom would be tolerated.  The Proclamation further cited that all slaves who escaped and took refuge within the military lines would be considered captives of war and forever free. Lincoln also revealed his intent of providing compensation for the slaves. &lt;br /&gt;Lincoln's Proclamation stressed that the South must rejoin the Union, or that they would face the loss of all their slaves.

He stated that, Any lying negro who felt disposed to do so could involve in the most serious difficulties of the first men in the land;Excellent and worthy citizens were stripped of poverty and otherwise shamefully treated (by the Yankees) upon the testimony of some unprincipled slave,' (Hardwick/Hofstra, pg 286).   This description by Turner reveals the great disruption and disorder that the Civil War brought to the South within the social classes and slave system.  It also exposes a turning of the tables due to the greater empowerment that slaves began to receive.  &lt;br /&gt;A diary by Fannie Page Hume, a twenty-four year old woman living in Orange Virginia, demonstrated the turmoil and suffering that everyday citizen's faced. Fannie first recalled the terrible fear that struck their household in July when hearing of the Yankees presence in a nearby county.  She related her experience of being on constant edge and of her and her family spending many sleepless nights.  The Yankees raided their meat-house to Fannie's great fury.  The Yankees left the following day, but Fannie and her family receive many other alarms of their possible return. Fannie constantly refers to how much things have changed, particularly the Sunday Sabbaths, and how she wishes things could return to the good old times.  She spends her birthday during these anxious months, God grant my next birthday may witness more peaceful scenes- what may I not have to encounter , ere then- have made no resolutions, thoughts too tumultuous for that- I only ask for the hour of trial,' (Hume, pg 68).  The Yankees return again, raising an attack on their village. Fannie describes the night as sickening as blood was flying in all directions.  She helps out in caring for the wounded as much as she can.  Many residents' of Orange lost everything and moved away to a safer place, as did Fannie's cousins. &lt;br /&gt;These two accounts demonstrate the great disruptions the Civil war brought to people's lives.

He wanted niggers. In particular, he wanted the ability to hire an overseer, to raise himself to a higher class distinction. Some of his hunting buddies had overseers, and their constant dialogue about plantation life left Keen on the outside. He wanted nothing more in life than a plantation of niggers so I could talk about my overseer. Keen decided he would marry a rich, old widow to fulfill his slaveholding aspirations.","His first matrimonial expedition failed miserably. He found no rich widows waiting for him, and, in fact, he actually fell in love with one of the prettiest girls I ever saw in my life. Her name was Martha Hooker, but she was 16 and poor; she offered no hope of a suitable dowry to hire an overseer off of. Love was just a mere distraction to Keen. Over the next few weeks he began to write to a widow who filled the bill, but only received silence in return. Frustrated, he obtained a letter of introduction and set out to call upon the old lady. Her name was Rhoda Dean, and her youngest of nine children was 26. Keen was only 22. On his first visit, Keen got straight to the point, for he was never favorably impressed with long courtships; would she marry him? The answer took a few minutes but she consented. Numbers raced through Keen's head, for Rhoda Dean's estate was valued at seventy five thousand dollars. He could finally hire the overseer of his dreams and more slaves to accompany him. As Historian Walter Johnson might say, George Keen was constructing himself out of slaves, literally. Keen saw his value as a man in the amount of slaves he owned and if that amount qualified him to hire an overseer. He was affectionately called a Florida cracker, a plain folk white with little or no slaves. For Keen and other pioneers, he viewed his station as temporary. Non-slaveholding status preceded slaveholding without an overseer which preceded planter status. Each step Keen took in Columbia County brought him closer to the pinnacle, to manhood, and to conversing with his hunting buddies about their overseers.","Slaves were southern symbols of masculinity and whiteness, but they were also literal commodities and property. The ownership of property lay at the foundation of southern society and stood as a barrier to participation within that network. Political involvement, economic leverage, and social interaction hinged upon the amount of property possessed, and Keen knew this very well. He saw numbers everywhere. The widow was worth 75,000 dollars, and Keen himself was worth 4,000 dollars in niggers, land, cattle, horses, and money. Free blacks on Virginia's Eastern Shore in the seventeenth century were able to interact with patrons and have legal standing before the court because they leased, then owned, land tracts and raised cattle. As the South moved westward and into Florida, the frontier communities that developed were full of men like George Keen, ambitious, industrious men seeking opportunity in a society still forming. To progress upward in the hierarchy, Keen was willing to do anything, even marry a widow three times his age."],"display_date":1847,"search_date":"1847-07-02","locations":[{"id":1311,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"COLUMBIA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1958,"title":"The Observer&#39;s Slave Clothing Debate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-09-17","end_date":"1835-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Elijah Lovejoy, a staunch abolitionist living in Missouri, published and owned the St. Louis Observer. As part of his weekly papers, Lovejoy printed national and international news on a variety of subjects, most frequently the debate on slavery. Lovejoy printed one of these hotly debated articles on September 17, 1835, when Asa A. Stone's editorial article on the clothing condition of slaves in the South appeared in the Observer. Stone claimed that blacks' absence of clothing was a function of slave choice and low intelligence, not the poor treatment slaves received. The article angered free black supporters and abolitionists alike in Missouri and fueled further efforts of abolitionists who worked to erase the misconceptions printed by pro-slavery advocates."," This fight over slave conditions took on a fervent religious tone that highlighted the basic equalities of man, regardless of skin color. Lovejoy and his abolitionist publishing staff inserted an interesting caveat that preceded Stone's editorial. That the Christian slave-holders-at least so many of them as read the Observer-we only ask of every brother, when about to complete the bargain with the negro-driver...Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even to them for this is the law and the prophets. "," When Stone wrote that Thousands of Creole slaves of Louisiana do go naked, from choice, in the summer time...it is a common, I must say general practice to raise children without any clothing whatever, either in summer or winter, he failed to realize that many of these slaves did not wear clothes for reasons other than their inherent primitiveness. Often, economic conditions of black and white alike dictated what was available. On poor white farms and small plantations, the availability of fabric was limited only to white households. Hannah Jones, a former slave, recounted that for blacks without any source of income or education, it was impossible to gain fabric to clothe a family. As Jones' told of her experience, Old Marse Ben died and after dat Tom carried us all back down der to New Orleans wid him and opened up a n*r pen. Dat's a place like a stock yard where dey auction us off. We only know our ages by known' we is born in corn plantin' and cotton pickin' time. We never even knowed de days of de week. "," Many times, slaves only received new clothing when sold by slave traders. As Walter Johnson notes, future jobs slaves were to perform dictated clothing; future field hands dressed in far fewer and shabbier clothing than hotel workers or household workers. Often in addition, clothing covered up scars and illnesses in the marketplace, so nakedness was desirable in commodities sales. For slaves with particularly cruel masters, the scars left from whippings were often very visible. Another slave, Henry Johnson said, In de start de slave has been stripped naked, and lashed, often to death. Dey would be left strapped after from twenty-five to fifty lashes every two or three hours to stand dere all night...I never knowed what a shirt was until I was past twenty. "," The situation in which blacks lived in the South-for most, not of their own volition-sparked not only distaste of slaveholders, as Johnson notes, but the slave traders as well. Stone's editorial in the Observer brought further national debate on the premise of white superiority over blacks, especially in the South. The basic need for clothing ignored by slave owners, whether out of cruelty or poor economic success, could not be further avoided; even Stone himself stated that he could not comment on the debasing influence of a system that can produce such a state of things."],"display_date":"September 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-17","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1961,"title":"By-law Implemented for Gun Control \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-03-25","end_date":"1824-03-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Mayor and Common Council of Annapolis declared a by-law to prevent the firing of guns within the city limits. The Mayor first informed the citizens of Annapolis on the by-law in an article published in the local paper, <em>The Maryland Gazette</em>, on March 25, 1824. The article permitted a week long period of time for news of the by-law to reach the people of Annapolis before the Common Council planned to implement it within the city limits. Under this by-law, any person found guilty of firing or discharging a gun within city limits except when performing military duty, shall be fined a sum no less than one or more than five dollars. In addition, this by-law declared that any person found guilty of carrying a gun uncovered through any of the streets, lanes or alley of this city shall be viable to a fine of one dollar."," In 1824, guns tended to be tools, luxury items, or broken relics. According to historian Jan E. Dizard, the people around Annapolis had to rely on blacksmiths to make repairs to their guns, since most areas lacked gunsmiths. Blacksmith most often had little knowledge of guns, and did not know how to make proper repairs. The overwhelming majority of guns tended to be poorly cared for, and passed from generation to generation."," The Annapolis by-law established that if any person offending against the provision of this by law shall be a slave and the owner or employer shall not elect to pay the penalty inflicted then another punishment will be in order, as long as it does not exceed thirty nine lashes or ten days imprisonment. Historian Dizard claims that in the nineteenth century, guns were mostly made of iron, and in order to prevent them from rusting they required constant attention. Thus, unless people of the Annapolis area had servants who constantly cared for their guns, they rarely brought a gun out with them. Any slaves within Annapolis city limits with possession of a fire-arm most likely had masters that put them in charge of caring for their guns. The Annapolis by-law presumably affected the relationship between slaves and their owners. With the implementation of the by-law, slave owners hesitated to entrust their slaves with care of their weapons. Slave owners feared that punishment of their slaves would have an effect on their own reputation among the people of Annapolis. No master wanted to be viewed as a man who could not keep his slaves under control. In addition, if a slave received thirty nine lashes or ten days imprisonment this slowed down the productive capacity of a slave owner's property.

Jeffery and A. Alt advertised the sale of aromatic snuff in the <em>American Beacon and Commercial Daily</em> on June, 27 1817 in Norfolk, Virginia. Jonathon P. Whitwell prepared and bottled the aromatic snuff in Boston. Whitwell shipped the snuff to Norfolk and various other locations across the East coast. Jeffery and Alt sold the aromatic snuff to Virginians who desired to fill their medicine chests in order to gain self-sufficiency in medical care. "," According to Catharine C. Hopely, a tutor at Forest Hill near Tappahannock County in 1815, a capacious medicine chest is an inseparable part of a Southern establishment; and I have seen medicines enough dispensed to furnish good occupation for an assistant when colds or epidemics have prevailed. Virginians frequently resorted to home-remedies due to the inaccessibility of many farms to main highways, good roads and means to speedy transportation that prevented them from reaching physicians. Thus, Virginians on plantations, farms, and even urban households desired self-sufficiency in medical care. The desire for self-sufficiency stemmed from the economics of slave holding that instructed masters to do everything possible to keep their slave force healthy."," When caring for slaves, if a combination of drugs or particular medication arrested symptoms, slave owners used that treatment until a better one came along. According to historian Todd L. Savitt, plantation overseers and owners recorded useful medical recipes and clipped suggestion from newspapers into their journals. Most homes possessed a medical digest in addition to a well stocked medicine chest. Many Virginians owned <em>Simon's Planters Guideand Family book of Medicine </em> or <em>Ewell's Medical Companion</em>. Digests presented specific instructions on the treatment of many disease, the proper dosages of drugs for each age group, and the best uses for most medicine."," Historian Stephanie P. Browner claims that slaves frequently treated their diseases or illnesses themselves without their master's knowledge. Slaves did this for several reasons; to offset the failures and harshness of white remedies or the negligence of masters, and most often to exert some control over their own lives. Black home remedies secretly circulated throughout slave quarters, and elders passed them down to younger generations. According to Browner, some medicines contained ingredients that had purely superstitious values, but slaves mainly obtained cures from local plants. Occasionally, whites learned of an effective treatment that slaves used, and adopted it for themselves. However, this did not affect the business of Jeffery and Alt who traveled around Virginia and sold medicine to Virginians who desired to fill their medicine chests with a large assortment of remedies."," Slaves represented a financial investment that required protection, and it made enormous sense for masters to maintain the health of their slaves. Awareness that certain illnesses could easily spread to a master's own families if not properly treated became a strong incentive for masters to keep their slaves healthy. A sick and physically incapacitated slave could not work, and represented a financial loss. The economics of slave holding instructed masters to do everything possible to keep their slave force healthy. This required masters to keep a well stocked medicine chest and adopt an assortment of home remedies.

Brown of Tennessee spoke at a benefit for an orphan's asylum in Nashville, Tennessee. During his speech at Odd Fellow's Hall, he addressed the recent progress of the United States in regarding the escalating question of slavery. Governor Brown expressed the feelings of many southerners who felt threatened by the anti-slavery rhetoric in the North. The Governor also vividly exposed the hypocrisy of northerners in their efforts to end slavery, yet contain the African American population to the South. ","Governor Brown first questioned the constitutionality of northern sentiment to alter the institution of slavery. He specifically referred to the three-fifths clause in the Constitution that compared a slave's status to that of the white man. Brown asked if the Connecticut of today was unwilling to stand to the compact ratified by the Connecticut of 1787? In the eyes of Governor Brown any breakdown or change within the Constitution would lead to the breakdown of the Union. The South wished to stand by the compact made in 1787, while the North, whether directly or indirectly, wanted to break it. The Governor realized how much northern communities feared the infiltration of African Americans. Throughout the South, African Americans lacked equality to whites and lived under brutal oppression. But African Americans lived directly along side whites on a day to day basis. Slave women participated in raising their master's children, and some slave men acted as overseers and managed important aspects of the plantations on which they lived. Northerners did not live in close quarters with African Americans. They did not embrace them as part of their families as did many southerners. Governor Brown exemplified this point to his audience at Odd Fellow's Hall. He declared that once the North ensured African American's their escape from bondage, where shall they go? Who will receive them? Will the North? Never"," Governor Brown acknowledged, like many other southerners, that northerners did not feel a moral obligation to end slavery. Northerners sought to end slavery in order to better provide for themselves. According to Frederick Law Olmsted, northerners did not detest slavery, it is simply the negro competition and the monopoly of the opportunities to make money by negroe owners. Governor Brown and his fellow southerners knew that northerners wanted nothing to do with freed slaves and the competition for cheap labor they might create with a mass migration to the North. Poor, non-slaveholding whites in the South reaffirmed this fear for northerners. Frederick Law Olmstead suggests that poor white people were usually far better off in the free states, than in the slave.

Months later, on Saturday, March 27, 1847, the Daily Union continued to run the advertisement. One of the slaves on Harrison?s plantation ran away, and Harrison entered a wanted ad in hopes of having him found and returned as soon as possible. In order to ensure the slaves safe return, master's like Harrison made thorough descriptions of their slaves in want ads. Historian Michael Mullin points out that whites identified ethnicity in three ways, appearance, patterns of scarification, and by dialect. In his wanted advertisement, Harrison described Harry as a young negro boy of around 18 years of age. Harry stood about five foot three inches tall with a black complexion. When he left Harrison's plantation he wore a mixed jeans frock coat, and a green blanket coat, and a palm leaf hat. Harrison believed that the boy traveled to the towns in which he had the closest relations: Gallatin and Lebanon."," The first line of Harrison's wanted advertisement stated the reward for the runaway in bold print. Landon Harrison offered 50 dollars reward for the return of Harry. He requested that if anyone found Harry, they needed to return him directly to the Nashville jail. From there, Landon Harrison would determine the reward by whether or not the capturer found Harry within the borders of the state. If captured within state lines, the reward stood at 25 dollars. If captured across state lines, the reward doubled to 50 dollars. Landon Harrison's reward was indicative of a slave's monetary worth. The further away an escaped slave managed to travel the less likely he is to be caught. Thus the monetary reward should be greater if someone captured Harry outside of the state. The slave master feared unoccupied, unsupervised slaves because of the cost they incurred when slaves escaped. Slaveholders knew the loss of investment that accompanied the loss of a slave."," Runaways who were returned to their owners received harsh punishment for attempting to escape. Michael Mullin gives one account of a master who bound, gagged, and left his slave to insects for running off. Sometimes, however, masters sold their runaways once someone found and returned them. Some masters did not want their other slaves to believe that they too could escape and get away with it. So instead, the master acted as though he made the decision to sell the slave in the first place.

Shapard wanted to sell his estate, and vividly described every aspect of it in his advertisement. The estate was not merely a house on a plot of land, but it was an elaborate and highly integrated plantation. W.B. Shapard recently finished constructing a new main building. Built of brick, the house contained nine rooms, two large passages with handsome stairways and was finished in the best of style. Besides the house itself, Shapard listed the many plantation amenities to be found on the estate. These included a kitchen, store rooms, smoke house, carriage house, negro houses, stable, cow houses, and a spring house. According to W.B. Shapard, his plantation typified a proper country residence. Shapard ornately described the intricate details of the interior of the main house and painted a picture of the countryside which surrounds it. In his advertisement, Shapard capitalized on the romanticism that accompanied the reputations of plantations through out the South. "," Plantations like Shapard's separated the middle region of Tennessee from the more mountainous regions in the east of Tennessee. To the east of Nashville, in places like Knox County, farms produced on a much lower scale than plantations in the middle region of Tennessee did. Farming families like the Gibb's of east Tennessee, produced grains, wool, and other food stuffs. They also raised several different types of livestock.

Farms surrounding Nashville and other regions of middle Tennessee produced tobacco in an amount that was four to six times greater than individual farms in other regions of Tennessee."," Plantations like W.B. Shapard's supported production of this magnitude. Running a plantation was in a sense like running a business. The difference became evident by the way plantation owners provided for their workers. Instead of receiving salaries, owners provided their slaves with food, clothing, and living quarters, such as those described by W.B. Shapard. Plantations like the one W.B.

Palmore, an attorney in Fayette County, Tennessee, wrote a letter to one of his colleagues. Attorney Edward Brown received the letter from Palmore in Ballsville, Virginia. Palmore boasted the supremacy of the state of Tennessee to the state of Virginia. I will say nothing about the fertility of our soil and other advantages afforded here to the young and enterprising, Palmore declared. He quickly transitioned into the matter he wished to discuss: the issue of the settlement of John Robinson's estate."," C.S. Palmore acted as the administrator of Robinson's estate. He discussed primarily the placement of John Robinson's negroes. Initially Palmore left them with a woman by the name of Miss Frances. Yet as Palmore specified, Robinson did not name Miss Frances as the legatee of the estate. By legatee Palmore meant beneficiary, or the person named in a will to receive part or all of the state. In fact, in his letter to attorney Edward Brown, Palmore acted concerned only with the need for the legatees to pay Miss Frances for her trouble and expense as caretaker of Robinson's slaves. He hoped that Brown could help him find the legatees, a family he finally referred to as the Merymans. Palmore proposed that Brown act as (his) agent in the matter and if the legatees apply for their negroes if they will pay all charges and will release me in your better judgment you may let them have them or if they will sell them to you it will meet my full and harty approbation."," John Robinson?s written will provided instructions for the delegation of all his estate. C.S. Palmore struggled and sought help on only the matter of the future of Robinson?s slaves. Although the woman he referred to in his writing seemed to willingly look after Robinson?s slaves, Palmore pointed out the imposition of this to Edward Brown. Miss Frances benefited only marginally if at all from keeping Robinson's slaves. He seemed to insinuate that the cost was more than she can afford. Palmore declared to Brown that Miss Frances' account for raising George (one of Robinson's slaves) up to the first of February 1845 was 66.73 dollars. "," Slaves like George could either be an asset or a liability in the South. Robinson?s slaves became a liability to Miss Frances and she could only profit from their sale. Bobby Lovett's <em>The African-American History of Nashville, Tennessee</em>, describes a similar exchange that was had with a slave named Frank. When Frank's owner died he was left to his heirs who promptly made plans to convert this asset into cash. Whether in Tennessee, Virginia, or elsewhere in the South, inherited slaves posed a problem to both executors and beneficiaries of estates. Slaves required housing, food, and clothing. Slaves possessed too great a value to just give up, but created a cost that some inheritors could not afford to bear."],"display_date":"March 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-03-01","locations":[{"id":11986,"lat":35.1984324227,"lng":-89.4156896322,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2014,"title":"Southern History Retold in the Late Nineteenth Century\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-05-04","end_date":"1888-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As Edmund Halsey reflected over the time he served in the Civil War, he grew disheartened and worried.  In 1884 Halsey was concerned that, as time passed, a disconnect would develop between Central Virginians and their ability to appreciate the reasons why the war veterans from their area risked their lives to defend the South in the Civil War.  In a letter written from Edmund Halsey to his brother Joseph Halsey of Orange County, Virginia on May 4, 1884, he recapitulated the two brothers' experiences in the Battle of the Wilderness, which took place in Spotsylvania County, Virginia.  Edmund Halsey reflected, It seems strange to think that so many years have passed since then, but when we think of the many who were living there - in the field and at home - and now few are left and those few so scattered and changed it seems like recalling scenes in the Revolution.  Central Virginians who discussed historical events during the latter portion of the nineteenth century had several motives for their attention to the past.  According to Edward Ayers in Southern Crossing, one of these motives included a desire to prevent older Virginians from forgetting and younger Virginians from never learning about the history of their predecessors.  ","A desire to offset negative perceptions of the area also motivated Central Virginia's to focus on the past.  Like Halsey, Central Virginians were interested in reconstructing the history of their particular families and communities so that future generations would appreciate the events and respect the people of the past.  On April 19, 1887, Reverend Horace E. Hayden wrote to Alfred L. Holladay of Prospect Hill, Virginia requesting information about the genealogy and military involvement of the Holladay family.  Hayden was preparing a volume entitled Virginia Genealogies.  Hayden commented on Holladay's contribution to his book as he proclaimed that Holladay's sketch of the Virginia matron, a quiet farmer's wife, would offset the slander of those who argued that Virginians were self confident but ignorant planters, necessarily only once removed from semi-civilization.  Hayden attempted to counter what he considered to be northerners' erroneous portrayals of white southerners by retelling the history of several prominent families from Central Virginia.  In 1888, the Fredericksburg paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed an article that countered the negative connotations of the area, such as being behind the times, by emphasizing the positive aspects of the city, such as its hospitable inhabitants and historical importance in the Civil War.","During the latter portion of the nineteenth century, interest in the dissemination of the history of the South was not limited to individuals, such as Halsey, or Virginia, but was, instead, a focus of people throughout the South.  Ayers discusses the fear of Civil War veterans in both Virginia and throughout the South that their descendants would either fail to understand or remember their elders' participation in the Civil War.  In <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>, Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra discuss southerners' effort to recast the history of the South in a positive light.  For instance, educators in the South portrayed slavery as an institution that benefited all those who were involved.  Particularly in the years following the Civil War, people from the South argued that enslaved blacks had led better lives than their free counterparts in the North.  Supporters of the South and its cause defended their honor through the recasting of history in the years following the Civil War."],"display_date":"May 4, 1884 - April 19, 1888","search_date":"1886-04-27","locations":[{"id":14131,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2020,"title":"Threat of Slave Rebellion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-24","end_date":"1841-07-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter to his father John C. Burruss on July 24, 1841, John W. Burruss asked, ...do we not dwell in constant danger, are we not standing, rather [lying] down - sleeping on a smothered - not extinguished - volcano? John W. Burruss was expressing his fear of slave revolt, a fear he shared with many southern plantation owners. In his letter Burruss described a discovered slave revolt in West Felicia Parish, Louisiana, not far from Burrus's own Mississippi plantation. An overseer had overheard slaves having a suspicious conversation in the fields. The slaves were whipped until they confessed to plotting an uprising and revealed the names of their co-conspirators. One of Burrus's slaves, Lewis Campbell, was accused of involvement in the conspiracy. Burrus seemed certain that Campbell was a key player in the development of the scheme. He assured his father that the proper authorities had taken Campbell and the other insurgents into custody."," Although the revolt was quashed, the community was left in a state of upheaval. After southern white citizens discovered news of the rebellion many immediately became aggressive, lashing out against their slaves, though not to the infliction of death. Burrus went on to note that the trial would take place in August. He remarked that though the turmoil surrounding this event would eventually calm, tensions would remain as plantation owners continued to feel the threat of revolution. Slavery had a strong presence throughout Mississippi, but it was particularly deep-rooted in the delta at this time. Whites had established plantations there long before the rest of the state. In territorial Mississippi, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, plantation owners viewed slavery as a necessary evil. Despite many restrictions on slaves, slave owners rarely enforced these strict regulations. However, attitudes toward slavery quickly began to shift. By the end of the 1830s, slavery was considered not only beneficial for the slaveholder, but also for the slave. The plantation system proved to be so profitable that plantation owners used any ideological means they could to justify slavery. In the 1830s the number of slaves in Mississippi grew exponentially. By 1840, there were more blacks than whites in the state. As attitudes toward slavery changed and the black population grew, slaveholders became increasingly frightened of revolt. "," A slave insurrection, such as the one John Burrus reported, not only threatened the lives of slave holders, but also their economic welfare and social power. The institution of slavery and the social system it created were essential to the wealth of the plantation owner. Southern whites had witnessed the violence against whites wrought by Nat Turner, a slave from Southampton, Virginia, in 1831. Other plots of revolt had also been discovered throughout the South. After these events slaveholders were continuously ready for slave rebellion. Knowing that he had everything to lose, Burrus surely feared that Lewis Campbell was another Nat Turner."],"display_date":"July 24, 1841","search_date":"1841-07-24","locations":[{"id":5781,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2021,"title":"Mass Slave Runaway from McIntosh, GA Plantation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Things were looking promising on Mr. Thomas' plantation, Peru, in 1850. He owned over 150 slaves and 15,000 acres, all of which produced great wealth in the form of cotton and other crops. Most of his slaves had been reared on his plantation alongside him and his son ten-year old son, Edward. Both father and son felt they were very good to their slaves and provided them with ample food, clothing, and housing. Their generosity was such that Master Thomas even allowed many of his slaves to own guns, boats, horses, and to raise their own crops to sell to others. The Thomas' felt they treated their slaves in a fatherly fashion and called them our people, feeling that the relations between master and slave could not have been better anywhere. Both masters and slaves even went to the same church on Sundays, although the enslaved people had to sit in the back and take Communion last. Young Master Edward felt particular kinship with some of the slaves, as he played with them and requested barbeques on the plantation that everyone enjoyed. In the eyes of the Thomas family, life could not have been better for everyone on the plantation during the planting time of 1850. ","However, this content feeling disappeared when the largest slave runaway in young Edward's memory occurred just before the crop planting of 1850. Immense amounts of cotton were due to be planted, and it was a time when the most hardworking slaves were needed. At this crucial time eight or ten of Mr. Thomas' best slaves ran away, along with several other slaves from neighboring plantations, numbering fifty or sixty in all. The whites in the neighborhood were very angry at the fact that the runaways fled to the woods and outlying areas, and were surviving by stealing crops and cattle at night. Mr. Thomas and Edward were most distressed because in addition to ruining the slave-crop ratio needed for the planting, when the slaves left they felt as if fifteen thousand dollars had taken wings to itself and gone. The neighborhood did not see the runaways as men trying to obtain their rightful freedom, but as outlaws and menaces that had to be caught. The neighbors searched on horseback and with hunting dogs, and actually saw the runaways steal a boat and flee further into the woods but could not stop them. After that, nothing more was heard of the runaways until the first of December. That night, they came back to the plantation, sought out young Edward, and told him to tell Master that they were come in here. Master Thomas did not proceed to beat them but instead said he wished them to hell and later hired them out to a railroad contractor for the rest of the winter.","The runaway from Peru Plantation was in no way an unprecedented event for Southern slave owners, and runaways occurred for various reasons across the South. The living conditions of Southern slaves varied. Many were driven from sunrise to sunset, beaten constantly, had little food and terrible housing, and were given virtually no free time. However, despite the harshness of the institution of slavery, some masters were more lenient. Many told themselves they had to be good to their slaves because they were obligated to watch out for them and care for them in a fatherly manner. Many owners in Georgia also gave their slaves rations of meat, instead of just meal and corn. Some, like Mr. Thomas, allowed the slaves free time, which many used to tend gardens and sell their crops, as the slaves on Peru plantation did. Many masters, such as Mr. Thomas did not require their slaves to work on the Sabbath. However, even when slaves were given some leniency, as they were on the Peru Plantation, their masters were foolish to believe that their slaves were satisfied and placated by their master's paternalism and provisions. ","One of the biggest outlets for slaves to express their dissatisfaction was to run away. When they hid out like the Peru slaves, and as many others did across the South, it hurt their masters monetarily and unsettled the white community. It reminded them that their slaves were not satisfied, even if it did not totally ruin their delusion of being good masters. Slaves that fled, often raided crops and joined with slaves from other plantations when running away. These characteristics of the McIntosh runaways were not unique. Another common factor in slave runaways is that the slaves often only left for a short amount of time and sometimes returned of their own accord as did Mr. Thomas' slaves. It was hard for slaves as far south as Georgia to make it all the way to a free state and it was also hard for them to hide in a community where people would recognize them. Often they returned to their masters' plantations and the most common form of punishment was either being beaten or sold. Mr. Thomas did this on a lesser scale by hiring them out for a season. However Mr. Thomas felt, it can be assumed he was surprised by the slaves running away since he thought they had such wonderful conditions and relations, but this was what most slaveholders across the South believed. The nature of the McIntosh runaway was typical and shared many trends with other slave runaways in the South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":2023,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC INTOSH, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2022,"title":"Private Beaufort Slave Sale\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Sometime prior to the first of January 1836, slaveholder Thomas Fuller must have checked his books or given some thought to his economic needs. Perhaps he wanted to make some money, maybe he was in debt and needed to get cash to pay back a lender, or he may have been foreclosing on a loan. All of these were common reasons for selling slaves in the South. Or, maybe Fuller was just trying to get certain slaves off his hands for unknown reasons. What we do know is that he put an ad in the January 1, 1836 edition of the <em>Charleston Mercury </em> offering twenty slaves for private sale. In this group there were ten field hands, six children from the ages of five to fourteen, two older women, and two infants, Anyone interested in buying these slaves was to apply to him, but Fuller was sure to add a comment at the bottom of the ad: If these Negroes are not sold before the middle of February next, they will be offered for sale at Public Auction in Charleston.","The selling of slaves, as in the case of Thomas Fuller, was a common practice throughout the South. Masters sold their slaves for many reasons, but no matter the reason, slaves were torn from their homes, friends, and often families. Private sales, such as Thomas Fuller's, constituted the majority of slave sales in the South. These sales were often from neighbor to neighbor, or at least between people who lived in the same general vicinity. During the history of American slavery it is estimated that about 1,320,000 slaves were sold locally, while about 666,00 were sold at public auction or in interstate trades. Thus, sales like Thomas Fuller's were not uncommon at all and were advertised daily in Southern newspapers. The selling of slaves emphasized the principle that slaves were truly seen as property and nothing more, as Fuller's ad revealed. He was selling two infants, who may or may not been sold with either of their parents. The six field hands may well have been married people or parents, and the children, ages five to fourteen, were most likely sold off to the highest buyer, whether they were they were siblings or not. Every single one of these people may have left behind loved ones and each may have gone to a separate buyer. That is not to say that white buyers never bought couples of families. Some felt pulled to do so as slaves used white paternalistic attitudes to their benefit, or because buyers felt that purchasing families lessened the chance that their slaves would run away. Also, some white buyers may have felt their conscience weigh on them when they made their purchases. It is not known whether Thomas Fuller's slaves were sold privately to a neighbor or sold at public auction, but many accounts show that being sold privately was much preferable to enduring sale on the auction block.","Public auctions became increasingly popular cross the South during the nineteenth century as more slaves were needed, especially for the extremely heavy labor in the Deep South. At public auctions slaves were often categorized and rated, broken down by color distinction and supposed ability to work in the field, the home, as skilled workers ect. The slaves were expected to make themselves sell-able to people they have never seen before. Spouses, lovers, families, and friends were not always placed on the block together and were often sold apart from one another. Many buyers were more interested in purchasing a certain type of slave to fulfill a certain type of work than they were in buying families (unless of course) it suited their buying needs or they felt particularly compassionate. By the mid nineteenth century, male slaves could sell for 1300 dollars or more, women for 1000 or more especially if they were likely-looking, teenagers sold for slightly less than women, and children for about half as much. Whatever his incentive for selling was, Thomas Fuller was likely to make a great sum of money. No matter where his slaves were sold, a private sale or public auction, one can only hope that they were sold to decent plantations and kept with their loved ones, although this was a fate many slaves in the South did not experience."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":11444,"lat":32.4068445137,"lng":-80.4452215468,"zoom":8,"place":"BEAUFORT, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2023,"title":"Slave Family Gets Smuggled to John Clark&#39;s Trader&#39;s Yard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1861, it was illegal for Missourian traders to sell slaves to slaveholders in a different state. That did not prevent Captain Tirrell from taking Mattie Jackson, her brother, and her sister away from their mother and putting them onto a boat headed to Memphis. However, before the boat left St. Louis, Union policemen stopped the boat and returned the young slaves to their master. The Union policemen took no further action. Mattie recalled, Their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves that go out of the city. Then two years later, seven men, four watchmen, and three traders, forced themselves into her home and put her family into a closed carriage. This carriage took them to a dilapidated prison where they spent the night. Mattie recalled that, [the] kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time [they] were before taken and returned. The family was transferred from one train car to another, until they finally arrived in Louisville where they were held at John Clark's trader's yard. The family was sold out separately, except [her] mother and little brother, who were sold together. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six weeks, and herself four.","Mattie's family was enslaved in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Missouri was considered a border state and ultimately remained a member of the Union. Historian Ira Berlin argues that President Lincoln promised to respect the property rights of slaveholders in border states in order to keep them in the Union. Thus, slavery remained legal in Missouri. As Mattie knew however, interstate slave trading was outlawed. Despite violating the law, Captain Tirrell smuggled Mattie and her family out of the state and sold them in Louisville. Many other slaves experienced similar incidents. Mattie noted considerable smuggling was done. Although Union soldiers protected some slaves from being sold to areas outside of Missouri, slave owners and traders who [pretended] Unionism successfully smuggled slaves out of the state. ","The Union soldiers were not the only people Captain Tirrell fooled while smuggling his slaves out of Missouri. Mattie stated that Captain Tirrell tricked and deceived her family before he forced them to the trader's yard. She recalled that Captain Tirrell's kindness, generosity, and approbation to the contemplated marriage was only a trap. Such lies and trickery were common among slave owners in the South. Historian Walter Johnson argues, Many sellers resorted to ingratiation, deceit, and coercion. Slaveholders told their slaves that they would not be traded and then sold those same slaves weeks - or even days - later. Other slave owners tricked their slaves into thinking they were going to attend an event, such as a party, at another plantation. Once the slaves got into the wagon, they were brought directly to slave traders.","Trickery and lies were just the beginning to Mattie's horrible experience. Mattie described how her family spent considerable time in John Clark's trader's yard before being sold to their new masters.

H.C. Bruce was a slave on one of these farms. Many years after the Civil War, Bruce reflected on his experiences as a slave and recorded them in a book. According to Bruce, slave owners in Brunswick believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life. About nine miles from his farm lived a slaveholder named V. Harper. Harper owned quite a number of slaves, including one particular family that was respected by whites and blacks alike for their moral worth and character. In 1858, one of the daughters in this family, who Bruce described as having clean character, discovered that she would soon become a mother. This girl had not yet married nor was she engaged to a man at that time. Rather than dishonor herself and her family by bearing a child without a husband, she walked two miles to reach the Missouri River, plunged herself into it and was drowned."," During his account of the girl, Bruce acknowledged that it [was] not known who led her from the paths of rectitude. He also admitted however, that there would occasionally be a black mother with a very light-colored child. Bruce's diction suggests the slave was impregnated by her master. At that time, slaves were not considered as people, but rather as property. As property, slave owners often treated their slaves as they wished. Historian Joshua Rothman suggests, sexual contact between masters and slaves specifically and whites and blacks generally was commonplace in Virginia and in all slaveholding states. Because relationships between masters and their slaves were common in the antebellum South, it was reasonable that Bruce suggested such a relationship between the girl and her master. "," There are a few reasons why the girl in Bruce's account would have had sexual relations with her master. It was not uncommon in the antebellum South for a master to rape a female slave. As Rothman argues, a black woman's body was her greatest vulnerability. Rape was an effective weapon that slaveholders used to physically and mentally degrade their slaves. It was also a means to assert a racial hierarchy. Second, there were some instances where a slave woman would exchange sexual relations for preferential treatment on the plantation. However, the fact that the nineteen-year old girl drowned herself suggests that she probably did not engage in a sexual relationship to obtain preferential treatment on the farm. "," Though rape was not uncommon between master and slave, Bruce made it clear that slaves considered the action an attack on their honor and morality. Bruce stated that the girl decided that death was preferable in her case to disgrace. Rothman argues that in the antebellum South, a woman's honor resided in her sexual purity. The girl in Bruce's account realized that her pregnancy would bring shame to herself and her family. Instead of giving birth to her master's child, the girl decided to kill herself. With this action, she attempted to salvage as much of her honor and morality as she could."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":7480,"lat":39.5145426187,"lng":-92.9626052094,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARITON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2036,"title":"Richest County in the Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-03","end_date":"1857-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Different cultures define wealth in very different ways. In the minds of the citizens of Dougherty County, Georgia in the late 1850s, they were very wealthy indeed. According to the South Carolina Times in January of 1857, this plantation county claimed to be the richest County in the Union, excepting those containing the great cities. As evidence, they cited the per capita average of nine slaves valued at 5,000, and 10,000 worth of land to work them on. On whole, the county possessed land valued at 1,781,887; 980,000 in city property; merchandise worth 125,000; 650,000 liquid cash; and most importantly, 2,280,912 in slaves. This value, totaling over 5.8 million, is roughly equivalent to 119 million in 2005 U.S. dollars.","While Dougherty gloated, others mocked this definition of wealth. The New York Daily Times, hearing of this boast from its correspondent in South Carolina, saw the calculation in a very different light. The Daily Times pointed out the dominating value of slaves, then argued that by valuing white laborers at the market rate for slaves, each New York county would be far richer than Dougherty. Further, with only 125,000 worth of merchandise in the county, hundreds of stores in New York had more valuable merchandise than the entire Georgia county.","     Dougherty would indubitably have a different story to tell in 1865. The Daily Times might have added that the land in Dougherty was valued so highly because the highly profitable plantation economy drove up land prices. Even without the toll that the war extracted through destroyed infrastructure, seized crops, and the loss of much of the male population, the end of slavery surely crippled the fortunes of nearly all of Dougherty's wealthy planters. With land similarly devalued and any Confederate currency useless, Dougherty County could hardly be the richest county in the Union.","     Dougherty demonstrates the massive wealth that planters could accumulate in antebellum Georgia, as well as their complete dependence on the continuation of slavery to guard their investment in human property. Historians have debated for decades over the profitability of slavery, often centering the discussion on the question of profitable for whom? For Dougherty planters, at least, who counted slaves as market goods, this agricultural system led to enormous wealth."],"display_date":"January 3, 1857","search_date":"1857-01-03","locations":[{"id":1744,"lat":31.5332901076,"lng":-84.2164572289,"zoom":10,"place":"DOUGHERTY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2045,"title":"Gopher John\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-04-18","end_date":"1842-04-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Officially, Gopher John was Major General McCall's interpreter, but during those long and informal nights on the Florida frontier, John was also his cook and friend. He was someone to talk to, and he cooked a yellow perch dish that really would have done honor to your cuisine at home. McCall and John were deep in the Florida wilderness, surrounding a fire in Wahoo Swamp, and the Major General in the United States Army struck up a conversation with the young man. A dog was lying peacefully by John's side, and McCall asked him how he came to have his dog, a great Indian cur, and what its name was. He replied that the dog's name was fuse because the girl he was courtin' for a wife, and all de gal fuse me (refused me). Dis so provoking to me, I git mad. After their conversation, McCall described Gopher John as my friend in his journal spanning thirty years of service on various American frontiers.","Gopher John was McCall's interpreter because he had a special skill set of a Black Seminole, a population that is much forgotten in southern history. In describing the young man, the adjectives employed touch on his biracial connections. John had grown up from a long-legged, ill-looking Negro boy to be a fine looking fellow of six feet, as straight as an Indian, with just a smile of red blood mantling to his forehead. In addition to his physical features, John retains his cognomen with the Indians as well as with the whites who lived in the Indian country before the war. Other Indian Negroes were feared by the U.S. Army for their ability to recruit slaves from local plantations, but John was able to straddle the racial fence between whites and Seminoles and occupy a social purgatory. Major McCall had a vested interest in seeing that Gopher John did not side with the Seminoles.","The history of blacks in Florida, and how they came to be associated and intertwined with the Seminole nation, is a complex one. Under Spanish rule until 1763, Florida had become a refuge for runaway slaves, even granting them freedom for military service. Some Black Seminoles were descendants of those who fought for the Spaniards at the Battle of Fort Mose in 1738. They began to settle among the Indians who were friendly to the Spanish and remained there after Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Seminole Chiefs even bought slaves, and runaway blacks from plantations in Carolina and Georgia continued to merge with the independent communities of free blacks on the outskirts of Seminole settlements. Naturally, interracial interaction occurred-sexually, culturally, and economically. Blacks supplied agricultural produce in return for protection; they were the vassals and allies of the Seminoles.","The unique role of interpreter for both whites and Seminoles was filled by men like Gopher John. He had relationships with the two communities, but of equal importance was his relationship to Major General McCall. As evidenced in Israel on the Appomattox by Melvin Ely, absolute racial blocs were not present in the antebellum South; for instance, black batteaumen had intimate social connections with whites in the context of economics. The racial distinctions blurred between McCall and Gopher John, and although their relationship was intended to be formal and official, it became something more natural. Hybrid cultures developed on Israel Hill, in Florida between blacks and Seminoles, and elsewhere across the South as traits were shared between different races as they came in daily contact with each other."],"display_date":"April 18, 1842","search_date":"1842-04-18","locations":[{"id":1362,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"HILLSBOROUGH, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2053,"title":"A Gunpowder Plot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-09","end_date":"1881-07-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Teddie and Lud visited the farm of a family friend out in the country.

There was not a hornet in sight. After planting the gunpowder in a small pile beneath the nest, Teddie focused his sunglass on the match. He retreated to the position of his companions. An explosion rocked the hornets' next, setting it ablaze. In half a second, hornets, which hummed like so many Minnie-balls, and came almost as fast, descended upon the trio. Two flew up Teddie's pantaloons. Bat turned to fly, when a hornet, coming straight as a bullet, struck him in the back of his head and lodged there... Lud could not escape the insects either. On the way back, they met Bat's old master, and gained his sympathy. When they finally arrived back home, the cook demanded an explanation for the boys' appearance. 'Hornicks,' replied the crestfallen Bat.","If Teddie, Lud, and Bat were students in Richmond's public school system, Bat would have attended one of the poorer black schools, while Teddie and Lud would have entered one of the better-funded white schools. Despite the racial inequalities found everywhere in the late nineteenth-century South, blacks and whites still interacted in positive ways in their daily lives. Teddie and Lud were excited to befriend someone who knew his way around the country farm; it did not matter to them that Bat's skin was black. Bat's old master responds with sympathy towards the plight of the three boys, and isn't bothered that two whites have a black boy as their companion. Similar interracial interaction occurred throughout the Upper South; in southern Maryland, blacks and whites worked side by side shelling oysters. In Baptist and Methodist churches across Virginia, blacks and whites often worshipped together. While issues of black and white inequality engulfed the political landscape of the South, blacks and whites could still treat each other as humans in their day-to-day interactions."],"display_date":"July 9, 1881","search_date":"1881-07-09","locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition.

He had always desired to see the city. The city was the object of greatest curiosity, fascinating the Bishop with its rich history. He stood in awe before a portrait of George Washington. The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced. Stanley Harrold writes in his book, <em>The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861</em>, about the growing white and black abolitionist's movement during this time. Garrisonians were fighting for the freedom of enslaved blacks across the South. Bishop was originally from the North and agreed with the Garrisonians.

He saw little or no action in the war for his first eighteen months of service, but he heard reports from members of his regiment who scouted the movement of the Confederate army. He was taken aback when he heard that Confederates had adopted the practice of hanging black men to discourage them and others from joining the Union army. Southerners were determined to punish any black man caught fighting against the South. In a letter to his wife and family in New Hampshire, Shedd proclaimed, Alas For the poor slave It is great wonder to me that they do not rebel; they would if they were not the most quiet, inoffensive race on earth. Besides expressing sympathy for blacks in this letter, he also claimed that slaves in Florida appeared to be more intelligent, to speak better English, and to be better looking than those he saw in South Carolina. To his disappointment, however, there were still no public schools in Florida where people of all races and classes could learn that all men are created equal in the sight of God.","Although many Union soldiers, perhaps even Shedd himself, were still racist during the Civil War, Shedd and other Northerners did see the many benefits of enlisting black soldiers as early as 1862. For many Union soldiers, the violent acts of southerners towards blacks were shocking and repulsive. The large free black population, their perceived prosperity and employment opportunities, and the extensive presence of Union garrisons in Key West all combined to positively influence perception of black Floridians. For Shedd, his intense patriotism, longing for his family, and strong sense of morality is what led him to denounce the maltreatment of blacks. ","Despite Shedd's belief that brave black volunteers did not deserve to be lynched for fighting alongside white Northerners, the lynching of blacks by Southerners, about which Shedd heard reports, did not end with the war, but instead, only gained momentum. In fact, people frequently extolled the lynching of black men as a way to enforce segregation in antebellum Florida. Reconstruction-era violence and lynching was rooted in the determination of white Floridians to keep blacks close to the brutal system of slavery which existed in Calvin Shedd's time.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

After describing the weather, terrain, and typical lifestyle, Dr. Byme acknowledged the differences between Florida cotton and that grown in other states but made sure to clarify the reason behind the variance. It is true that the average quality of Florida Cotton is not rated so high as that of the Sea Island, but the difference in this respect is chiefly, if not entirely, attributable to the defective manner of preparing the former for market. ","Despite the noted difference in quality, the long staple cotton of Florida sold for a high market price. This led Byme to claim that the lower quality (but greater amount) of Florida cotton was due more to a deficiency of care in its preparation for market than to an inferior product. Perhaps what Byme meant by claiming that there was a deficiency of care in cotton production was that the one-crop agricultural system implemented in Florida was problematic. It used crude, unscientific methods that left slaves incapable of working with the modern agricultural implements introduced in later years. Lacking versatility, Florida slaves could be taught little more than routine operations required in the growth of a single staple. ","In emphasizing the importance of quantity rather than quality for the Florida cotton planter, Byme was describing an economic reality of the region. When the Florida planter found that he could make an average crop of three hundred pounds of cotton to the acre, he was unlikely to bestow as much care on its preparation for market as the planter would on the Sea Islands of South Carolina where, Willie Lee Rose explained, one hundred twenty pounds was a good average crop. Dr. Byme wrote his pamphlet in such a way that clearly illustrated a widespread desire to jumpstart the Florida economy in the mid-nineteenth century. Byme praised the climate, landscape, people, and agriculture of Florida so as to prove the state's superiority over South Carolina and Texas, specifically. He boasted that Florida's seasons were more favorable to the production of cotton than those of any other Southern state. He wrote, Florida not only surpass[ed] Texas, but far excel[led] every other state in the Union.","In 1860, when Byme wrote the main article of his pamphlet, growing and selling cotton was, indeed, the most common way for Florida residents to earn cash. However, in future years, attempting to produce a cotton crop came to be a gamble for households that had limited labor resources (i.e. only had a small number of slaves, all of whom knew how to complete the same exact task). With the onset of the war, Floridians began to realize that they needed to reduce cotton production and increase food production if they wanted the South to survive. Many did not act through purely patriotic motives, however, but to the economic fact that cotton could not be sold in large quantities, and that foodstuffs, especially corn, could be readily sold and could produce a significant profit. Dr. Byme did not foresee the development of other agricultural industries when writing his pamphlet, but those readers who bought into his real estate propaganda soon learned the economic realities and needs of plantation life in the deep South."],"display_date":"April 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-04-01","locations":[{"id":1421,"lat":29.2235069663,"lng":-82.0960676488,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2090,"title":"Charles Whitehead Ridicules Jackson&#39;s Domestic Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-01","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jackson was a wealthy Florida planter who inherited several acres of land from his family. He owned dogs, horses, and men-servants and maid-servants were born in his house, and the forests surrounding Jackson's plantation were plentiful with wild animals. In 1860, he and Charles Whitehead decided to practice their hunting techniques on his property. They camped by the side of his house to spend a few days in pursuit of the chase. They relaxed in the tent and laughed wildly as the negroes ran to prepare food and the little nigs looked on from every out-of-the-way corner. They sat and drank as the slaves cooked for them in one of those little disconnected kitchens so favored by your true darky cook, who, when not turning the corn-bread, stands in her red bandana in the doorway with her arms akimbo, looming as large as the wonderful fat woman in the Museum. (Akimbo is a body position in which the hands are on the hips and the elbows are bowed outward.) Jovial and relaxed, Whitehead and Jackson cracked jokes about Jackson's slaves while they worked to prepare dinner and to maintain Jackson's estate.","The slaves Whitehead described clearly lived and worked in close proximity to where Jackson interacted with his fellow white men. While most Florida slaves usually ate in their cabins, those that Whitehead described were charged with the task of cooking and were also allowed to eat supper near their masters. This led to intense ridicule and the formation of stereotypes and derogatory terms about domestic blacks that persisted for decades. In his written accounts of his hunting adventures in the Everglades region of Florida, Charles Whitehead used terms like nig and darky to delineate the stark contrasts he perceived between the blacks and whites on Jackson's property. Not being wealthy enough to own slaves himself, Whitehead probably did not have any direct interaction with individual slaves. Therefore, his perception of blacks was all the more harsh and impersonal. For Whitehead, as for many, poor treatment of slaves was a way to dehumanize the black race in such a way that negated any guilt on the part of the white race."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":1428,"lat":26.6841881812,"lng":-82.0889710874,"zoom":7,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2091,"title":"Jesse Willis Petitions to Keep Slave Families Together\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jesse Willis, administrator of the estate of Amanda Willis, asked the Marion County court for permission to sell land (rather than slaves) from Marion's estate to repay his debts. He claimed that selling the slaves could not be done without upsetting Amanda's children. Willis added, the slaves are all of one family, and [they are] mostly children which are constantly increasing in value. He did not think it was right to separate families of slaves when it could be avoided. He realized that for slaves, the slave trade was more than just a financial exchange. A one-time miscalculation on the part of an owner might lead to a life-changing sale for the slave, and Jesse Willis did not want this to happen to his family's slaves. Instead, he insisted on avoiding the separation of slave families.","There have been several court documents that reveal that there were other masters who looked out for the welfare of the slave family. Other owners, like the Sanderson's in Duval County and the Hanson's in St. Johns County, would almost never sell a slave and refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. In addition to court proceedings, slave and master accounts also provide information about master-slave relations and the preservation of the slave family. One slave remembers that he never had to do any strenuous work as long as he won in marbles when he played against slaves of other masters. His master's goal was to excite the ambition of his slaves and promote loyalty through kindness, not to depress their spirits by fear and punishment.","Despite the handful of other cases of kind masters who cared for their slaves, Jesse Willis' demand in the Marion County court was not typical of Southern slave owners. The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved.

The man claimed to be one of the Bourbon Democrats, those who would spill the last drop of their blood rather than apply such titles to such a degraded, worthless, inferior race... The editor could only think that in this day and age, almost 13 years after the war that had ended the institution of slavery in the U.S., it was the man who had sent this letter who was being brazen. The author of the letter, a Mr. Henry T. Earnest, was actually claiming to write on behalf of all Southerners. The editor's first hope was that there was no truth to that claim, after the progress the nation had made; his second thought was how deeply unfortunate it was that Mr. Earnest believed the whole South shared his extreme opinion. That he even still felt there to be a South with its own identity and opinions so alien to those of the rest of the nation was a barrier to all that had been fought over so recently. He chose to publish the letter in the paper- accompanied by a rebuttal. He picked up his pen and began to draft the response. He would address this letter to every reader of The Post who might be wondering what stand the paper would take on such a relevant and sensitive issue. He wrote, So long as colored people are permitted to vote, we will feel constrained to address them as human beings...The gentleman who addresses us should have shed his blood during the late war. When the letters ran in the January 19th issue, he hoped that every reader would know that the paper stood behind progress, not racism."," The letter written to the editor of <em>The Post</em> by Mr. Earnest typifies the definition of the Bourbon Democrats as Willie D. Halsell describes it: ...a ruling group, once dethroned but now returned to power, who stubbornly hold to the past and refuse to adapt themselves to a changing world about them. Despite the fact that the war had resolved the issues of slavery and secession of the South, there were clearly those who felt no such resolution. As Miss Halsell explains, the Bourbons only represented a small subset of the Democratic party; however, their ideas would proliferate widely as the nation continued to struggle with the issue of racial equality. These ultra-conservative Democrats preached white supremacy, and fought privately and publicly (as is evidenced by this letter in the news) to defend what they believed to be white Americans' superiority over black Americans. However, though there were many like Mr. Earnest who made their racist views known during the post-Reconstruction period, there were also those like the editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> who openly accepted and stood up for the black man's right to citizenship and the respect which that citizenship demands for every American."],"display_date":"January 19, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-19","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2123,"title":"Slave Sale in Antebellum Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-09","end_date":"1835-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Thomas Harrison was a generous father. When the Virginia planter died in January 1835, he left his entire Henrico County plantation and all its contents to his son, Randolph, to deal with however he saw fit. As the executor of his father's estate, Randolph decided to turn his father's gift into a fresh start by selling off everything from farm machinery and supplies to animals and utensils. He also put up for auction the most valuable part of his father's household: his slaves. ","In an advertisement published in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser, the younger Harrison outlined his father's possessions and invited all those interested to attend an auction. Randolph boasted he would be selling, 60 or 70 valuable Negroes...More valuable slaves are not to be found. Along with the slaves, Randolph allowed neighbors to bid on barrels of corn, feed, oats, work horses, mules oxen, cattle, sheep, pigs, and machinery: all the remains of a successful plantation in its prime. Slaves, however, were clearly the most attractive items for sale.","For the slaves on the auction block, this event was to be expected. Once an owner died, slaves could typically anticipate their own sale, and many accounts of slaves' passage into the world of the slave trade begin with an owner's estate being liquidated. Upon receiving this news, many slaves ran away. It is impossible to know whether any of Harrison's slaves fled upon hearing the news of his death, but the thought almost certainly crossed their minds. ","Randolph Harrison's boastful description of his father's slaves sheds light on another tendency in the antebellum South. Typically, slaves entering the market were divided into categories (No. 1, Second Rate, and so on) based on physical traits, temperament, and skill. Slave traders had an interest in portraying their wares as best they could. When buyers compared nominally similar slaves in search of a few to serve their purpose, appearance could often make or break a deal. Randolph undoubtedly stood to make quite a profit from the sale of his father's 60 or 70 slaves - and a little embellishment was no doubt intended to pad his pockets even more."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2125,"title":"Runaway Slave Advertisement in Richmond, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-09","end_date":"1835-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Walk down the streets of any major city in America today and it is hard to miss the fliers. Leaflets advertising a lost dog or runaway cat grace lampposts and telephone poles on every street corner, many including descriptions, names, and last known whereabouts of beloved family pets. Like modern neighbors across America, slave owners in antebellum Richmond, Virginia advertised for the return of their lost property as well. Only in these cases, that property was a human.","A typical runaway notice appeared in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser in January, 1835 describing a fugitive slave named Billy and where he could be returned to if found. The advertisement included a reward (20), and a physical description. At the time of his escape, Billy was about twenty years old, stood six feet high, and was a skinny boy with a dark complexion. He also spoke with a slight stammer and had a scar near the corner of his right eye from a horse's kick that had barely missed blinding him. Billy's angry owner, Eliza S. Perkins, listed every one of these characteristics in her runaway notice and demanded that her slave be returned to her son in Richmond, or at least committed to jail. Ms. Perkins even speculated on where her fugitive might hide, explaining that Billy might be, lurking about Rocketts, in the city of Richmond, or in the town of Petersburg with the hope of leaving the Commonwealth, as his father is a sailor on some sea vessel which frequents those ports...Masters of vessels, she warned, are cautioned against receiving said boy on board.","Even though slaves of all types ran for freedom in antebellum Virginia, historians have found that 80 to 90 percent of runaways were male. Like Billy, most of these fugitives were young, single men in their twenties. The majority of these escapees made a run for it in the summer months. Ms. Perkins' advertisement made it clear that Billy had, left the plantation of my late husband in the month of July last. After the initial escape, fugitive slaves had to elude local informants, slave patrols, and bounty hunters. The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser was hardly unusual in publishing notices of runaways like Billy. Newspapers all over the South ran advertisements for the capture and return of fugitive property. If, and when, these runaways were found, every city in the South also had jails in which to hold slaves until their owners arrived to reclaim them."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2130,"title":"A Meeting of the Knox County Colonization Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-06-01","end_date":"1850-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the week of June 16, 1850, the Knox County Colonization Society convened for a meeting. This was of great significance because it marked the second anniversary of the Society in the city of Knoxville. At this time, the Chairman of this society declared that 15 to 20 free blacks of the city were ready to begin the process of emigration to Liberia. During the meeting, officers for the following year were also nominated and later, elected. The newly elected officers of the Executive Board were then granted the responsibility to communicate with applicants for emigration. Their duty was to instruct the applicants as of how to raise funds for the journey and any other information they might need to facilitate their quest.","Much about these potential emigrants is unknown. The African Americans in question could have been free blacks who had decided on their own accord to migrate to Africa where they could live freely. This scenario, however, is unlikely due to the expense such a journey would require. More likely than not, these were former slaves who were recently released by their masters. After slaves were manumitted, their options were limited in terms of where they could settle. Often, in order to live freely, they were required to either leave their homes and migrate to a non-slave state or travel to Liberia. With the monetary help of their former owner and benevolent organizations like the Knox County Colonization Society, this trip could be made feasible. ","Though many states and localities created colonization societies, only a small percentage of blacks actually made the journey to Liberia. Although expense was a key deterrent, other factors also played a role in inhibiting this movement. Historian Melvin Ely argues that a significant barrier to the success of colonization were the wishes of blacks themselves. Many did not like the idea of leaving behind the only world that they knew. If free blacks themselves were not compelled to make this journey, whose best interests were taken into account for this movement's justification? Ely shed some light on this question by noting the abolitionist opposition to emigration. Abolitionists believed that black emigration to Liberia was just a cover for the desire of whites to rid themselves of the burden of the free black population. Armed with this perspective, one begins to question whether this movement was as benevolent or as humanitarian as it appeared on its surface."],"display_date":"June 1850","search_date":"1850-06-15","locations":[{"id":12155,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2133,"title":"A Fugitive Slave Case in Knox County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-04-01","end_date":"1851-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In April of 1851, a fugitive slave case involving a black man by the name of Sydney was decided in the Knox County Circuit Court. Sydney's counsel argued that he was a free black man born in Tennessee, whom at an unspecified date was kidnapped and smuggled across the state line to Alabama. There, he was subsequently sold into bondage. The case arose when Sydney escaped from his master and returned to Tennessee. Sydney was found by the court to be a fugitive slave and was directed to be returned to his master in Alabama. After the case was tried, two reports were published in the <em>Knoxville Register</em> by a lawyer named Swan who had brought Sydney's suit to court. In these reports, Swan claimed to accurately document the <em>real</em> facts of the case. Another lawyer, by the name of J.M. Welcker, who had served as legal counsel to the adverse side of the case, read this report and was shocked by its inaccuracy. He believed that the writer of this faulty report had intended to stir up trouble on the subject of slavery. Welcker felt that it was his duty as a citizen to clarify the ruling of this case for the general public.","According to Swan, Phillis, the mother of Sydney, was promised emancipation by her former master in Delaware upon reaching thirty-one years of age. Sydney was born to Phillis in the State of Tennessee before her thirty-first birthday. Swan claimed that upon turning thirty-one, Phillis and her son Alfred, who was also born before Phillis was declared free, were both emancipated by the Tennessee court system. Thomas Brown, the owner of Phillis and her children in Tennessee, was, according to Swan, fully aware of their right to freedom. Swan insinuated by this point that Sydney, like his brother, was also manumitted after his mother had turned thirty-one. Welcker stated that this information was incorrect and anyone familiar with the area would have known that Sydney was born to an enslaved woman, therefore making him a slave by birth. According to Welcker, the children born to Phillis <em>after </em>her manumission were viewed as free. However, no provision was made for the emancipation of the children she gave birth to before she reached the age of thirty-one. Therefore, Sydney was legally a slave when sold to his Alabama master in 1830.","The crux of this case revolved around the status of Sydney's mother at the time of his birth. According to Joshua Rothman, the law of descent claimed that slavery is passed down through the mother. Therefore, if the mother is a slave, the child born of the enslaved woman is also a slave. This point illustrates that if Phillis was indeed enslaved at the time of Sydney's birth, then he was born into slavery and as a result, could only be legally freed by his master."],"display_date":"April 1851","search_date":"1851-04-15","locations":[{"id":12155,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2138,"title":"Adoption of an Ordinance in Marietta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-02-13","end_date":"1852-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jenny, an African American woman residing in Marietta, Georgia, desperately wanted to move. In 1852, the local government of Marietta passed an ordinance against negroes hiring out their own time or living on lots to themselves. This new law was greatly at odds with Jenny's current living situation. Jenny believed that under the law she would no longer prosper at her current residence. Faced with these unfavorable circumstances, she traveled to Atlanta to see if her options there would be any better. In the city, she encountered a certain Mr. Jeremiah who agreed to take her in on his lot and protect her. To determine whether or not Jenny could take this course of action, Andrew J. Hansell sent a letter to Farish Carter asking for him to approve of her removal to Atlanta.","What remains unclear in this episode is the status of Jenny, the African American woman who desired to relocate. It seems as if Jenny's lifestyle had been seriously affected on account of the passage of Marietta's ordinance. Her displeasure with the new law indicates that she was either hiring herself out for work or living on a lot to herself. Considering these factors, one might conclude that Jenny was a free black. However, the letter sent from Hansell to Carter requesting approval for Jenny to move to Atlanta implied that Jenny was not free to make decisions concerning her place of residence. This letter also mentioned that Jenny would have to return home if she was not permitted to move to Atlanta. The use of the word <em>home</em> indicated that her inhabitance of the dwelling in Marietta was only temporary. ","This incident shows the types of measures local governments in the Antebellum South took to deprive African Americans of what little freedom they had left to enjoy. Due to the passage of Marietta's ordinance, a free black community, like that of Israel Hill in Virginia that historian Melvin Ely describes in his book <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, would never be realized in Cobb County. On Israel Hill, free blacks were permitted to live independently and hire themselves out as laborers. Ely does note, however, that as the issue of slavery grew on the federal level in the 1850's, whites tried once again to reduce the status of free blacks down to a level very close to slavery. It is quite possible that this retrogression of attitudes towards slavery was what the slaves and free blacks of Marietta saw with the passage of the Ordinance in the early 1850's.

An enslaved African American woman of Polk County, Tennessee put an end to the lives of her children and then took her own life one September night in 1852. Authorities confirmed that the woman killed all four of her children by slitting their throats while they slept. After the gruesome deed had been carried out, she too ended her life in the same manner. When questioned about the possible basis for the woman's actions, the slave's master, George M. Garrison, alluded to the possibility that the woman may have overheard him discussing the potential sale of herself and two of her children while keeping the others in his possession. Beyond this, the owner could think of no other impetus for such an act.","Only the woman ever knew for certain the rationale which drove her to take her own life and the lives of her four children. The insinuation of her master, however, that the slave woman had knowledge of his intent to break apart her family, offers valuable insight. When viewed from this vantage point, it appears that for this mother, the possibility of a life without all of her children was just too much for her to bear. It is probable that after overhearing her master's plans to divide her family, the woman decided that ending the lives of her entire family would be less painful than separation. Based upon this speculation, it can be inferred that this heart wrenching act was committed out of desperation. ","This incident underscores the adverse impacts that the slave trade had on the African American family. The breaking up of families was not at all uncommon in the Antebellum South. Husbands and wives, parents and children were all constantly faced with the threat of separation. In his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, historian Walter Johnson claims that 50 percent of interstate slave trades tore apart nuclear families and therefore, the strength of family ties was never certain. Through examples similar to the episode above, Johnson argues that self destruction or the threat of self destruction was a common method utilized to avoid trade. According to Johnson, these instances portrayed the dark side of slave trade and served as a foundation for its opposition. In effect, this tragic account along with many others brought to light the horrors of slavery. In the bigger picture this increased awareness spawned anti-slavery reactions and eventually influenced the American abolitionist movement."],"display_date":"September 1852","search_date":"1852-09-15","locations":[{"id":12302,"lat":35.1199101303,"lng":-84.5233135097,"zoom":10,"place":"POLK, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2150,"title":"Dispute with Slave Trader\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-10-01","end_date":"1841-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1841, R. Ballard, a slave trader who owned property in Mississippi, brought a Federal suit against Henry Turner, claiming the Turner owed him 6,300 dollars. The bill was the remainder owed for forty-two slaves that Ballard had sold to Turner in 1835. Unfortunately for Ballard, Turner was quite unhappy with his purchase. He returned seven of the slaves to Ballard, declaring that they were either unsound or older than Ballard had told him they would be and demanded a full refund. However, Ballard would not take back some of the flawed slaves. Ballard refused to take back one slave on account of his being an idiot, and recommended that the slave be auctioned. Ballard also would not take back two older slaves, nor would he exchange others for them."," The bill for these slaves had accrued interest until the balance was 6,300 dollars. Turner refused to pay. He felt that he had been swindled by Ballard. Turner claimed that Ballard misled him with regard to the character and soundness of the slaves. Turner also claimed that he had been misinformed about the origin of the slaves. Finally, Turner alleged that Ballard charged him more interest than had been decided upon at the initial sale."," Whatever the outcome of the case, Turner viewed Ballard as a con-artist who propagated the plantation owners' negative views of the slave trade. Southern whites viewed slave traders as being fraudulent and malicious. They believed that most of the slaves being sold were flawed in some way, and that the slave trader was making off with an unfairly large profit. "," Slave traders capitalized on the expansion of southern territory. As more land opened up for cotton plantations, traders brought more slaves to Mississippi. By 1840, there were more slaves than white citizens in the state. The Mississippi Delta's proximity New Orleans, a major center for slave trade, fueled the influx of slaves. Plantation owners returned again and again to New Orleans to buy labor for their cotton fields. They viewed slaves not as people, but as investments. Turner's case displays this inhuman treatment of blacks in the slave trade. In the markets of New Orleans, slaves were treated not as humans, but as objects whose values could be quantified based on their age and appearance. Historian Walter Johnson calls this psychologically damaging treatment the chattel principle. The chattel principle is unmistakable in Turner's description of his transactions with Ballard. He viewed the slaves as assets that could be priced differently based on certain characteristics. Turner's case demonstrates that southern plantation owners viewed slave traders as being shamelessly dishonest and saw slaves simply as valuable pieces of property."],"display_date":"October 1, 1841 - October 30, 1841","search_date":"1841-10-15","locations":[{"id":6925,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2154,"title":"Conversion from the Presbyterian Church to the Baptist Church\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1837-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Unlike the Presbyterian or Episcopal Church, the Methodist Church in the 1830s did not require that its clergy be educated. In fact, education was sometimes frowned upon, particularly on the frontier where ministers rode around preaching to small communities. These ministers, called circuit riders, led a particularly dangerous life traveling through undeveloped areas. Because of the lifestyle of circuit riders, they were expected not to settle down in one location or marry. However, in 1839 a Methodist circuit rider founded a college in Brandon, Mississippi. ","Reverend Benjamin Drake was a Methodist minister and a circuit rider. In the 1830s, a time when Mississippi began to fall behind the rest of the nation in terms of education, Drake was planning to start a college. He received a letter from his friend C. K. Marshall addressing the issue of the location of the school. Drake had originally planned on establishing the college in Clinton. Marshall's letter swayed him to look at another location. Marshal described the striking beauty of Brandon Mineral Springs at length, calling it the most enchanting and lovely place [he] ever saw. The property consisted of 54 buildings on 1005 acres of land. Marshall admitted that Brandon was difficult to reach, but railroads would make it more accessible. The manor was also inexpensive - ten or twenty thousand dollars for the estate including furniture. Money may have been an issue, because circuit riders were very poorly paid. The location was perfect for Drake's institution. "," Thus Centenary College was founded by Drake in 1839 in Brandon Springs, Mississippi. Though the Methodist religion in Mississippi traditionally did not place a high value on education, this preacher still established a school. Drake's precise motives in founding the school are unidentified, but it is known that Methodists at this time were concerned with changing the society around them and making the world a better place. Because only the elite could afford to send their children to college, the school probably would have affected the sons of the wealthier plantation owners in the area. The founding of Centenary College shows that while the Methodist church did not place high value on the education of its clergy, it encouraged the creation of educational institutions for other members of the population."],"display_date":1837,"search_date":"1837-07-02","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2161,"title":"Elick&#39;s Escape Plan\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-03-11","end_date":"1860-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alden Spooner Forbes, a planter and merchant in Port Gibson, Claiborne County, Mississippi, wrote in his diary on March 11, 1860, that this was the night that he first discovered his slave Elick's plan of running away. He realized Elick's plan when he could not find him at night and immediately, the following day, March 12, put Elick in jail for safekeeping and to ensure he could not escape. Two days after this, on March 14, Forbes gave Elick a severe whipping in hopes of finding out all of the details about his plan of running away, but was only able to confirm that the slave did truly intend on escaping. Placing Elick in jail again on March 15 after another unsuccessful attempt at literally beating the information out of him, Forbes released him on March 21, only to send Elick away on an errand, fearing the whole time that he would attempt to run to freedom at any moment."," Whether or not Elick did eventually run away is unknown, but his plan to escape was not unique. Many slaves entertained the idea of running away to the North, prompted by news about freedom for blacks from northern abolitionists that was creeping into southern territory. The southern belief that the Republican Party was out to destroy slavery caused animosity towards the North and during the year before the start of the Civil War in April 1861, tensions reached an all time high between the northern and southern states. The controversial election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted southerners to begin considering the idea of succession much more seriously. The northern abolitionist's rhetoric of freeing the enslaved African Americans did nothing to please white southerners like Alden Spooner Forbes who depended on the labor of enslaved people to earn a livelihood. The thought that this very same rhetoric of equality and freedom was reaching the ears of their laborers intensified the white southern secessionists' hostility towards the northern abolitionists. The fear of new ideas of freedom formulating in their slaves' minds provoked many, like Forbes, to be especially harsh on their laborers in an attempt to keep them from trying to escape."," Mississippi did indeed secede from the Union on January 9, 1861. People like Forbes who depended on the labor of slaves drove this secession because they could not imagine a world without slavery, like the one they thought northern Republicans would try to create. The thought that slaves would internalize the ideas of the abolitionists regarding their freedom from bondage frightened those who depended on their labor. It was this fear that prompted many of them, in Mississippi and the rest of the South, to use cruel methods, such as whipping, to try and convince them that life as an enslaved laborer was the only life for them.

According to Wailes, General Starkle, another Senate member, proposed to send a commission to the legislature of Virginia to discuss the state of federal relations and to procure a co-operation of resistance to the northern aggressions by the southern states, which is expected to result in the dissolution of the Union. Wailes then stated, Truly our insane politicians seem to be determined to drive us into a state of anarchy and civil war and I see that the most disastrous condition of things is inevitable."," On April 24, 1860, Everard Green Baker, another white planter from Jefferson County, Mississippi, wrote in his diary, I fear there are terrible times ahead of us...There is this consolation - that we will be fighting for our homes, our lives, our families and our property. "," During the election of 1860, the talk of secession grew a great deal among Mississippians. It had been brought up before this time that if the northern states elected a president without the support of the South, that Mississippi would secede. When Lincoln, a Republican, won and took office, Mississippians were outraged because not a single one of them had cast a vote in his favor. In fact, no one in the Deep South had because they viewed the Republicans, and thus Lincoln, as staunch abolitionists who desired to rid the nation of slavery at the soonest possible moment. Mississippians held true to their promise, and two months after Lincoln's election, a statewide convention voted to secede from the Union. "," Mississippians, like many residents of the Deep South, had several fears of what a Republican government would do to their existence. Some, like Wailes, most prominently feared the destruction of the Union and were against secession. Most others, like Baker, felt that southern culture would meet its demise from the Republicans because they believed that the North, with its industrial endeavors, was unable to comprehend how necessary slavery was to the South's economy (or how necessary they felt it was). Thus, the white South was not necessarily fighting for slavery, but more so for a South with its foundations based on slavery. "," White southerners had become so accustomed to their slave society that they were terrified at the thought that the Republicans would try and force them to be without it. Many southerners had achieved an extremely comfortable life because of the peculiar institution. Their economy was the fourth richest in the world, they controlled 60 percent of all United States imports, and had more railroad lines than anywhere else in the world. They felt that this would no longer be the case without the system of bondage that they held African Americans in, and it was the idea that Lincoln and his party would destroy it that led them to talk of secession and eventually carry it out. Lincoln cited his priority as keeping the Union together, not abolishing slavery. However, it was the southerners' suspicion and distrust of the Republican's and North's differing ideals that caused the eventual severing of national ties."],"display_date":"January 21, 1860 - April 24, 1860","search_date":"1860-03-07","locations":[{"id":6927,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2164,"title":"Problematic Labor Contracts\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-17","end_date":"1868-11-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the Civil War ended in 1865, hundreds of thousands of enslaved people suddenly found themselves without an owner. With very little money or land of their own, they were often unsure of how or where to proceed next. A system of sharecropping thus evolved where the newly freedmen rented tracts of land from landowners and were expecting to give the landowners a portion of the profits made from the crops harvested on that land. Labor contracts were then signed arranging the details of what was expected of the freedmen and of the landowner.","On February 17, 1865, newly freed Henry Kanes, signed a contract with Chandler Sueham in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The contract allotted that Sueham, the landowner, would provide Kanes with the land and tools necessary to produce a crop, and in return, Kanes was to attend to Sueham's flock (no specific animal stated), as well as pay Sueham back one-third of the profits he gleaned from the land. Contracts like this led to discontent between the sharecroppers and landowners because they often felt like the other was not holding up their end of the bargain. Disputes arose because of beliefs that perhaps the sharecropper was not working hard enough, or that the landowner was not providing what was agreed upon in the signed contract. The Assistant Commissioner for the state of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land, reported to General O.O. Howard on November 28, 1868, that there had been many complaints filed recently about these labor contracts. The problems reported were specifically prompted by an upcoming election for delegates to the state convention that had impelled many freedmen to leave their work for the purpose of attending meetings held by political aspirants. The landowners from the Mississippi delta region were particularly unhappy because the laborers had missed several prime harvest days for the meetings, and they felt that the crops had thus faltered. "," Instances like these led to the precarious situation that Mississippi found itself in after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The majority of the newly freed people were generally unable to use what little savings they might have had to buy land of their own. Thus, they once again found themselves having to answer to a superior, who was normally a white man. The sharecropping system, originally intended to help the freed people on their way towards full independence had thus began to resemble the system of slavery that had prevailed for so long before it. The labor contracts were usually heavily weighted in favor of the white landowner, and the wages earned by the sharecroppers were so low that black women and children found themselves having to work so the family could survive. Women usually kept house for white families, and children engaged in seasonal field labor. Thus, emancipation did not eliminate the need for large amounts of labor in the South, and the labor contracts that resulted only slightly increased freedmen's control over their situation. In places like the Mississippi Delta, entire freed families found themselves working in order to make ends meet. Labor contracts gave the newly freedmen some sense of independence from white masters, but the conflicts that arose from the differing opinions of the laborers and landowners led to discontent among the majority of southerners dealing with the system of sharecropping."],"display_date":"February 17, 1865 - November 28, 1868","search_date":"1867-01-08","locations":[{"id":7123,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2165,"title":"Freedmen&#39;s Marriages\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-07-16","end_date":"1867-07-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" At the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, two million slaves suddenly found themselves emancipated from the system of bondage that they had known their entire lives. The United States was in a unique situation in which it was not quite sure how to handle the differences between its new society with all freed African Americans, and its old slaveholding one. In order to help the refugees of the Civil War, and to establish a sense of stability in the country during this precarious time, the United States government formed the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned lands in March 1865. Immediately, the Bureau found its main challenge to be that of helping the freedmen acclimate to their new situation."," Members of the bureau in De Soto, Mississippi, sent a report dated July 15, 1867, to General O.O. Howard. It stated that it seems impossible to make the ignorant class of freed people understand their marriage relations. Husbands leave wives and wives leave their husbands. The Assistant Commander had some of them arrested, and after explaining to them their duties and obligations in this respect, induced them to return to their homes and live together amicably. "," Due to the fact that marriages between slaves were not legally recognized before the Civil War, and subsequent emancipation of the slaves, the Freedmen's Bureau was responsible for solemnizing formerly unrecognized slave marriages. In Mississippi alone, more than 4,000 marriages between African Americans were legally legitimized by the Freedmen's Bureau by 1866. These former slaves appreciated the recognition of their marriages in a legal fashion a great deal. They could only be socially married while enslaved, forcing them to be at the mercy of their masters in terms of being sold away from their spouse. Many found themselves separated from the ones they loved, and had oftentimes formed a family with. "," Sometimes slave parents' sense of fidelity was lessened as they were sold away from their partners and they subsequently had no control over the fate of their children and familial relationships. Certainly not all freedmen felt this way, and there was a great deal of fidelity throughout the black community. However, many former slaves did find themselves in polygamous situations at the conclusion of the Civil War when the Freedmen's Bureau helped to restore their original families. Like in the report from De Soto, Mississippi, this caused some freedmen to leave the person they were now considered legally married to, who they had not been with for perhaps years, because they had produced children with that person. The Bureau in Mississippi tried to force these separated couples back together in an attempt at stability and fidelity. Whether or not these couples listened and stayed together is unknown, but it was the newfound stability of the living circumstances for freedmen that caused much of the instability among them because they were so accustomed to life without it."],"display_date":"July 16, 1867","search_date":"1867-07-16","locations":[{"id":7019,"lat":34.7811371772,"lng":-89.974549402,"zoom":9,"place":"DE SOTO, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2172,"title":"A Family of Slaves Torn Apart?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-04-13","end_date":"1853-04-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the horrors associated with the institution of slavery was that it constantly tore families apart because slaveholders would sell off members of black families to different and often distant locations. While this was a common occurrence, the benevolence of a significant portion of slaveholders who tried to keep slave families together is often ignored. The sale of a family of slaves by a Jacob Ruff of Augusta County to his daughter Jane Wilson provides illustrates such an example of benevolence. He sold a mother and her three children to Jane for the meager price of 1. The black family consisted of a 33 year old black woman named Lilly, a 5 year old boy named Toney, a 3 year old named Jane, and a one year old named Easter. The contract stated that the slaves were to be passed down from generation to generation indefinitely. The record of this sale contradicts the argument made by historian Walter Johnson in his history, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. One of the major themes in this book is that slaveholders manipulated slave families in order to get what they wanted from their slaves. Johnson argues that slaveholders frequently bargained with their slaves, promising not to sell the slave's family if he/she complied with their wishes. He reveals however, that slaveholders often broke their end of the compromise by selling members of the slave's family anyway. This occurrence in Augusta County provides evidence that Johnson's argument is by no means infallible considering the fact that Ruff sold a mother and all of her children to the same owner and furthermore that they were to be passed down from generation to generation. There are always at least two sides to history, and while Johnson's novel depicts the evil of slavery and the malicious actions of slave owners, he fails to acknowledge that this was not always the case."],"display_date":"April 13, 1853","search_date":"1853-04-13","locations":[{"id":13638,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2174,"title":"A Desperate Plea to the Whigs of Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-10-06","end_date":"1836-10-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The nomination of a candidate for president proved to be a trying issue in Augusta County in 1836. The South was weakened by growing factionalism. It was divided between Southern Democrats in favor of Martin Van Buren and Southern Whigs in favor of William H. Harrison.

He condemned the negativity of those Whigs who viewed the election of William Harrison as hopeless, stating that the strength of the Democratic Party resided in the fact that they displayed no such feelings of apathy towards their candidate.

Mr. Grove's spirituality transcended Shermariah into the educational realm in that he served as a professor of religion for 20 years. His religious beliefs manifested themselves in his charitable nature. He donated a significant portion of the land on which Shermariah Chuch was constructed and also donated funds to help build the Shermariah Academy. Unlike many of the deaths that occurred in Augusta County in the antebellum South, Mr. Grove's was unique in that he died free of debt. His lack of debt can also be attributed to his religious beliefs. Grove was very familiar with the scriptures and lived by them. One such scriptural saying was, owe no man anything.","It was said that Mr. Grove's farm reflected many of his admirable characteristics such as his good management and industrious habits. Though he possessed only a small piece of land, it was lucrative due to its high state of cultivation. At the time of Mr. Grove's death, the land was worth two to three times more than if he had bought two to three additional pieces of farmland. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Mr. Grove's death, however, is the fact that one of his servant women died about 15 minutes after he did. She was also a member of Shermariah Church and it was believed by the citizens of Augusta County that they had both gone to the same blessed reward. ","The dichotomy of this obituary lies in the fact that during life of earth, slaveholders of Augusta County treated African Americans not only as their inferiors, but as their property; meanwhile, they sat through church services in the same sanctuary. They worshipped the same god and believed that they experienced the same afterlife. The role churches played in race relations of the antebellum South is a major theme in Melvin Patrick Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>. Ely portrays a culture similar to that of this obituary, where blacks and whites attended the same churches. These churches nurtured the moral similarities of people of both races. Furthermore, according to Ely, churches leveled the playing field between whites and blacks by acknowledging the spiritual gifts of each, and by identifying their equal ability to sin. During the 1840s and 1850s, white evangelicals felt it was their duty to bring black members into their churches. Spending on ministries to slaves increased dramatically. In the Methodist Church in particular, it increased from 167,258.87 in 1829 to 1,706,207.70 by 1864.

The Spectator was certain that their nomination of William Harrison and John Tyler would receive a hearty response from the county, triggering a patriotic outburst of feeling worthy of Old Augusta, and worthy of the crisis. The newspaper praised Augustan citizens by saying that a vote for the Harrison/Tyler ballot was a vote for sound judgment, patriotism, and most notably, uniform obedience to the constitution and laws. ","The Whigs of Augusta County, Virginia knew, however, that the battle for the White House was far from over. They had to execute a strong national campaign in order to secure the victory. They did everything in their power to mobilize voters to support General William Harrison in his campaign for the presidency. Residents across Augusta worked together towards this common goal. One William Kinney of Staunton wrote to Newton Steele in another part of Augusta County regarding a club they had formed to help Harrison gain support. They called it the Tippacanoe Club after the nickname General Harrison had earned due to his victory over the American Indians in the Battle of Tippacanoe in 1811.

The newspaper proudly proclaimed that it went off with a success, which we believe has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its friends.  Despite the heat of the day the decorated hall attracted great crowds with its cool refreshments and informative exhibits about colonization. Although the paper did not report the total amount of money raised, it praised the women's philanthropic motives to help black colonists overcome the disease, famine, and...hostility...[that] threaten [a new colony's] feeble and precarious existence.","This altruistic effort by women was not unusual in the antebellum South; women commonly managed associations for the sick and poor, but it was their desire to assist free blacks that distinguished these women from later women of Virginia.  The women of the Female Association of Albemarle County were largely upper class women who lived in a slave-based society and yet, because of their fear of violence and desire for missionary activity, they staunchly supported colonization when they might have considered themselves above such a concern.","The recent slave rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, and Nat Turner in 1831 were only too recent in the minds of southerners and had generated great social fear, particularly for Virginians.  In these revolts, slaves had revolted against the rule of their white masters and free blacks had violated the privilege of their freedom, labeling themselves as a threatening group of people who endangered the property of the South. The violence of these revolts particularly endangered white women and children who had been among some of the blacks' first victims.  As an act of self-defense therefore, Albemarle County's women joined in the intensified protests on behalf of African colonization to reduce the unnecessary and dangerous amount of blacks in the South.","Other Virginian women hoped that colonization would spread Christianity in Africa. The women of Albemarle specifically praised the American Colonization Society for its desire to plant a germ of christianity and civilization, which will spring up to bless Africa, whose fruit will sustain the principles of Liberty in unborn generations.  As Robert Johnson, Jr. discusses, these women, along with many other southerners, credited slavery as the institution that had introduced Christianity to blacks; for this reason, they hoped that the free blacks who emerged from the system of slavery as Christian, civilized beings could spread these virtues to all of Africa.","On June 1, 1830, only a few weeks later, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>published a brief letter addressed to The Reverend Mr. Gurley of the American Colonization Society concerning the funds raised from the Albemarle County fair.  The Female Association offered the Reverend a gift of 500 dollars to aid the Colonization Society and requested that a lien be retained on the funds contributed by this association, by which, at any future period, any free people of color from this county, who may wish to go to Liberia, shall have the precedence of all others in any embarkation, at least to the full amount of the funds contributed by this association.  The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported this news because the state of Virginia had one of the largest networks of colonization chapters in the United States and many would have been encouraged by their efforts.","Other states would have also been interested because during this era similar support for colonization was prevalent throughout the South.  Johnson contends that while some in the South displayed a genuine humanitarian concern for the well-being of blacks, the majority of southerners advocated colonization on account of their fear of black rebellion, the uncertainty concerning the future of free blacks, and the lagging economy. In Johnson's view the South believed colonization would protect the value of the slave property and remove those Africans who were an economic drain upon the plantation system.

In Chatham County, they invested a lot of money in growing rice, as did many planters across the lowcountry regions of both states. However, in 1844 Charles began to be slightly disgruntled with the labor production of his slaves and began comparing their efficiency to that of other slaves. Other planters told him that twelve bushels of clean winnowed rice would be average one day, but then the next day they would only get about five or six. This inconsistency was unsettling to most large planters. Manigault voiced his concerns with his overseer A.R. Bagshaw. Bagshaw told him that with the twenty-five slaves that were working the threshing area, they should get at least fifteen bushels a day. However, the week before they were only producing about ten bushels. This led to the consternation of Manigault and the overseer, and they blamed the slaves. They accused the slaves of finding ways to get around their production duties, and of only fulfilling them to the rule, not to the greatest extent. Bagshaw said that the slaves were cunning enough to remember that what they are harvesting they will have to thresh, and will tie as small sheaves as they can. Manigault tried to come up with a solution to this production problem, but Bagshaw assured him that the slaves were smart and efficient enough to find ways to get around them.","The problem Manigault had with his rice production was not unique to his plantation. In fact, it happened in plantations all over the lowcountry districts of South Carolina and Georgia. The unique rice-growing agriculture in those districts called for a different kind of labor than did the cotton or tobacco growing areas. There were limits to planter's authority all over the South, because no matter how harsh they were, slaves often were cunning or brave enough to find ways to subvert their master's plans. It was even easier for slaves to do this in the lowcountry rice area, where Manigault had his plantation, due to the type of task forces that were used for cultivating rice. The tasks were not based on time (such as working from 6 am to 6 pm) but on how many crops were produced. Planters decided what they thought was a reasonable amount of product, and the slaves had to cultivate that amount. Once the slaves were done, they often got to use their free time for other activities such as socializing, selling or tending their own crops, and other activities. So slaves, such as those on Manigault's plantation, found ways to produce the right amount of sheaves but made them smaller in size. This way, they could get around their masters orders while still fulfilling his supposed goals. Also, jobs on these plantations were more individualized than on cotton plantations, so an industrious slave could complete his day's work faster and have more free time than his owner expected. To some extent slaves could reject the clock on a rice plantation and work at their own pace as long as they completed the task. Also, not working as efficiently as a master wanted, but still getting working so as to avoid punishment, was a strong form of resistance among slaves. Slaves did not often feel personally about their work, so subverting their masters by producing slightly less was a good way to punish their owners. So although Manigault and his neighbors felt frustrated about the labor on their plantations, these frustrations were most likely felt all across the lowcountry districts of the South, due to the nature of their agricultural system and its needs, and to the cleverness of the slaves that worked their fields."],"display_date":1844,"search_date":"1844-07-01","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2197,"title":"James Cody Sues John Baily Over Slander Regarding Illegal Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-12-11","end_date":"1850-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Cody of Bryan County, Georgia prided himself in having a good reputation as a respectable Southern man. When his neighbor John Baily accused him of buying rice from a slave without written permission from the slave's owner, he was extremely offended. He considered these accusations to be false and demanded to meet John Baily in court to settle this slanderous dispute. Cody felt that Baily's remarks offended his honor and implied that Cody was a dishonest trader and guilty of buying and keeping stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He felt that his good reputation was at stake and he needed to go to court to settle the matter. He also demanded that Baily pay him 5,000 dollars in damages, a huge sum in the 1850's.",">James Cody's indignation and determination to repair his honor, seek redress, and prove that he would not illegally trade with slaves demonstrates many important principles and customs of the South in the 1850's. Lawsuits about slander and false accusations were not uncommon in the South, especially among men. This was due to the fact that a man's honor was central to his sense of self and his public image, so any kind of slander or ill talk would be insulting. Insults, or anything that offended a man's honor, questioned a man's very masculinity. Many people in the South reacted very strongly to an affront to their respectability, and would take the accuser to court. For example, a man in Prince Edwards County, Virginia took his slanderer to court, saying he would rather get back his honor than get money in the case. To those Southerners who did sue for money, such as Cody, the huge amounts of money they asked for probably represented how offended they were at an affront to their honor. ","The second aspect of this case that represented the state of the South, was the fact that the specific slander regarded a white man trading with a slave without the master's permission. Black Codes or laws regarding slaves and their conduct had existed since the very beginning of the eighteenth century, but they got more rigid and more encompassing throughout the nineteenth century all across the South. It was illegal in most states by 1850 for a slave to trade or sell goods without his master's written consent. He was not allowed to trade publicly for his own benefit at all unless his master deemed this acceptable, which some did. A slave guilty of violating a law like this was often punished with a whipping. One reason for this law was that trading and selling allowed slaves some degree of autonomy and gave them their own money, if their master did not demand the proceeds they made from their sales. It also gave them more independence and could make less interested in their master's concerns, which was something whites came to fear more and more as the number of slaves rose. As their numbers rose, so did the potential threat for rebellion or a general challenging of complete white supremacy. Also, as questions over slavery were discussed elsewhere in the nation it added to the insecurity felt throughout the South.","The result of the Cody-Bailey case is not known, or was at least not documented in the court petition record, or it may have been lost over time. However, the important themes that arise in this case are themes that pervaded the pre-war South. The ideas of male honor, the power of slander and the lawsuits that could arise from it, and of the increase in slave codes throughout the South in the mid-eighteenth century, all speak of important ideals and trends in both Georgia, and the South, as a whole."],"display_date":"December 11, 1850","search_date":"1850-12-11","locations":[{"id":1562,"lat":31.8212333753,"lng":-81.1636262055,"zoom":9,"place":"BRYAN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2199,"title":"Savannah Reverend Addresses Religious Conditions of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-05-01","end_date":"1846-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Dexter Clapp of Savannah, Georgia got word of a question put forth in a newspaper, presumably by a Northerner, about the religious condition of slaves in the South. Clapp felt compelled to write a letter to the editor discussing his opinion on the matter. He stated that much of what he had to say was probably not known in the North, but was common knowledge in the South, or at least in his region of Georgia. He spoke of the enormous religious capacity of Southern slaves and the wonderful ways they took to Christian morals, even while in the lowest sphere of society. He also commended white Christians of the South who made it their duty to spread the Gospel to slaves, and said that the care of the spiritual wants of slaves were being given more and more attention by whites. He said that while in cities like Charleston, slaves and masters were often in the same churches and he found that encouraging, in Savannah blacks usually had their own churches. He stated that this was not a bad thing, and that slaves had their own black leaders and clergymen and had independence in their religious worship. Also, he mentioned that the majority of slaves went to church; the largest black church in Savannah having over fifteen hundred members. He also referenced a free black preacher who was not only was the highest paid preacher in the entire city, but who also was immensely successful in preaching to illiterate slaves, and making the Gospel applicable to their everyday lives. He commented that these slaves were as good of Christians as their educated masters. He also claimed that the black preacher seemed to be a defender of slavery, while that may be questioned by many historians. In general, Clapp described Christian slaves as good believers who seemed to have a kind and affectionate nature, a great capacity for love, and a docile and imitative manner, which made them accept the religious ideas presented to them. His letter made clear that he wanted people in the North to know that slaves' religious needs were not only cared for, but that most slaves were exceptional Christians who exhibited many of the best Christian virtues. He made sure to include that white Southerners were perfectly capable and concerned with bettering and supporting the spread of the Gospel to their enslaved people.","Much of what Dexter Clapp had to say on the state of slave Christianity was true, although he described some of it in a very condescending and insulting way, which was indicative of the feelings many white Southerners had towards slaves. He was right in saying that there were many people, missionaries and ordinary folk alike, who saw the importance of sharing the Gospel with slaves. With the rise of Protestantism and the Great Revival in the 1830's, many missionaries made it their work to preach to slaves. Many slaves did respond to message for several reasons, though not as Clapp said: because they had an imitative manner that would make them accept anything presented to them. Although many white Southern Christians claimed dominance over their slaves, slaves could feel equal before God. It also strengthened their families and communities, which was vital to keep their society together during the terrible conditions of slavery. Also, the idea of an equal Heaven was central to the hope that maintained many slaves throughout their lives. Christianity gave slaves freedom to participate in white churches or in their own churches, where they had the freedom to hear their own preachers and socialize with fellow enslaved Christians. Even white men who heard black preachers, said they could not find more enthusiastic ministers or more emotional and genuine church members anywhere. However, some slaveholders feared that religion would cause slaves to rebel, and these whites used the Bible to justify slavery. However, other masters may have truly cared about the salvation of their bondsmen and encouraged them to be Christians. The patronizing way Clapp spoke of the imitative slaves in Georgia was indicative of the opinion many whites had about white supremacy and supposed black infantile nature, but they could not have been more wrong. Although Clapp spoke condescendingly of the docile and imitative nature of the slave, he did not know that slaves often met in secret for their own prayer groups and sermons, where they strongly addressed issues other than obedience to their masters. They discussed freedom and prayed for it, and they sang and danced, and gave way to the feeling of the Spirit. While whites may have seen slaves as docile and meek people who whites actively converted, slaves used their religion and its spread, to create new hope and a stronger culture than ever for African Americans across the South."],"display_date":"May 1, 1846 - May 30, 1846","search_date":"1846-05-15","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2201,"title":"Slave and Master Cross Ocmulgee River\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Robert Anderson was just a young boy when he became a house servant in a Liberty County plantation home. He cleaned the knives, swept the floors, and later tended to the sheep, cows, and hogs. Robert's mistress thought a great deal of him and kept him around the house as much as possible. In Robert's words his mistress felt that nothing went right if I [Anderson] did not have something to do with it. His mistress even allowed him to be taught how to read until she found out this was against the law. His place in the household was one of a very responsible and dependable slave, and this influenced him later in life. When Robert was close twenty years old, his master, Dr. Anderson, decided to move to Glynn County, Georgia. Robert decided to go with him even thought it was hard for him to leave his home. However, it did not seem that he was forced to leave, because he stated in his own autobiography that he went with Dr. Anderson because the doctor was his master and they thought a great deal of one another. An episode that shed light on at least one aspect of their relationship was when they were traveling across the Ocmulgee River. The ferryman struck Dr. Anderson's horse and they argued for a bit and then left the ferry. When they got off, Dr. Anderson asked Robert what he would have done if the ferryman had struck him [Dr. Anderson], instead of his horse. Robert replied vigorously that he would have knocked the ferryman into the water. His master replied thankfully, and pledged that since they were in a strange county now he would make sure to also defend Robert whenever necessary. He firmly stated he would not let anybody take advantage of Robert. Thus on the banks of the river, they pledged themselves to one another and remained so until he [Dr. Anderson] departed this life.","It may seem surprising that a slave and his master seemed truly fond of one another, when in many cases slavery was brutal and did not seem to have a warm, emotional side to it. However, it is important to remember that many masters told themselves it was their duty to take care of their slaves and to be fatherly caretakers. Also, it is important to remember that Robert, and other house slaves, were in close proximity to their masters for most of the day, if not night. This obviously led to some sort of bond, though unequal, to their master and mistress. White women and children across the South often became very attached to their household slaves- people who cleaned for them, nursed them, and raised them. Field slaves often would not have enjoyed this privileged or warmer relationship with their masters. Even though the slave-master relationship was in no way equal, and whites would not like to admit it: both masters and slaves (especially house slaves or slaves on smaller plantations) depended on one another, and were more intimate than one would guess. Both Dr. Anderson and Robert probably felt safer together with someone they had known for decades, since they were in a strange new county. Of course their relationship was imbalanced, as all master-slave relationships were, but it was obvious in many cases that slaves were a form of comfort to their masters. Many slaveholders felt that their slaves were their own people and sometimes had a degree of sentimental feelings towards them. Many whites felt that they really knew what was best for their slaves. Slave-owners often defined themselves by their slaves and whether this brought about a semi-good or bad relationship, it brought out a relationship nonetheless. No matter how unequal the relationship was and no matter how rare it was for slaves and masters to have this affection for one another, his fondness for his master and his master's apparent fondness for Robert made a lasting impression on the future Reverend Robert Anderson for the rest of his life. He was not the only slave in the South who had a more positive relationship with his master than many people would have believed was possible, but it is still important to remember the brutal aspects of slavery, and that even these positive relationships were still not equal or just."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":1836,"lat":31.0887336961,"lng":-81.4509546531,"zoom":9,"place":"GLYNN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2245,"title":"The Art of Snuff-Taking\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-29","end_date":"1835-01-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Surveying Jacksonville society, Leigh Hunt saw humor in the consumption of tobacco. Men of all classes, of all shapes and sizes, employed distinctively bizarre methods of using tobacco. Inhaling dry tobacco powder seems simple enough, but the means to that end varied upon the artistic originality of the southern man. Some gentlemen were quite convulsive, propelling the powder upward into their nostril and shaking their bodies violently as it entered their systems, while others had a polished demeanor, a smooth relaxation marking their snuff-taking. There were those that liked a fast, sharp movement, and those who enjoyed the experience and refinement that accompanied the act. The mode of their consumption depended on what they hoped to gain from the snuff: public attention or tobacco sensation. For all, however, the thread that bound them was that snuff-taking was, or at least appeared to be, one of the more routine and fundamental acts in their daily lives.","Dr. Johnson was a particularly unique snuff-taker. He was of the kind of tobacco user that had a luxuriance of gesture and a lavishness of supply that would often overflow onto his neck cloth. If there are species of snuff-takers, Dr. Johnson was of the long-armed variety. He stretched forth his arm, as a snuff taking elephant might his trunk, having already pinched the powder from his waistcoat, and shook his head, nose, and snuff all at once. His eyebrows even lifted up to clear space for the onset of the mild tobacco effects. Once finished, he straightened himself, proclaiming victory over the precious moment, and let out a great bah for all onlookers to hear.","Hunt's journal entry published in the Jacksonville Courier describes in great detail an old custom of southern men, imported from the French through London as part of a stream of European cultural influences. The larger narrative here, of tobacco consumption in the South and the world, is the story of the founding of this nation. John Rolfe, leader of the Jamestown settlement, was driven by English investors to make a profit on tobacco. The first shipment of the golden weed arrived in England in 1617 and by 1650, one fourth of English people smoked everyday. Sailors enjoyed tobacco because of the mild high it induced and demand exploded across continental Europe.","Supply raced to catch up and tobacco cultivation expanded outward from Jamestown into Virginia and North Carolina. The New World's economy even used the cash crop as currency and record of debt; Emanuel Driggus, a free black farmer in Myne Owne Ground, once sold a horse for 2000 pounds of tobacco and was fined 475 pounds by the county court in 1672. Small farmers and large planters alike grew tobacco and its lasting impact is in the way it fueled the rise of the plantation agriculture system and African slave trade. Although it would be supplanted by King Cotton as the major cash crop of the South in the 1800's, tobacco consumption, and its manifestation in the custom of snuff-taking, was most influential in the establishment of the early southern economy, its trading partners and local barter markets, and the spread of slavery across the region."],"display_date":"January 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-29","locations":[{"id":1324,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2278,"title":"Brown&#39;s Speech to Congress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-06-17","end_date":"1844-06-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Looking out over the twenty eighth Congress, Mr. A.V. Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee. Just as with Maine, Missouri, and other territories admitted during the period, politicians sought to maintain a tenuous balance of power. Admission of Florida became more attractive as the application for statehood of a free territory, Iowa, appeared on the horizon and came up in 1846. Less than a year after Brown's speech, on March 3, 1845, Florida became the twenty seventh state of the Union."],"display_date":"June 17, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2283,"title":"The Richest Slave \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1846-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the fall of 1845, caterpillars destroyed the cotton crop in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, where Solomon Northup was enslaved. His master, along with other planters, sent their slaves, including Northup, south to St. Mary's Parish to hire themselves out on the sugar plantations where labor was needed and wages were high. Northup was hired out to a Judge Turner who lived on the Bayou Salle. After being given several different tasks, Northup was put in the sugarhouse. He acted in the capacity of driver; he was given a whip and told to use it on anyone who was idle. If he failed to do so, he would be whipped himself. The process of sugar making continued day and night; Northup had no regular times to rest and got little sleep. ","One advantage to working in the sugarhouse was that Northup was paid for some of his work. Louisiana custom mandated that a slave retain whatever compensation he may obtain for services performed on Sundays; this money allowed him to buy necessary articles such as utensils to cook with. To ask for these seemingly everyday and inconsequential things would have ended in laughter, a kick, or even a whipping from the master according to Northup's autobriography, <em>Twelve Years A Slave. Narrative Of Solomon Northup.</em> In the book, Northup also points out that however injurious to the morals, it [was] certainly a blessing to the physical condition of the slave, to be permitted to break the Sabbath and be able to purchase everyday items. Northup earned 10 in Sabbath money. He added to this by playing his violin at a party given by one of Judge Turner's neighbors. He ended up with 17, which he took great pleasure in counting. He would spend his time dreaming of the water pails, pocket knives, new shoes and coats and hats and other everyday items that he would be able to buy. He also took great pleasure in being the wealthiest slave on the Bayou Boeuf when he returned home in January of 1846."," On a sugar plantation, such as Northup worked on, labor was almost continuous. Planting began in January and ended in March; cultivation began in March and lasted till July. Farm chores were done until grinding began in October. During the grinding season a mill would run almost nonstop from early Monday morning until noon on Saturday. It required work and constant supervision, and those chosen both to accomplish and oversee the task, like Northup, got little to no rest. Sometimes slaves were even required to work on the Sabbath, but, as in the case of Northup, slaves were usually paid for the work they did on this day usually reserved for rest. ","Throughout the South, planters of all types of crops often hired slaves from other plantations to provide extra help. Slaves' owners, as in Northup's case, sometimes hired out their slaves to other planters; in this situation the slave's master would usually take at least some of the money the slave earned in the job. Slave owners also found it profitable to hire slaves out to industry, such the lumber industry, or to the state for public works projects. Sometimes slaves were able to hire themselves out, meaning they could keep their own earnings. After the slave received his or her money, then that slave was free to spend it. Slaves often spent what little money they were able to make on providing themselves and their families with extra food and clothing. They could also buy small luxuries such as furniture.","Northup had not grown up having to spend endless hours working fervently in a hot sugar-grinding mill, nor did he grow up having to work on Sundays or play his violin at parties just to earn money to buy the few necessities of life. Northup had been born a free man but was kidnapped in 1841 while visiting Washington, D.C. He was drugged, threatened with death, and then put on a boat to New Orleans where a slave dealer sold him into slavery. His story, though unusual, was not unique. Not all African Americans sold in the slave yards were born into slavery; some where free men and women who had been kidnapped and sold South where they would be unable to escape or solicit help. Free African Americans were kidnapped from all over the United States in the nineteenth century. They were kidnapped from within the South. Three generations from one free African American family were kidnapped from Point Coupee, Louisiana, and sold in New Orleans. They were kidnapped in the Midwest; a free African American named John Merry from Illinois was arrested in St. Louis and sold in New Orleans. Northup himself was from New York in the North. Some of these kidnapped men, including both Northup and Merry, were able to get friends from the North to help them win back their freedom, but others did not always have friends who could help. Whether or not they were able to escape, they had to grow accustomed, for at least a little while, to being a piece of property who had been bought and paid for and who had to struggle though long hours of hard work for which they usually received no pay."],"display_date":"1845 - 1846","search_date":"1845-12-31","locations":[{"id":5713,"lat":29.8296521317,"lng":-91.9512085468,"zoom":9,"place":"ST MARY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2288,"title":"Mortgaging Property  \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-04-08","end_date":"1838-04-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In April of 1838, George Guion wrote to the Thibodeauxville Branch of Union Bank of Louisiana asking for a loan of 5,000 in addition to a 10,000 mortgage he already had from the bank on his plantation and slaves. Guion wrote that his plantation had increased in both size and productivity since his first application for a loan due to the fencing of his land, the erection of a cotton gin and a gristmill, and from the cutting of ditches. As security for the additional loan he offered to the bank his plantation and sixteen slaves whose ages ranged from sixteen months to fifty years. It is unknown if the bank granted his loan. ","Banks in Louisiana were encouraged by the state to make large loans to planters in order promote agriculture and commerce. The state mandated that banks open branches in plantation areas and make a certain number of mortgage loans, specifying the geographical distribution of the loans around the state. Although collateralized transactions usually accounted for a small number of credit transactions, slaves were the most popular form of collateral for those short-term and long-term loans that required collateral. For example, slaves accounted for 80 percent of the securities offered in recorded mortgages in antebellum East Feliciana Parish in Louisiana. Slaves could also be used as collateral for purchasing shares in Louisiana's investment banks. ","In the South, slaves were property-they could be bought, sold and transported to any location that allowed slavery. As property, their owners could use slaves when they needed loans. The income stream, or the prospective value of a slave on the present market, influenced the amount each slave was mortgaged for; thus a slave's value was measured in cash. The mortgages usually consisted of recognition of a debt by the debtor and a description of the debt and the property being mortgaged and the time and means by which the mortgaged property had been purchased. Banks all over the South allowed slaveholders to use their slaves as collateral. The Bank of Charleston in South Carolina, founded in 1834, accepted at least five hundred and twenty nine slaves as collateral for mortgages and loans in the years before the Civil War. They also confiscated and owned an unknown number of these slaves when loans were defaulted upon.

It is unlikely he was capable of much heroism as he was also mixed up in the murder of two white whiskey sellers in the area. It is unclear if Small was a slave on the Marchand plantation or another plantation or if he was a free man. ","Trist found Isidore's betrayal of his mistress with whom he had grown up the most disturbing part of the confession. He thought that since Isidore had been raised together with Mrs. Harris and since she had always been kind to him this made his villainy even worse than Small's. ","In expressing his distress that Isidore could murder a woman whom he had grown up with and who had apparently always been kind to him, Trist was showing that he, like slaveholders throughout the South, subscribed to the doctrine of paternalism. Paternalism was a defense of slavery in which slaveholders claimed that they treated their slaves well and took care of them by providing them with food, clothing lodging, and religion. Slaveholders thought slavery to be a type of parent/child relationship where the slaveholder took care of the slave and the slave was grateful and content to be looked after. ","But Mrs. Harris' murder shows an instance where African Americans were obviously not content and thus showed an active resistance to their enslavement. According to historian Kenneth Stampp, slaves thought of their enslavement in terms of labor extortion and a lack of control over their own time and labor. They would play along with the slaveholder's illusions that they as slaves were helpless, because not to do so might anger their owner and end in some form of punishment by the owner. Slaves struggled against their forced servitude in many ways. Some were careless in their work. Some slaves sabotaged themselves to make themselves unfit for work. Stampp reports on one Kentucky slave who would purposely make himself sick by overdosing on medicines he found in his master's medicine chest. One of the more extreme steps a slave could take to resist enslavement was to run away. This was a dangerous step; runaway slaves usually were caught and brought back to the plantations where they were usually publicly punished as a warning to other potential runaways. A most extreme form of resistance was murder. Slaves murdered both overseers and owners for different reasons. Usually it was because the slave felt he had been treated badly or punished unfairly. According to Stampp, violence was usually only adopted by the most extremely discontented of the slaves. Many states had Black Codes to deal with slave violence. Louisiana's Black Code ordered that a slave be given a trial; if convicted, the slave was either sent to prison or, as was most common in the South, executed.

They first traveled by railroad, then steamboat, until arriving at a point twenty miles down the river from the home they were to visit. It looked as though they had a long row ahead f them. But it turned out that their host had sent slaves to pull the boat along the canal. The slaves were put into harnesses like horses and began to drag the boat, canal-boat style, for the first ten miles of the journey. Lisa worried a little about the slaves working and toiling too hard but soon saw that that it was fine fun for them and that there was nothing they enjoyed more. She then lay back to relax and reflected on the beautiful day upon the bayou, enjoying how black moss hung in festoons from the cypress and oak trees, giving one the sense of being beyond [the] reach of a human being.","Lisa's solitude was short-lived, however. Her brother George decided to take the opportunity of a relaxing day on the bayou to engage in alligator hunting. George actually sho[t] and kill[ed] five alligators, the largest of which measure[d] twelve feet George was thus quite distinguished and applauded by his traveling companions. Lisa wrote to her mother in New York that she wished that her little brother had been there to see the excitement. The boat in which Lisa and her brother traveled down the canal on was most likely a keelboat. Keelboats originally were used to transport goods up and downriver, but in the late eighteenth century, planters began to used keelboats as pleasure crafts in coastal areas of the South. These boats usually had pavilions for the planter and his family and were usually oar-propelled or dragged by slaves. The boats were convenient; they could be used in shallow water because they only drew two to three feet when fully loaded. They were also more maneuverable because of their narrow beam and because they could be poled or hauled.","Hunting for sport was popular with both men and women in the South. Although alligator hunting was mostly confined to the lower coastal regions of the South-places such as South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana-other types of hunting flourished all over the South from Maryland and Virginia to Louisiana. Fashionable, less-serious, hunters, both men and women, usually only hunted fox and deer, while more serious hunters preyed on bears, fowl, rabbits, possums, and wild turkeys. Hunting for sport was usually the game of the upper class in the South. Most hunts were conducted on horseback, riding with hounds. When men went alligator hunting, they went on foot, but still brought with them packs of trained dogs. Throughout the South, slavery made possible this culture of upper-class leisure that Lisa and George enjoyed. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, the quality of life that upper class Southerners enjoyed rested upon the labor of servants. The time that upper-class men and women spent reading, visiting friends, going hunting and on other various leisurely activities depended upon the slaves' performing all of the basic house and field work. Historian Walter Johnson says that slavery enabled a white woman [to be able to] skate lightly across the surface of daily exigency, her own composure unscathed by the messy process required to produce the pleasing tableau of her own life. Johnson also points out that the ability to own enough slaves to have this lifestyle is what distinguished the upper class from the lower classes. To be able to afford enough slaves so that one's wife only had to worry about leisure and gentility was something that marked out the class hierarchy and was something that men of wealth often made a point of telling their friends to emphasize personal wealth, wealth based upon the enslavement of other human beings."],"display_date":"March 22, 1845","search_date":"1845-03-22","locations":[{"id":5544,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2313,"title":"African Americans Drinking during Church Service\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-01","end_date":"1846-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The white population of Culpeper County, Virginia was dismayed when their church services were inexcusably disrupted by the boisterous activities of some African Americans. As a petition to the State Legislature, drafted by a number of the county's white citizens in 1846, states, their worshipping services are of late so interrupted by drinking, particularly by Negroes on the Sabbath, that they will be under the necessity of discontinuing their religious meetings...unless they can be protected by the interference of the Legislature. While it was already illegal to sell alcohol to slaves, the residents of Culpeper apparently were having trouble enforcing the law. "," It appeared to the petitioners that peddlers claiming to sell melons and cakes were actually selling liquor. Additionally, much to the disappointment of the white population of the county, white people too, [were] professing to be engaged in what they call the innocent business of buying and selling melons and cakes...but in that situation it [was] easy to introduce spirits. The residents requested that the state legislature put a stop to all sorts of trade at religious meetings and professed that they cheerfully and willingly trust[ed] in the justice and wisdom of that body to provide a remedy."," This episode of apparently disorderly behavior on the part of blacks and the attempts to control their disorderly manners convey the notion that many whites felt it was their duty to control the natural unruly behavior of African Americans. Melvin Ely conveys this sentiment when he states that whites felt blacks could only live in a civilized society if they were watched over and guided by the moral superiority of whites. Therefore, it was up to the white citizens of Culpeper County to curtail the economic activity that encouraged the disorderly conduct and upsetting the balance that so delicately permeated life in slave holding society. The conduct of the slaves in drunkenly disturbing the worship service reveals that the white residents of the county did not have as much control over the behavior of the black members of the community as they might have wanted to believe. Additionally, the petition revealed that whites were participating in the moral debauchery as well. In fact, they apparently facilitated it.

Many went to the free states of Ohio or Pennsylvania. However, several petitions made by the residents of Loudoun County reveal that the newly freed blacks were often inclined to stay in Virginia. As the petitions disclose, they received both support and some resistance from their neighbors in Loudoun County.","In 1848, thirty-nine petitioners requested the help of the state legislature in permitting William Watson to remain in Virginia. Watson had been emancipated by his owner and had proved a man of good character, of industrious habits, charged with the support of large family. Additionally, the petition stated that Watson was a convenient and useful person to [the] community in the capacity of a day laborer. A similar petition, signed by 93 residents, was written in Leesburg in 1850, requesting that Harriet Cook, a free black, be permitted to live in the state. The document stated that she possessed a high character and was a valuable member of Society. The petitioners elaborated on her value to their lives when they explained that she provided laundry services to many in the town and her loss would be a great inconvenience.","Despite these petitions, not every citizen in Loudoun County supported the residence of William Watson and Harriet Cook. A 1850 petition asked that the two free blacks be removed from the county and that the law should serve as the remedy in such cases where it ought to be in the city and county courts. Twelve residents of the county put petition. As pointed out by the historian Joshua Rothman, Virginia law required free blacks emancipated after 1806 to leave the state permanently within one year of manumission, unless they received a petition from the state legislature. While some fought to keep their families together and retain the already mangled pieces of their lives, Rothman states others made the difficult move and left a state that didn't want them anymore. That didn't want them while they were free. As the above-mentioned petitions demonstrate, some freed slaves received help from their white neighbors in their fight to stay in the state. This situation reveals, that in race relations, whites did not act like whites were supposed to act and blacks did not act like blacks were supposed to act, when personal relationships complicated the idea of stark racial divides. However, while some in Loudoun County thought the presence of Billy Watson and Harriet Cook proved good, in fact somewhat essential, for community life, others thought it necessary that they leave."],"display_date":"1848 - 1850","search_date":"1849-07-01","locations":[{"id":14002,"lat":39.0907154711,"lng":-77.6357306744,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUDOUN, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2338,"title":"Alexander Allen&#39;s Essay on Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Alexander Allen was asked to write an essay on the Advantages and Disadvantages of Slavery at Franklin College, Alabama, which he attended during the late 1830s and early 1840s, his answers were based upon the society in which he was immersed for all of his life. First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2340,"title":"John Dewery in Prison\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-07","end_date":"1836-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Dewery, a bright mulatto...nineteen or twenty years old, found himself in a precarious situation. As he was sitting in the Clark County Jail in Alabama on January 7, 1836, the Mobile Commercial Register published an announcement about his capture and arrest as an escaped slave. This was problematic because he swore in vain that he was a freed person. Nevertheless, the paper reported that if his owner would not come to reclaim his property, he will be delt with as the law directs.","If this young mulatto boy was currently or at any point a slave, that means he was the child of a sexual relationship across the color line in which an enslaved mother was the partner of some white male. This is evident because southern state laws established that children of any mixed relationship would follow the status of their mother, regardless of who their father might be, keeping them enslaved on the plantation. Of course, this gave white male slave-owners the opportunity to freely engage in elicit sexual relations with their female slaves without fear of the repercussions of unwanted, illegitimate children as these children would still be classified as their slaves. According to Joshua Rothman, such occurrences fed to the complexities and contradictions of a southern society founded on racial domination-which some sexual relationships could only serve to reinforce-and alternately undermined by interracial sex.","On the other hand, it is possible that this young boy was not a slave nor was enslaved ever in his past. Because of the maternally-inherited status-which meant slaves who had a white father were still born as slaves-on which the southern plantation functioned, some mulattos were free while some, born of enslaved mothers, were still slaves. In other words, an individual's physical appearance essentially gave no indication of being free or enslaved. Therefore, many slave traders kidnapped and sold free blacks who were not slaves at all. Notably during the fall months, when planters had money from the sale of their crops, slave traders in Alabama took such illicit action in order to make their own profit. Within the interstate slave trade, numerous free blacks and mulattos were arrested under the assumption that they were escaped slaves and then allowed to be sold simply because traders could presumably legitimize this through the color of their skin. As John waited in his prison cell in Clarke County, his fate was more than likely to be sold in order for the county to pay for jail fees-an embodiment of unpredictable and often times tragic outcome of sex across the color line."],"display_date":"January 7, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-07","locations":[{"id":77,"lat":31.6619891322,"lng":-87.8428758708,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2341,"title":"Sylvia, the Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-09-30","end_date":"1836-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1836, Sylvia, about twenty years of age, of common size, very likely and almost black, was sold from her plantation in Conecuh County, Alabama to the plantation of Thomas L. Stark in Washington County. Perhaps she was separated from her husband. Perhaps she left behind a child. Whatever the circumstances, Sylvia decided to run away. After several months with no sign of Sylvia, her owner finally decided to make a more public announcement. On September 30 of that same year, the Mobile County Register published a 10 reward pending the return of this runaway slave. Sylvia's rightful owner expected her to return to her former plantation in Conecuh County and whomever she missed there.","Across the South, the domestic slave trade daily uprooted slaves from their homes and dropped them into some foreign land without regard for their personal well-being. Of all the interstate slave sales leading up to the Civil War, twenty-five percent destroyed first marriages and fifty percent destroyed nuclear families. Essentially, slaves were property, and property could be bought and sold at will-whatever was economically profitable. With this in mind, the families of slaves were always in danger of being separated.","Sylvia's new master, Thomas L. Stark, valued the young girl enough that he provided a reward for her return. Slaves were vital to the livelihood of the southern plantation owner. As William Rogers explains, slavery was a crucial part of the Cotton Kingdom in Alabama and inherently tied to the economic success of planters as their most valuable asset. Therefore, Mr. Stark valued Sylvia as one of the highest commodities in his fortune-one that he could not let run away.","Surely, Sylvia knew that punishment was awaiting her upon her return. In Alabama, most small infractions were handled on the plantations, while more serious crimes were handled within the legal system. Essentially, corporal punishment was a way for white southerners to demonstrate their power and keep the system of slavery functioning to their advantage. Even though slaves were property, they were still people who needed disciplining to keep within the lines of the owners' will.

The Forwood family was generally in sufficient health, despite a fever here and there. However, in this letter, Sam chose to include the conditions of his slaves. He wrote, My family is in good health except one negro woman and a little negro boy over two years old. The black woman had been plagued by a slight fever, and the young slave boy had broken a bone rough-housing with some of the other slave children. Following this mention, Sam continued his letter with the normal discussion of his cotton crop and other business around Clark County.","This is not an exception in the history of southern slavery. Slave owners often included slaves as a part of their household. As Edward Ayers points out, in most instances, masters and slaves mutually cared for one another, and masters would grieve for slaves as a member for the family. Because the idea of family was so important in the southern Christian culture, masters frequently included their slaves in their notion of their family unit. The inclusion would, in theory, civilize the slaves with Christian influences because slaves who respected their masters-as children who respect their fathers-would never seek to harm them. Furthermore, the slaves' own family units, like those of their masters, kept a degree of humanity and happiness instilled in the plantation dynamics.","Moreover, slaves were the livelihood of southern plantation owners, and thus owners were necessarily concerned about the health of their slaves.

Clay, a U.S. senator from Alabama, was in a feeling of intense anxiety concerning the upcoming election of 1841. Lewis, an Alabama representative, was getting rather annoyed. At Clay's request, Lewis finally sat down to write a letter on January 18, 1841, to Benjamin Fitzpatrick, his brother-in-law and wealthy planter living in Elmore County. Fitzpatrick had been recently nominated by the Democratic Party for governorship of Alabama.","Clay was anxious to talk with Fitzpatrick about his nomination and the election. Unlike Lewis, Clay believed that the prospects for the Democratic Party were cause for distress. The current President, Martin Van Buren, did not enjoy a very peaceful term. The Panic of 1837 burdened his office greatly, leading to an economic depression that was only exacerbated by crop failures and low cotton prices. Furthermore, he refused to annex Texas and opposed extending slavery into the territories, angering many southern Democrats. These issues weakened his chances of reelection. Lewis found a simple answer to this-the Democratic Party should just stay quiet and firm, holding off on any announcement of the Presidential candidate to prevent the resurgence of the same issues. As far as their opponent was concerned, he stated, The only struggle is the secret one going on among the Whigs.","Yet, Lewis was wrong. William Henry Harrison, the presidential candidate of the Whig party, was victorious in the final election. On a local state level, the Democratic Party still retained a strong hold in Alabama. This was because many slaveholders were able to associate abolitionist sentiments with Old Harrison. The electorate of Alabama chose the very popular Fitzpatrick and reelected Clay and Lewis to their respective positions. Nevertheless, the Whigs were not as weak as Lewis had imagined. According to James Volo, they brilliantly campaigned in the first modern political effort in history. Even though Van Buren won Alabama's electoral votes, the Democrats certainly had reason to worry on the national scale. Harrison won 234 of the electoral votes, with Van Buren only winning sixty. Lewis seemed calm and collected in the months preceding the election, blind to the future success of the Whig Party and the imminent split of the Democratic Party that would come only a decade later.

She enjoyed pleasant conversation as well as the beautiful surroundings. She made note of the impressive collection of books, and in particular the various curiosities displayed throughout the parlor. Holley's friends, Mr. and Mrs. Wharton, boasted all sorts of fascinating relics, once owned by famous figures in Mexican history. Holley wrapped up the account of her delightful afternoon by recognizing Mr. Wharton as a cultured gentleman and Mrs. Wharton as all that a lady should be. ","In the early stages of Texas colonization, most of the colonists were like Holley and the Whartons: ladies and gentlemen from the American South. Being southerners, they brought with them several aspects of southern life and culture. One of these was slavery and the way of life it provided. Domestic slaves took the burdens of household work off of slaveholding ladies, supplying them with an abundance of leisure time. Having free time enabled Holley to receive a thorough education. Her education made her interested in rare editions of books and figures in Mexican history. Holley appreciated the finer things in life and put emphasis on the importance of being a gentleman or lady. ","The ladies of the antebellum South revealed an important aspect of southern class hierarchy. In his book Soul by Soul, Walter Johnson describes the white upper class as a society made by slaves. Wives of slaveholders demonstrated this particularly well because the mark of a gentile lady was the leisure time she had to engage in pleasantries.

On the eve of the family's journey to visit relatives in Tennessee an abolition crew had invaded the Eppes's plantation. According to Fannie, Susan's older sister, some white men, who had no business about the place, had come in the night and hidden away. Susan wanted to know more but Fannie refused to say anything else about that night. Due to the uprising in that night, Dr. Eppes did not accompany the family on their trip. Instead, he remained at the family plantation to keep watch. It was not until three days later when Susan pretending to be asleep on a couch, learned more. Her mother and uncle, having not seen her in the study, began to discuss a letter just received from Dr. Eppes. The men in the abolition crew had been on horseback, and according to Dr. Eppes, would be severely dealt with if they returned. Susan's Uncle Daniel stated in a serious tone that these abolitionists are everywhere through the South. Sooner or later they will make trouble for us. It was at that moment that Susan cried out in a voice full of concern and curiosity, Oh, Uncle Daniel, please tell me all about it? However, before Susan could glean any more information on the subject Fannie escorted her to bed. ","By 1855 the possibility of a plantation raid by an abolitionist crew had become a real fear for many large slave owners throughout the south. This episode is a prime example how abolition groups were growing increasingly bolder in their actions across the South. Vanished were the days when only those in the upper South had to be wary of such people. Abolitionists by 1855 were venturing deeper south into such states as Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Rather than relying on mass mailing antislavery materials to plantation owners, abolitionists were penetrating the South seeking to directly aid slaves in escaping their masters. Encouragement for this kind of action was perpetuated by abolitionist orators like Gerrit Smith and Henry Highland Garnet. In his speeches Smith urged Northern abolitionist to go south and help them. Many Northerners agreed that helping slaves escape would play an important role in the attack and eventual crumbling of slavery. However, proslavery southern whites saw these rescues in a different light. While abolitionists saw slave owners as stealing slaves' very lives, slaveholders saw abolitionist crews as stealing their property. From the southern perspective slave rescues were an outlet of violent northern aggression against the peaceful South. Proslavery advocates saw northerners who participated in slave raids as vile fiends, emissaries of mischief and worse than thieves, robbers, or murderers. In response, whenever a slave rescuer was captured, agitated mobs would gather and insist that the captured parties be punished severely, whether legally or illegally. Outspoken southerners asserted that if northerners continued to interfere in the affairs of slave owners there would be violence. This increasing fear of abolitionist parties added to southern sectionalism further driving the country apart."],"display_date":"June 6, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-06","locations":[{"id":1395,"lat":30.4456509268,"lng":-84.292206157,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2404,"title":"A Happy Band of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-02-03","end_date":"1839-02-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["An incident at the Wharf of Mr. McKinnie and Mr. Williams gave Frances Sheridan something to write critically about in his journal. Here he saw a settler arriving in Texas with a group of slaves. The large band of black enslaved men and women moved about without cares; they laughed and joke as they ate their biscuits. A man only identified as the entertainer of the group created comic relief when he whipped a donkey who in turn kicked the hind quarters of a very fat man. The slaves laughed uncontrollably, spewing out pieces of biscuit and some nearly choking because they were laughing so hard. ","As the train left the wharf, Sheridan could not help but pity the jovial slaves who were ignorant of what lay ahead of them. Go your ways, he wrote, go your ways my happy thoughtless party - happy because thoughtless, the time may not be far distant... when your quips & cranks will be turned into tears, wails & groans. Sheridan predicted the break up of the happy group as members would be sold as property to repay debts and satisfy the needs of their master.","Texas's close proximity to Louisiana and the New Orleans slave market, the largest in the country, made Sheridan's predictions viable. Walter Johnson poignantly describes the slave trade as, the story of separated lovers and broken families, of widows, widowers, and orphans left in the wake of the trade, only, perhaps, to be sold themselves at a later date. The interstate slave trade separated families and friends all the time; there was no reason to think it would be different for this group of slaves. Being sold to other slave owners was a fact of life for slaves, and Sheridan believed the thought of this should have sobered up the band of slaves and made them more serious and reserved. ","Like many other white people of this time, Sheridan depicted the band of slaves with condescension. There were conventional topics that white writers focused on when describing slaves: 'the skin, the odor, the dialect, the shuffle,' and even the endearing 'imbecile good nature.' Sheridan primarily focused on the nature of the black slaves; they were funny, loud, and grotesque. Sheridan could not look past these things and see the vibrant African American culture as a way for slaves to deal with their enslavement. Sheridan's entry shows that he had a good knowledge of the slave trade an the hardships slaves face, but that he was ignorant of black culture and how it related to their condition as slaves.

The townsmen that entered requested that Sterne issue a warrant for the arrest of William Simons. They informed Sterne that Simons had tried to kill a free African American blacksmith named William Goyens. Sterne did as the men asked and then did not hear about Goyens or Simons for the rest of the evening. The next day Sterne learned that the gunshot wound Goyens received had not been fatal and that he was expected to recover. This episode related in Sterne's diary over a two day period is interesting because of the editorial inserts Sterne made. On August 27, 1842, when he first heard about the attempted murder, he interjected, Several People in Town all very merry. Then on August 28, he said that the wound Goyens received was not enough to do any good. These comments Sterne made are telling of the mindset toward Goyens. Sterne made no record of any personal grievances with Goyens, but it is clear that he was not on good terms with him, nor was he popular in town. This attitude may have stemmed from Goyens's position as a free black man and slave owner.","The feeling of Texans toward free blacks during the Texas Republic was one of fear and distrust. According to Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen, Many Texans feared that the existence of a free black population would undermine the institution of slavery. To guard against free blacks living in Texas and being a bad influence on slaves, Texas required free blacks to obtain permission from Congress to live in Texas. During the early 1840s measures to prevent free black occupation of Texas increased. President Mirabeau B. Lamar gave the order that all free blacks had to leave Texas by January 1, 1842. Luckily for the free black population, Sam Houston repealed this law upon his reelection in 1842 and allowed free blacks to remain in Texas. ","The shooting of Goyens occurred right in the time period of the early 1840s when Lamar had decided to crack down on the free blacks in Texas. The bad feelings of white Texans toward the repeal of Lamar's law could be the reason for the joy of the townspeople at the shooting and Sterne's disappointment at the murder being unsuccessful. To add to their dislike was that Goyens owned some slaves himself. The presence of a free black man was bad enough, but the presence of a free black slave owner would have been too much for some. Goyens showed that there were opportunities for blacks outside of slavery, a notion dangerous to a society built on the enslaving of black men and women.

The diary of Dr. Walter Wade proved that even in the mid-nineteenth century that this concept was not a foreign one. A large percentage of his journal was dedicated to a documentation of his private medical records. In a February 21, 1848 entry, Wade described his Monday night visit to a woman named Sarah. Wade devoted few words to the entry, but his impact was nonetheless powerful. He succinctly stated that, Sarah had an abortion at 3 mos. Wade provided the reader with sparse details about Sarah, but he did mention that the terminated pregnancy had consisted of twins. However, he was unable to learn the gender of the pair, presumably because the pregnancy was not far enough advanced. Wade maintained a business-like and professional tone throughout the passage; one can only assume that this detached air his writing emanated was reflected in his actions as a physician."," An individual's livelihood was undoubtedly unstable in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of, High infant mortality rate and tragic loss of loved ones to disease or accident in the prime of life, according to historians James and Dorothy Volo death became an accepted and inexorable fact of existence. As a whole, individuals found it easier to resign themselves to the reality of mortality, and doctors, who were already required to uphold an air of formality concerning their patients, were no different. Doctors undoubtedly practiced abortion in the antebellum South, but because it was a sensitive and often taboo subject, it is difficult to find example of it recorded. Some instances of abortion have been discovered among the records of slave women who were either unable to care for their children due to the harsh demands of their required work or whose children were often sold by avaricious masters. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, one woman was forced to watch as her master put all of her infant children up for sale, until, taking matters until her own hands, she decided that she was not going to let her master sell that baby. 'She got up and give it something out of a bottle and purty soon it was dead'. Says Fox-Genovese, these desperate women saw either terminating their pregnancies or killing their own children as a, ... way [to reclaim] it as their own. In a perverse way, infanticide could be seen as a means to give children life. "," There is no way to tell from Wade's brief diary entry what the primary motivation was behind Sarah's decision to abort her babies.

Wesleyan Methodist preacher Jesse McBride had stirred too much controversy among whites and slaves in Guilford County.  Intending to run McBride out of the county, about two-hundred men gathered on May 23, 1851 outside of the church where he would preach that morning.  For six hours McBride had been on the road, not finishing the 18 mile journey to his Liberty Hill congregation outside of Greensboro until a few minutes before noon.  Accounts of the exchange between McBride and the disgruntled locals vary according to source.  The mob leader and slave-owner Hoover blocked McBride from entering the church.  McBride appears to have kept a cool head in the confrontation: he drew upon scriptural resources, he induced his congregation to sing hymns in front of the increasingly frustrated mob, and he conducted his congregation in prayers. Without personal violence or abuse according to the local <em>Greensboro Patriot</em>, but with considerable, drunken man-handling according to McBride's personal account in the abolitionist <em>Liberator</em>, the mob shoved McBride into his carriage.  He rode away.  Sometime immediately thereafter, local powers obtained his pledge in writing to depart Guilford County within a week.  McBride returned to Ohio.  The <em>Liberator</em> published his first account on June 20 and then a more elaborate version on August 15.  The <em>Greensboro Patriot </em>expressed relief and anticipated a return to tranquility in its brief account of the incident.  ","The creed of Wesleyan Methodists involved an antislavery stance, and for this reason many whites no longer tolerated McBride's growing influence among the Christian circles of Guilford and Stokes Counties.  On May 18, Reverend Hines of the Methodist Episcopal Church had stated the deleterious effects of McBride's sermons in a meeting.  Local officials held another meeting in Greensboro on May 20 for the purpose of suppressing abolition agitation.  During the meeting, McBride was implicated directly for interfering with the property rights of local slave-owners.  He had created enemies among nervous slave-holders and among vexed preachers whose congregations were splintering over slavery.","Beginning with zeal in 1831, when William Lloyd Garrison began publishing the <em>Liberator</em>, and gaining controversial attention in the wake of Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion, the Abolition crusade began making its presence felt among slave-holders.  Because Southern churches' policies accommodated slavery, the Methodist Church split in 1844, and supporters of slavery established the Methodist Episcopal Church.  This episode in McBride's career strengthens Donald Matthews' description of the brave extension of the Evangelical ethos beyond the internal life of the believer and into social relationships. McBride's<em> Wesleyan</em> sect of Methodism, which threatened excommunication to those who would not emancipate their slaves within two years, scared slaveholders with its judgmental views.  McBride's brave efforts to nurture an anti-slavery parish illustrate both the active efforts of anti-slavery ideology and the physical resistance these efforts met from pro-slavery interests."],"display_date":"May 18, 1851 - August 15, 1851","search_date":"1851-07-01","locations":[{"id":9489,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2420,"title":"Paternalism, Slaveholders, and the Guilty Conscience","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-02-27","end_date":"1851-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 27, 1851, John M. Folkes wrote a letter in response to a request he had received from a man named Benjamin Drake. In his reply, he addressed Drake's plea for Folkes to surrender a number of his slaves. Throughout the letter, there was a tacit understanding of Drake's financial difficulties; one can assume from Folkes' reply that the end aspiration of Drake's request is purely monetary in nature. However, Folkes was not quick to comply wholly with Drake's wishes. He replied that both the slaves and Drake himself, chose me for their master. He called the slaves in question, a part of his family, and asserted that, they have become indentifide with my family. He goes so far as to name two slaves that he would particularly like to keep, a man named Abram and another individual whose name is illegible. Folkes' letter did not solve what was clearly a complex and hotly contested issue between the two men. But Folkes did show a judicious side and agreed to discuss the matter in person before any further action was taken."," John Folkes was one example of a larger group of slaveholders that emerged in the midst of the slave South. Folkes fought Benjamin Drake's desire to sell his slaves because, he argued, they were not only members of his household, but of his family as well. Folkes' words reflect a growing sentiment among slaveholders in which buyers believed that their participation in the slave market was actually beneficial to the slaves. Slave-buyers had the power to keep family units in tact by purchasing all the members of a slave's family. This paternalism, historian Walter Johnson states, caused slaveholders, to say that they were acting on behalf of the people whom they had bought to act for them. Therefore, in retaining certain family units, buyers believed they were actually doing their slaves a favor. "," From his firm reply to Drake, Folkes clearly ascribed to this sentiment of paternalism, and vehemently wished to retain both his household and the members of his slave family. But in doing so, he also yielded to a certain delusion in thinking that he helped his slaves by any means.

They applauded the satiric criticism as the severest and most truthful against Stowe and her British supporters. The poem was written as if by a British aristocrat who both commends Britain for banishing slavery and yet also foppishly implicated British class differences as equally, if not more, merciless than American slavery.  <em>British</em> peasants, it reads, are not our slaves, and 'tis tickingly pleasant, / To think they have <em>free</em>dom - to die in a ditch The eight stanzas levelled many shocking attacks against British institutions.  For example, the article implied that Britons permitted their women to work in coal shafts on hands and knees without clothes.  One line, which would have particularly resonated in 1853 read, Though Irishmen rot in the fever and famine, / Which we have created- we speak it with pride- / <em>That, if you will calmly and fairly examine</em>, / You'll find they were perfectly free- when they died","    Stowe's novel introduced further turmoil to a tumultuous era of United States History, during which embittered pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions bemoaned the Compromise of 1850.  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants, fleeing the distresses of famine and poverty in Ireland inflated America with visible proof of English oppression.  The North Carolinian editors' concise but harsh attack against Stowe, similar in logic to James Henry Hammond's 1858 Mudsill Theory speech, argues that slavery eliminates the need for downtrodden white peasants in societies.  ","In the larger context of understanding how white Southerners justified slavery, this article exemplifies one method of neutralizing Stowe's potent attacks against slavery.  The <em>Register</em>'s editors attempted to devalue <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> by showing that other civilized nations were themselves reliant upon impoverished labor.  By this logic, Stowe's supporters abroad had no right to comment upon American institutions.  Wendy Hamand writes of a similarly anti-British response to incidents such as the Stafford House Address, a document from British ladies requesting an end to slavery.  Mrs. John Tyler from Virginia responded that the Duchess of Sutherland should tend to her own dependents and leave American ladies to attend to theirs.

They relied on nature to provide them with their livelihood, the planting of rice and other crops. Charles Heyward resided in Charleston for most of the year, but controlled many plantations outside of the city, including Rose Hill, Amsterdam, and Lewisburg Plantations. By 1860, he owned 471 slaves. Therefore, it was in his best interest to record a journal like the one he kept during the years 1835-1855. It was to his benefit to record patterns in the weather.","Heyward recorded that June and July of 1840 were unusually cold and rainy for the summer months, putting a strain on the crops. He noted that although this kind of weather was favorable in the city, it was detrimental to the countryside where his plantations were located. In addition, August was a very wet month, which injured many of the crops and forced an early and unfavorable harvest. The cotton crop was injured the most. In the South during this time, cotton reigned supreme among crops. For a cotton harvest to fail like this created economic alarm among South Carolinians and Southerners in general. The year 1841 did not bring a good harvest, either. In fact, Heyward noted that it brought the worst harvest the area had seen in years. Although it came in September that year, relatively on time, the rain arrived that year in conjunction with the excessive high tides, which crested the river banks and caused the harvest to be quite deplorable.","The weather was just one of many factors that caused Charleston's cotton exports to fall sixty percent between 1821 and 1842. Business was terrible in the Charleston cotton market. Reportedly, grass was growing in the streets by 1842. Charlestonians grew alarmed because each member of the city's society, from slave to wealthy planter had a stake in agriculture. Planters and their families had less money; slaves were treated worse because of the darkened moods of the planters and overseers. They tended to blame slaves for bad harvests since they were the ones working with the crops. It was up to publications like The Southern Agriculturist to help planters think through their options in an effort for agriculture to become profitable once again. Theodore Rosegarten's essay The Southern Agriculturist in an Age of Reform, highlights a society based on the riches of the harvest. Because planters were arguing about what was causing their problems, The Southern Agriculturist was created to help scientifically sort out the issues of the growing season.

Though Sam claimed himself a free man, Pope placed a front page advertisement in the local paper requesting Fary's owner to come forward, prove property, pay charges and take him away, or he will be dealt with as the law directs. The newspaper notice included a small cartoon of a running black man.  Pope's ad acknowledges Fary's claim to being a free man, and described no fewer than seven documents in Fary's possession.  One document purports that Fary bought his own freedom from James Kagler in 1840.  His other documents included passes, four of which call him Isaac. One document, signed by Kagler and dated five days before the arrest, gave Fary permission to pass within the State, or to visit his connexions in North Carolina. Fary also carried a Dream Book bearing a woman's name. ","Many details of this incident remain unknown, contributing to the mysterious nature of what seems a wholly unjust incarceration.  Sheriff Pope gives all appearances of blatantly holding a free black man in jail and attempting to pass him off as a fugitive slave.  This incident, played out even under the rules of a slaveholding society, offers little rationality for advertising a black man, with documentation of his freedom, as a slave.  Pope excludes any possibility in his notice that Fary may have spoken truthfully and that his paperwork may have been perfectly valid.  Perhaps Fary was utilizing the traditional week of Christmas vacation as an opportunity to visit relatives.  If Fary was in fact telling the truth, Pope stood to gain from re-enslaving him to a local buyer, receiving at the very least the jailing charges. Even if Pope had specific evidence that Fary was indeed a fugitive slave who had obtained false papers, the fact that he omitted such evidence in the advertisement suggests that readers would have automatically believed a white man over a freed black.","The rights of free blacks in Prince Edward County, Virginia, as argued by Mel Ely, blend incongruously with what appears the total lack of rights afforded to Fary in the North Carolina Piedmont.  Ely's description of the possibilities afforded to free blacks in the rural Old South spars with the efforts of those like Willie Pope to contain African-Americans within, or return them to, the system of slavery.

"," The kidnapping and subsequent selling of African Americans into slavery became rare in ","the years after slavery was abolished in the United States. However, while it was not ordinary ","for blacks to be kidnapped and sold after the Civil War, Johnson writes that it was a rather ","common occurrence during the days of the slave trade in the South. The instances in which free ","blacks were sold back into slavery ranged from them being arrested as runaway slaves to ","executors of their master's wills selling them after the will specified they were to be freed to ","outright kidnapping by slave traders in the South. Because the legality of selling a freed African ","American is highly questionable, the slave traders would have to come up with vague alternative ","histories for their newly acquired merchandise. As Johnson writes, these were the most ","extreme cases of the creative power of the traders' market practice. By reworking the histories ","of freed African Americans that they procured through various means, the slave traders were not ","just selling slaves but also creating them. However, the cases in which Johnson chronicles deal ","only with freed blacks that are sold in slave markets in the United States, namely New Orleans, ","and not in foreign nations.

After three years of recommendations, petitions, and court proceedings, the Senate of the state of North Carolina denied Lunsford Lane extension on his residency in the state to allow more time to purchase his wife and seven children.  Lunsford had been commended and allowed by his employer, the Governor of the State, to remain employed in the Governor's office keeping order, running errands, and making deliveries, according to a letter sent to the Legislature.  The letter acknowledged that this would be against the North Carolina law that required free slaves to leave within twenty days of being warned out. In 1840, the Secretary to Governor Dudley wrote the first request for Lane's extenuating circumstances.  The letter was answered with no objection, but the situation was considered a legal matter, which resulted in Lane being summoned to court. Due to an unprepared prosecution team, the case was postponed for three months, which allowed Lane to negotiate a petition of relief to be signed by over twenty men and sent to the Legislature for evidence of his strength as a respectable, hard-working man.  When the Court finally met and his case was argued, Lane was not allowed in the Senate chamber because he was a colored man and waited in great fear and anticipation.  The members adjourned and harshly reported Well Lunsford, they have laid you out; the nigger bill is killed.  This was a cruel reality, laced with mockery from the white members of the Senate, and Lane claimed to have felt defeat at its worst and utter hopelessness in the face of humanity.  He was not only denied, but also banished from North Carolina, departing three days later on May 18, 1841, for New York City.What is significant about this narrative is the blurred definition of freedom in all-white institutions in the South.  The freedom granted to Lunsford Lane is an example of the restrictions placed on blacks even after they reached their ultimate goal of liberty.  Freedom was never really free, as historian Robert Fogel found in research of slaves and their owners.  The act of denying citizenship and any extended privileges were both absent from the lives of freed blacks in almost every state, which often left them still suffering from oppression in a white supremacist society, no matter what physical or mental state they were in.  In Lane's case, even though he was awarded freedom, his material conditions and life working for the Governor at least allowed him to be close to his family and earn a substantial living, which were not guaranteed with his freedom."],"display_date":"November 3, 1840 - May 18, 1841","search_date":"1841-02-08","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2453,"title":"THRILLS ON CAPITAL HILL: The Election of James T.

November 5, was a chance to right the wrongs of the election of 1870, only two years prior. The 1870 election included the race for secretary of state and James T. Rapier, born a free black in Florence, Alabama just thirty-three years prior, was on the ballot. Rapier became a prominent figure early in his life, participating in the National Negro Labor Convention (NNLC) and working as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessor among other involvements. It was not until Rapier became the first African American in Alabama history to run for a state office that his popularity nearly doubled. ","Despite his historic run, Rapier did not win the election of 1870. Klu Klux Klansmen, who, based on their beliefs, had obvious qualms with Rapier's attempt, intimidated voters with threats and violence. The Klan's interference made it nearly impossible for Rapier to garner support. Thankfully Rapier was neither discouraged nor fearful of the Klan. He courageously continued about his efforts in order to better situate himself for the 1872 midterm elections to follow. Rapier sought out allies in the black community in order to gain endorsements from any recognizable resource. He established himself as a republican and mounted an impressive campaign for Congress. His travels took him to nearly every area of Alabama. But, it was not until Election Day in 1872 that the fruits of his labor were realized.","Election Day was calm and peaceful. As hoped, blacks crowded the polls early in the day, showing their support for their fellow black citizen, James T. Rapier. Previous elections in Alabama had become violently protested, but the elections of November 5, 1872, proved to be perhaps the most tranquil in Alabama election history. Unhindered by interference and intimidation, nearly 70 seventy percent of the voter's turned out at the polls. As the totals were tallied, it was evident that Rapier would win, sweeping the Black Belt and carrying over one thousand white votes. Crucial to his victory was the fact that throughout his campaign James T. Rapier focused solely on planks in his party's platform. Rapier refused to discuss his race, citing it as a feature unique to him that would not negatively affect his leadership in Congress.","The election of 1872 proved to have a positive influence on racial opinions in the state of Alabama. Electing James T. Rapier to Congress sent a message to others in the South that repressing race was not the answer and no longer the norm. There were those in the South who still vehemently opposed the election of a black man to Congress. Despite opposition, it is important to realize the intense progress of the black race. Less than ten years prior to the election of James T. Rapier, blacks were enslaved pieces of disenfranchised property that counted as 3/5 of a citizen.

Clement D. Newman experienced this effect when he made this relocation in 1845. Newman recounts the social life of his new town to his father in a letter dated January 1, 1846. Though Newman surely liked the town of Norfolk, he admitted that the manners and customs are very different from what they are in New York State. The town's Christmas celebration greatly impressed Newman, as he enjoyed the fire crackers, presents, eggnog, turkey, whiskey, and Church services. In fact, Newman claimed that the town's Roman Catholic preacher was the most gifted orator that he had ever heard. He also noticed the importance of the naval shipping industry in Norfolk, which was one of the largest exporters on the East Coast. While talking to a sailor down at the port, Newman learned that orders had been given to outfit all of the vessels at the station in preparation for war. A Negro sale also took place shortly after Newman's arrival to Norfolk, an event which was an interesting sight to Northern eyes. At the sale, a number of slaves were sold, but the most intriguing sale to Newman was that of an old woman for a mere 39 dollars. Though the events and customs of his new home were a bit odd, Newman reiterated his content with Norfolk, and told his father that he was getting along very well in Virginia.","Newman's letter reveals a Northern perspective on Tidewater Virginia society. The festivities and Christmas celebrations that he attends shows the tight-knit community of Norfolk, and the welcoming nature of the town. At no point does Newman feel threatened or unwelcome due to his Northern status; he had no negative words for the kindness of the townspeople. More importantly, Newman's letter reveals two of Norfolk's main economic strengths - the slave trade and naval yards. Since its founding, Norfolk had been a coveted naval outpost for the British and Americans. Situated with the Elizabeth and James Rivers to the south and west, the Chesapeake Bay to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Norfolk had sensational access to shipping and transportation lines. Norfolk's ports were essential to the Union's economy, and also played significant roles in the sea exploration. During the mid-nineteenth century, around the time Newman lived in Norfolk, Wilkes' expedition to Antarctica and Perry's voyage to Japan originated from Norfolk's Gosport Shipyard. Newman also alluded to preparation for the upcoming Mexican-American War, a war in which ships from Norfolk would be employed.","The slave sale that Newman saw represents another facet of Norfolk's economy. Norfolk was one of the major slave centers on the eastern seaboard. From there, slaves were sent down to the slave markets of the Deep South. The slaves from Norfolk were marched overland by chains, shipped around the coast by boat, or taken down the Mississippi River on steamboats. Norfolk's status as a slave sale headquarters was essential to its prosperity and development throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.","Newman's letter highlights the cultural shock that a Northerner would experience after moving to the South, and touches on small events that reveal Norfolk's economic importance to the nation."],"display_date":"January 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-01","locations":[{"id":14407,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2472,"title":"Portsmouth&#39;s Religious Revival\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-04-09","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the early 1840s, sectional conflict threatened to divide two of the South's most influential churches. Members of the Methodist and Baptist Churches, divided over their church's stance on the issue of slavery, quarreled over whether they should support the South's crucial institution. Agreements could not be reached, and, in 1844 and 1845, the Methodist and Baptist Churches split along sectional borders. Despite the divisions, these churches remained strong in the South. In 1850, 37.4 percent of Southerners were members of the Methodist domination. 34.6 percent attended Southern Baptist churches. Church attendance in the North, which had never been extremely high, remained below the South's. However, a religious revival occurred throughout the nation that would have effects on both regions.","During the year 1858, in the town of Portsmouth, Virginia, George Neville excitedly wrote to his cousin Nellie Newman, a resident of the nearby Isle of Wight County, regarding the current state of his town's religious community. A member of the Dinwiddie Street Methodist Episcopal Church, George Neville believed that appearances indicate that we are on the verge of a very powerful revival of religion in our city. Prayer meetings were being held four or five times daily at the Dinwiddie Church, and close to ten townspeople were converted just the night before. Furthermore, this newfound religious fervor was not limited to just Neville's congregation. Down the street at the Wesley Chapel, there were six converts and 15 penitents at last night's services, which lasted until 11 o'clock at night. Neville felt that the spirit of the Lord descended in great power upon the congregations, and that the people of Portsmouth were on their way to salvation.","This revival had wide effects around the nation as religion became more public, commercialized, and dynamic. The epicenter of the revival was New York City, as it was the nation's media hub at the time. Furthermore, church attendance was much lower in the North, causing the renewed religious interest to be more dramatic than in the South. While the revival was more active in the North, it still affected the South. Southerners believed the revival was more diversifying than unifying. The revival led people to scrutinize the principles of each denomination. As people began asking the same religious questions over slavery that had divided the Methodist and Baptist churches, the moral differences between the North and South were reinforced. With the nation aflame over slavery expansion in the West, this religious revival further agitated the nation's sectional conflict. Though George Neville's letter appears to be positive, the religious revival continued to rouse the emotions and to highlight the differences between the North and South, effects that increased sectional tension within the Union."],"display_date":"April 9, 1858 - December 31, 1860","search_date":"1859-08-20","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2483,"title":"The Effects of Expansion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-02","end_date":"1855-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the mid-nineteenth century, the Union feuded over the issue of slavery expansion in the western territories. On January 2, 1849, the newspaper of Suffolk, Virginia, <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em>, printed an article entitled The Great Question. This article examined this turmoil, and pleaded the Union to mend its internal strife. The author explained that Northern fanatics in Congress were imposing abolition notions on the nation, efforts that threatened to bring the nation to the verge of disunion. Two new propositions were being discussed in Washington. The first was a proposal to abolish slavery in the nation's capital, and the second was a motion to bar slavery in California and New Mexico. The article contended that these two proposals had created a kindred feeling among all Southerners, regardless of their political orientation. The Northerners' proposals questioned the equality of a Southern man's property rights; it was hypocritical to allow a man from Ohio to move to Virginia with all his possessions, but to forbid a Virginian from bringing his property (slaves) into Ohio. The author attributed the source of these problems to the recent land acquisitions in the west, most notably the annexations of California, Texas, and New Mexico. The Great Question continued to examine this dilemma by describing the political stances of the Whig and Democratic parties. Though it was too late to quarrel over what has been done, the article claimed that the Whig party initially opposed the acquisition, and that the Democratic party supported the expansion. Therefore, the Intelligencer attributed the current turmoil to the Democrats. The article ends with a glimmer of hope, as the author believed that the councils of Congress would succeed, and reunite the North and South once again.","The article clearly summarizes the nation's state during the time of expansionism, and exposes the beginnings of clear sectional division. Though the nation had yet to split politically, the significance of these proposals would soon divide the Whigs and Democrats, creating sectional rifts that would weaken each party. The article describes proposals that would eventually help form the Compromise of 1850, a plan that would leave both Northerners and Southerners angry and unsettled. This turmoil would continue to heighten tensions between the regions. On a regional scope, the article's description of a newfound Southern unity is extremely important, as Southerners began to unite and to view the North as a common enemy. The mention of equal rights highlights one of the main issues bothering the Southerners, as many were angered that the Northerner's proposals threatened to take away their property. The seeds of disunion were beginning to sprout during this time period, and the nation was slowly moving towards bloody conflict."],"display_date":"January 2, 1849 - December 31, 1855","search_date":"1852-07-02","locations":[{"id":14073,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2501,"title":"A Former Slave&#39;s Account on Abolition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-01","end_date":"1857-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Frederick Douglass perceived Maryland to be a state that possessed slavery in its mildest form.

Though he was taking a risk as a reader he also writes to inform the editors that the anti-slavery cause is rapidly gaining ground in this section of the country.  The African American papers acted as a source to unite free blacks across the country and make their motives known to the rest of the country.  The papers offered a means for the abolitionist groups and movement to spread throughout the country.

In the 1830s, the abolitionists cause was growing through the establishment of African American newspapers.  These were published in the North but traveled south to enslaved people, or free blacks living in the South.  One such paper was The Colored American, established in 1839 in New York by three men; Samuel Cornish, Philip Bell, and Charles Bennett Ray.

Though Little Caroline [was] accused of pilfering money from members of the Blackford family, the change was never proven, and Mr. Blackford still looked after the health of his slaves.  Mr Blackford showered his slaves with special favors. John Blackford owned Ferry Hill Plantation in Maryland from 1816-1840.  In 1838, he owned twenty-five slaves and employed, forty-one other workers.  As a slave owner he seldom complained about their work; there is only one recorded criticism of his slave workers. While he did punish his bondsmen, it was a rare occasion and came only after he felt it was deserved.  Careless or deliberate destruction of property he would not tolerate.  This carelessness resulted in a few lashes, but it did not occur often.  Blackford hardly ever supervised his slaves, and was considered a considerate master.

To Saul and many other slaves in the South, familial ties were strong.  The deeper reasons for Saul's flight are unknown, but the separation he faced from his family was a common reason why many slaves throughout the South ran away. Even if slaves had been separated, theirs was still a tight community.  In Walter Johnson's book, <em>Soul by Soul</em>, Thomas Jones was taught from a young age about the strong ties of his family because his parents cried when they talked about the fear they had of their children being torn from them and sold into the slave trade.  This dread that families had of separation forged tight bonds that lasted even after they were separated, causing many to run away in order to return to their families.  Slave owners throughout the South recognized the deep familial connections and some would not punish them by the use of a whip, but would threaten to sell them from their family if they did not cooperate.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2519,"title":"Missionary Efforts Lead to Interracial Worship\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-01-01","end_date":"1828-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Mr. Charles C. Pickney, impressed by a Methodist overseer of slaves in Georgia, asked Reverend William Capers to acquire a Methodist exhorter to oversee his negroes in 1828.  Instead, Mr. Capers proposed that Pickney apply to the Bishop and Missionary Board for a minister to be sent as a missionary and devote his time exclusively to the religious instruction and welfare of his slaves.  Mr. Pickney agreed and soon his peers, Colonel Lewis Morris and Mr. Charles Baring, followed suit.  This system of religious instruction extended all over the state, and as a result, white Americans and African Americans often worshiped together.  Missions to the slaves developed formally in Southern religious denominations in the late 1820s and early 1830s.  Slave masters employed white missionaries to reach out to enslaved blacks throughout the South and ensured blacks minimal rights to religious worship, including the ability to worship jointly with their masters.  Even though these missionary efforts sometimes led to communal worship, the religious interests of white Americans and African Americans varied greatly.  Charles Joyner observed that slaves didn't adapt to the selective Christianity evangelized to them by their masters as much as they adapted Christianity to themselves.  In other words, whites and blacks heard different messages from Christianity.  For one, African Americans embraced the elements of Christianity that were most African such as its communal and expressive, and components.  Additionally, whereas whites believed that God divinely ordained blacks to be inferior, slaves held onto the conviction enslavement was a in total conflict with the universal love and equality that Christianity preached.Mr. Pickney's, Colonel Morris's, and Mr. Baring's eagerness to acquire a Methodist missionary for the education of their slaves supports Joyner's observation.  Educating their slaves served as a tool of domination.  The missionaries taught the slaves an interpretation of Christianity that justified the practice of slavery while giving the slaves limited rights to worship and indirectly allowing them to come up with their own interpretations of Christianity.  Slavery and Christianity were compatible in that their coexistence was of mutual benefit to both slave and master.

Directly under and advertisement of ten pigs for sale, there is the section of lost property, for which rewards are offered. There are six articles that report lost animals or slaves. 50 is offered for a stolen black horse, as well as 50 for a dark bay mare. Intermixed with these ads for horses, are rewards for runaway slaves, ranging from 50 to 300 per slave. Descriptions of color, markings, age, and last known location are given for slave and animal alike. The only difference in description between the two categories of lost property is that the horses are reported stolen, while the slaves are reported as runaway; logically showing that the horses could not have let themselves out of their gates. ","This underscores the status of people, slaves at the time, were property. The moral ambiguity and hypocritical self-justification did not matter as much as the value that slaveowners attributed to this human commodity. Slave traders would have associates search the country for good bargains on slaves.

The slave demand had a clear connection to the cycles of the agricultural economy, the harvesting of various crops in different regions.","Walter Johnson outlines the methodical process in which slaves were separated from every part of their person identity, except their unbreakable souls. Slaves were stripped down of their personal character and taught new skills in order to provide a commodity to the customer; whatever type of slave was needed was offered, whether a field hand, a butler or a mistress. Out of this systematic trade of humans, the beginning of self-emancipation was born, Slaves sometimes stood up in defiance of being sold, even if it meant suicide, and all slaves became unified in slave communities, while they waited in pens to be sold."],"display_date":"May 12, 1863 - May 13, 1863","search_date":"1863-05-12","locations":[{"id":13639,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2538,"title":"Freedom of the Black Press?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-20","end_date":"1889-08-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was just another days' work for two employees of the Alabama Great Southern train company.  On the evening of August 27, 1889, the trainmen pulled into the Birmingham station and prepared to disembark.  Upon exiting the train, the workers spotted two black men swinging from trees in the near distance.  According to sources at <em>The Washington Post,</em> the lynched men were the incendiary editors of the black newspaper, the Independent.  The editors were allegedly run out of Selma, Alabama the preceding week and supposed to have been lynched in Birmingham.  <em>The Post </em>noted, It is impossible to get particulars.  ","<em>The Post's</em> report incidentally concluded the dramatic Selma controversy first exposed in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> on August 20, 1889.  The article, Alabama's War of Races, shed light on the racial tensions that plagued Selma.  On August 19, Reverend Edward Bryant, associate editor to the Independent wrote a highly controversial editorial attacking the whites of Selma and the larger southern community.   In his charged conclusion Bryant projected, You have had your revolutionary and civil wars and we here predict that at no distant day we will have our race war, and we hope, as God intends, that we will be strong enough to wipe you out of existence and hardly leave enough of you to tell the story.  According to the Tribune, Selma mayor, E. Starr publicly condemned the revolutionary nature of Byrant's editorial.  Both sides built up arms in the likely event of a violent outbreak.  Mayor Starr held the pledge of Confederate veterans to fight on behalf of the uniformly armed white population of Selma.  Bloodshed and conflict appeared almost unavoidable.   ","Racial tensions and violence plague the history of Alabama.  According to historian Virginia Hamilton, the use of violence was originally disconnected from racial issues, oftentimes settling disputes between whites settlers.  However, the tradition of violence in Alabama eventually shifted towards African Americans in the years following the Civil War.  Hamilton writes, Violence, the hasty recourse for settling scores between white men in frontier Alabama, was focused upon blacks after emancipation and war had proclaimed them to be people instead of property.  Initially the fear of a black uprising involving armed and newly freed slaves drove groups such as the Ku Klux Klan to persecute and execute countless African Americans in Alabama.  Towards the end of the century, however, statewide politics influenced many lynchings across the state.  One such example was the infamous 1882 lynching of black Republican leader, Jack Turner.  When Turner's Choctow County voted Republican in the 1882 gubernatorial election, the Democrats panicked.  With an upcoming congressional election the Democrats could not risk losing political power to the Republicans; Turner was shortly after found hanging from an oak tree.  ","    <em>The Post's</em> report of the lynching fits into the larger story of southern lynching in the post-slavery era.  A vague allegation of criminality motivated lynchings throughout the South.  There was an average of 150.4 lynchings per year during the last 19 years of the nineteenth century (1882-1900).  These lynched victims were usually accused of raping white women or other trivial crimes.  The murder of the two Independent editors does not fit into the general theme of crime retaliation seeing as the only crime committed was in their exercise of freedom of speech.  However, the story of Rev. Bryant and his associate editor at the Independent portrays the lingering fear of a black revolution.  The perpetual threat of black retaliation for slavery remained imminent in the minds of southern whites and the lynching of Bryant exemplified this fear.

Rives and V.W Southall to represent Albemarle County at the state convention. Rives and Southall, if they accepted nomination and won election, would be immersed in one of the most important events in the history of Virginia, to decide whether or not to take the state out of the Union. Though the more than 550 men nominating Rives and Southall were in favor of secession if the Federal government failed to respect Virginia's rights, they permitted Rives and Southall to exercise their own judgment at the convention. The men of Albemarle County chose Rives and Southall because of their prominent place in the community. T.J Wertenbaker, E.R Watson, J.N.O.H Bibb, and F.K Nelson were the leaders of the group who nominated Rives and Southall because their names were the only ones specifically mentioned at the end of the note to Rives and Southall.","In January 1861, Governor Letcher called a special session of the Virginia legislature, which approved a plan for a state convention. One delegate to the convention was Robert Y. Conrad an emphatic Unionist who believed Abraham Lincoln was the cause of the sectional conflict. At the convention Conrad became Chairman of a Committee on Federal Relations which debated the merits of secession. While many men in the upper south loved the Union, they supported the right of the states to secede if they chose to do so. Conrad believed the right of the states' to secede came from the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Bill of Rights. Conrad even supported a Constitutional amendment to protect slavery. His Unionist majority defeated an ordinance of secession on April 4 88 to 45. However just two weeks later the secessionists won out, carrying the Convention eighty-eight to fifty-five, a near complete reversal of Unionist fortunes. Two events sealed the fate of the Unionist cause at the Convention, the firing on Ft. Sumter, and Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops. ","Men like Conrad had expressed the will of the majority of Virginians at the start of the Convention, to remain in the Union if Congress granted them concessions, but events outside of their control made peace with Abraham Lincoln seem impossible and secession the only solution. The men of Albemarle County who nominated Rives and Southall expressed the same will in their letter that they believed in the right of secession, but wanted to stay in the Union if possible. The process by which Virginia seceded expressed the early reluctance common across Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas to leave the Union.

She found Union officers who protected her, but the threat of violence from Union soldiers was real. Louisa Minor experienced fear that day felt all over the South as Union and Confederate troops passed through widespread communities. Like others, Louisa Minor remained defiant.","The destructive force the war had for civilians surfaced as early as in Fredericksburg, Virginia between December 11 and 15 1862. Fredericksburg had been occupied by Confederate sharpshooters slowing the Union advance, so the Union troops probably felt justified in their action. Looting in the town occurred to a severe degree as the entire contents of houses was thrown into the street. The greatest loss felt by southern women like Louisa Minor was the loss of loved ones on the battlefield. Among Virginians alone, 20-30,000 men died in the war, while by 1862 alone there were 42,000 claims for back-pay by families of deceased soldiers. The suffering and fear felt by Louisa Minor and her family in Albemarle County was just a small part of the broader suffering the war brought to American civilians.","Louisa Minor's personal humiliation at the hands of Union troops repeated itself all across the Confederacy, as the movements of Union and Confederate armies initiated destruction of civilian property from Virginia to Louisiana. In Virginia, Gen. Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 devastated that area's ability to provide food for the Confederacy. Sheridan waged war on the ability of the Confederate population to resist, a method emulated all over the Confederacy by Union forces. Significant resistance by Confederate guerillas forced Sheridan to be even more extreme. Between late September and late October 1864 Sheridan systematically destroyed the Shenandoah Valley's ability to feed Confederate troops. Far from Virginia Benjamin Butler brought the war to the doorstep of Confederate civilians early in the Civil War by confiscating private property in New Orleans after the Union took that city in 1862. Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's offensive into northern Alabama in 1864 was actually more severe than Sherman's in Georgia though it achieved less renown. Confederate units and deserters from both sides also inflicted severe hardship on the Confederate civilian population.

She stated that though ice was available outside, no one brought it inside, because there were no servants left to do the work. She wrote as if that kind of labor was totally foreign to her. Louisa Minor respected the right of her former slaves to leave the plantation, but she had trouble seeing her ex-house slaves go. When she described her children's nanny, Nancy, as well as other former house slaves named Mammy, and Aunt Peggy, she revealed the reason for her sadness, constant proximity. White slave-owners gained closer relationships with their slaves when those slaves were working alongside them. When her freed slaves left her land, Louisa Minor and her children found the absence of those they spent time with everyday to be the hardest to bear.

These relationships were sometimes worse for slaves because a cruel master could deride the slave all the time if they were always around. Thus Louisa Minor's pain at seeing her ex-house-slaves leave was an expression of the relationships by which whites took advantage of slaves while acting as if they were doing it out of good-natured paternalism.

Those who were there to witness his hanging claimed that his demeanor was indifferent towards his fate, and that he even dared to smile at times. Between the daytime hours of twelve and two, Dave was publicly hung by the town sheriff. The body dangled for thirty minutes before it was cut down and buried.

","However valid the crime's impetus, the murder of a white man at the hands of a slave or person of color was considered a serious offense punishable by death. Historian Joshua Rothman argues that although most African Americans who murdered their masters were sentenced to hang, many were not forced to endure this harsh sentence due to the intervention of other whites in the town who could vouch for the particular slave's character. In the instance of Dave, however, this intervention did not occur. From the tone of the article announcing the hanging, Dave showed no remorse for what he had done.

In 1830, there were 12,612 slaves and only 621 freed African Americans. Therefore, in those 10 years, the number of slaves increased by 1,445 and the number of freed Blacks increased by only 114.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

It detailed the departure by rail of elements of Richmond's volunteer militia regiment, men who were being sent to suppress the insurrection that was taking place. The readers were also stunned to read that the governor of Virginia had ordered the men to Harpers Ferry himself; they were not called up by the federal government, which had already dispatched its own troops, US Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee.  Furthermore, Governor Henry Wise accompanied the vanguard units on a commandeered mail train to the scene of the action, with the remaining companies of the militia to be sent the next morning when more trains would be available. The citizens of Richmond could only guess how tumultuous the situation was if their own governor was personally leading the military effort. The bulk of the passage detailed the sad sight of the departing troops.  It described legions of young men and boys going off to fight in the war, not knowing if they would return in good health, or at all.","This editorial is interesting because on the one hand, it demonstrates the capabilities of the state run militia.  Governor Wise was able to call up and deploy the men in order to deal with a situation in his state without any input from the federal government. However, the true importance of this editorial lies in the southern perception of the events surrounding the Harpers Ferry raid.  The wording and tone of this passage made it very clear that people saw this event as a grave threat to state stability and peace.  One also gets the sense that there was a widespread belief that there was a major battle occurring in Harpers Ferry. There is no doubt that much of this misconception was due to the slow travel of news; the common citizens in Richmond would have no way of knowing that Brown only commanded 18 men, half of whom were dead by this time. However, even if they had known this, the principal behind this raid was what disturbed so many southerners. They saw it as a physical threat on their security by the abolitionist movement as a whole."],"display_date":"October 18, 1859","search_date":"1859-10-18","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2604,"title":" Caution to Purchasers of Negros \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-05-20","end_date":"1826-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an 1826 article, an Alabama newspaper warned readers and slave buyers of an untrustworthy slave trader who dealt in kidnapped free blacks.  Victims were found in Mississippi, greatly abused or dead.  The slave trader had even captured a young free black boy from his parents. The free men informed a gentleman, at whose house he stopped, that they were free born, and begged his interference to procure their unlawful bondage. The gentlemen eventually found one of the black men dead in the wagon. Several humane gentlemen became advocates of the free men, as they hosted the African Americans until they were returned to their homes in Philadelphia. "," Significant in its judgment of the event, the Alabama newspaper condemned the practice of stealing freemen and selling them into slavery. While the article states regret for the loss uncured on the purchaser, the article went on to harshly condemn the practice: If we would not have our brethren of the north harbor and protect our fugitive slaves who may escape hither, let us be prompt in restoring their free citizens who may be torn from them by the ruthless hand of lawless violence... ","   Paradoxical in the condemnation of lawless violence and the desired retrieval of their fugitive slaves, this article is evidence of southern complexities.  As Walter Johnson discusses in his book, <em>Soul by Soul,</em> while none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known... often state law holds them in bondage anyway.  The recommended route to restored freedom, the courts, prosecuted illicit slave trading yet such a suit required legal and financial support, luxuries most slaves lacked.   The <em>American Mirror</em> was harsh in its criticism of this vagabond slave trader, purporting such kidnappings as a universal wrong.  The article's assertion, that freedom so dear to every American and to which he, although of a different complexion, is no less entitled to than ourselves, is problematic.  Alabama writers used the argument of equality for free blacks without recognizing the hypocrisy of such statements.","     Slaveholders perceived themselves, as discussed by Johnson, as benevolent law-abiding citizens, in contrast to wicked law-breaking slave traders.  Using proslavery rhetoric to justify human bondage, slaveholders told themselves they were rescuing slaves from the slave market or ill-treatment.

Templeman and Goodwin of Richmond, Virginia, January 2 to the 31 in 1857 was a time of rather lucrative business.They sold a great deal of merchandise and had made a significant amount of profit.  In fact, their sales business had seen mostly boon time since they first established in Richmond in 1849.   However, for their merchandise, times were not so good.  They found their families torn apart and their bodies broken; Templeman and Goodwin were slave traders, and their merchandise was human beings.  During the aforementioned period, 33 slaves were sold for a total profit of 12,390.  This was a very large amount of money at this time.  The slaves were sold individually at prices ranging from 700 to 1000 on average.  It is interesting to note that when slaves were sold, only the name of the buyer was listed, that of the slave was omitted.  It was as if the traders wanted to forget that a particular slave ever existed.  Slaves' names were listed when they were first acquired; however, only a temporary first name was entered and an identification number assigned along with it, in what appears to be a tactic for dehumanization.  ","    As a centrally located major southern city, Richmond was a bustling slave trade market.  Traders would often come from the Tidewater area by way of the James River with slaves from all around the South.  The James also served as a highway in the opposite direction as well, with Richmond born slaves being moved to ports such as Norfolk to be sent to the Deep South.  Slave traders themselves were a varied group.  Some were rather unscrupulous men who sought to achieve great wealth quickly and had reputations for overabsuing their charges.  However, other slave traders were working in what they considered a family business.  They often took great pride in their work and on their reputations of delivering high quality slaves at reasonable prices.  In a fashionable metropolis such as Richmond, there can be no doubt that more then a few of the elite citizenry were heavily involved in the slave trade.  In fact, as this ledger indicates, both Templeman and Goodwin would have been in the upper strata of wealth in Richmond due to their very high income.

At length he took resolution to learn the alphabet at all events, and encountering to be among school children, he learned the letters by heart. Soon afterwards, he acquired old parts of spelling books, which he mastered with but little difficulty. His brother, excited by this, tried to learn as well, as well as some friends. George was smarter than his brother, and he became a far better reader than he; every Sunday during the year, he would go off by himself and would stammer over the dim syllables in his spelling book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of another. He would scarcely spare the time to return to ordinary meals, being so engaged with the book.

According to her, anti-literacy laws were rarely enforced, and most white Southern slaves were indifferent to the issue of slave literacy. In fact, by permitting slaves to read the Bible and thus providing them a path to salvation, many slave owners may have assuaged their consciences about the harsh ways in which they treated their human properties.

In his will he divided his estate between his children. Dividing one's property up in a will was very common in the antebellum south. Most plantation owners, if not all, wrote up some sort of will to divide their estate up so their children and widow could have some type of inheritance. Slaves and property, such as land, were two types of things a child or widow would acquire from a will left by either their husband or father. On some occasions, a widow or child would not be able to gain their inheritance because it would have to be used to pay off debts left by their husband or father. Debts were common in the south, and many people used slaves as collateral because every slave had a price. Mr. Pellicer was a man who had many debts that needed to be paid off after he died. These debts were essentially left for his children to pay off with their inheritance; however, Francis Pellicer Jr's, who was suppose to be the current administrator of the slaves and debt issues, siblings accused him of selling slaves from the estate and keeping the proceeds. ","The other five children, suspicious of their brother, decided to file a petition to the Honorable James P. Cotter, Elias B. Gould, and Antonio Alvarez, who were all judges of the County Court for St. John's County. The petition asked the court to order an inventory of Pellicer's estate, which consisted of twenty four slaves, and to replace the current administrator, Pellicer Jr., because they suspected that he sold the slaves and kept the proceeds. In addition, the other Pellicer children told the court that there were outstanding debts against the estate, but there has not been a full account of the inventory on the estate and debt. The suit was an intra-family suit that dealt with the necessity to account for all the slaves in the estate in order to pay for the debts. To pay off the debt, the Pellicers would have to sell the estates' slaves; however, if it were true that Pellicer Jr. was keeping the money from the sold slaves then the debts would not have been paid off in full. There were many insistences in the antebellum south where debts were paid off through the sale of slaves that were supposed to be inherited by a widow or child(ren). Since slaves' prices were high, ranging from the hundreds to thousands, some widows and children were able to pay off their debt.

The biggest mystery of all was the disappearance of Lina Hanna's mother and sister. Many suspect that Penn, in order to silence the witnesses, murdered both women. Some townsfolk believed that he discarded of the bodies in another state. Regardless, Penn was successful in covering up his actions and destroyed any way of himself being accused of such a violent crime. Penn terrified Hanna's mother and sister, and they did not want to accuse him in fear of the possible consequences. ","White masters raping their young black workers was a frequent occurrence, before, during and after the Civil War. This instance involving Hanna and Penn was just one of many situations in which sex crossed the color line. Some were voluntary actions of both parties, while some, such as the story of Lina Hanna, were rapes. ","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women. Black men and women began to try to stop the abuse; whenever a black woman would enter a store where a white man would be, there would be a group of black men waiting outside for her. "," Although its prevalence declined, interracial sex did not stop; it moved from the plantations to the towns, where there were more opportunities for a sexual act to go unnoticed. The populations in towns were constantly changing, and the chance of an intimate moment between two people of different races, who were unacquainted, was far more common without the possibility of affecting the lives of either person. "," The rape of Lina Hanna is different from the trend at the time, because it occurred on a plantation. This specific instance became less common after slavery ended and time went on.

Often, slaves were used as collateral to buy land. This process of using slaves as collateral dates back to the beginning of the slave trade. The main reason why slaves were used as collateral is that southerners considered slaves to be property and have a price. Prices for slaves ranged any where from a hundred dollars to over a thousand dollars. The healthier and stronger the slave was the more value a slave acquired. When loans, debts, and mortgages were not paid off the seller or loaner would claim their right to the slave that was used for collateral. Business finished and the debt no longer existed once the seller or loaner acquired the slave. Unfortunately, loans and debts did not always go smooth when it was time for collection. There have been cases where the buyer or person who asked for the loan did not have the money to pay up, did not want to pay up at that time, or decided he did not want to give up his slave. Usually, these deals were written on paper so that there was proof of the business deal. ","In St. Johns County, Florida, one deal ended up as a petition sent to the court by the loaner. Manuel Aquair, a white male, petitioned to the Honorable Joseph L. Smith of the Superior Court for the Eastern district of Florida. He asked the court to help him foreclose on a loan for four hundred and twenty five dollars that he made to Nicholas Morgan. In addition, he asked the court to order that Morgan surrender the slave, July, who Morgan had offered as collateral for the loan. Since Morgan did not repay the debt, Aquair was entitled to claim the slave, July. Aquair made sure in his petition that he told the court that Morgan would not settle the debt or surrender the slave. Petitions like Aquair's petition were common in county courts. Most rulings ended up in favor of the petitioner because people such as Morgan in this case would not hold up to their end of the deal. Not only were the deals put on paper but they were given a time frame. Since Morgan did not repay the loan by the deadline set by Aquair and him, he was obligated to turn the slave over or pay the debt immediately. Cases that involved loans and collateral were usually some of the easiest cases to rule. Judge Smith granted to hear Aquair's case.

During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E.

They ran away for many reasons. They suffered from the brutal treatment of their master. They sought to be reunited with relatives or friends that lived in the North. They could run away just to experience the taste of freedom that had been stripped away from them. Most slave holders posted news about their runaways in the local newspapers. Most of the rewards for these fugitive slaves ranged from 100-1,000 dollars. The value of the slave depended on how crucial the slave was to the slaveholder. In Fairfax County one such notice reported that a slave named William Lee, described as a bright mulatto who had escaped from the plantation of Virginia slaveholder WM. H. Guenell.

Not only did James Tinsley give Mary Jane but also all of her increase forever. It was not unusual for southern children to inherit and grow up with a slave.  In the South, many whites felt familial allegiance from their slaves because the slaves had been a part of the family through many generations.

Because of a 1662 Virginia statute, the condition of the mother constituted the slave status of the child.  The purpose of this law was to maintain slave status for children of interracial relationships between slaves and whites.  This was the primary reason for this law because most legal matters such as inheritance are passed through the father's offspring. This legislature greatly benefited a state such as Virginia, who capitalized on slave reproduction.  Virginia's soil began to loose nutrients during the nineteenth century; therefore it was more rewarding for Virginian slave holders to sell slaves to Deep South states for labor in more agriculturally lucrative areas.

In a letter from Waller Taylor in Washington to Mr. Austin, Mr. Taylor explained the happenings in Washington and all of the current political events that were taking place, such as admitting new states and territories. In his March 25 letter, the Florida question was put to rest with a Treaty with Spain. Waller Taylor expressed his gratefulness that the Missouri question was settled, despite his disagreement -- These are not as bad as they appear upon first blush...This is at least some consolation, but it does not justify compromising the principles of the Constitution. "," Taylor's letter speaks of the addition of new states to the United States that sparked heated political discussion. Americans on both sides of the conflict were concerned about upsetting the balance of slave states and non-slave sates in Congress. If the numbers favored either side, their way of life would come to dominate the country. The addition of both Florida and Missouri sparked extremely intense debating between the North and the South. ","As a slave holding state, Virginia wanted to expand slavery into the new states so that the South would have the upper hand in Congress and eventually make slavery the common way of life for the entire country. Certain territories were admitted with slavery and others were not. When Florida entered the United States in 1809, it was a territory that allowed slavery. On the other hand, Missouri entered the country in 1820 - its position on slavery was highly debated in Congress. The Missouri Compromise called for Missouri and Maine both to enter the United States at the same time. Missouri would be a slave state and Maine would enter as a free state. The Fugitive Slave Law was strengthened and the slave trade in in Washington DC was abolished. From this point forward, slavery in territories would be determined by 36'30 latitude line that was Missouri's southern border. "," Although the Missouri question was settled, Virginians and the rest of the South saw very little compromise. Both sides felt like they got the bad side of the arrangement. The South wanted to extend slavery into as many territories as possible and this put a damper on this hope for expansion.

Many people in the antebellum south used promissory notes when dealing with large amounts of money. John Day and Horatio S. Dexter entered into a promissory note together on October 5, 1824. The amount of the note was for six thousand four hundred and seventy nine dollars. Dexter mortgaged one thousand acres of land, forty-nine slaves and other property to John Day, which was the equivalent of six thousand four hundred and seventy nine dollars. Day was supposed to receive payment by January 5, 1827. After Day waited for almost three years, he decided to file a petition to Judge Joseph L. Smith to receive his payment since Dexter did not pay him any of the money by January. Day requested that the mortgaged premises be court ordered and adjudged to be sold so that the proceeds from the sales would go to him. Day wanted to make sure he got six thousand four hundred and seventy nine dollars as promised in the promissory note he composed with Dexter.","Dexter's actions put him into a debt. Mortgaging slaves and property for such high debts was not a smart decision on Dexter's part. It is not known if the petition was granted by Judge Smith, but it is very possible that Judge Smith did grant it because the amount in the note to Dexter was a very large sum of money. In addition, Day had a list of all the slaves' names that Dexter mortgaged for the six thousand four hundred and seventy nine dollars. Some of the slaves were Caty, Simon, Joseph, Morris, James, and Israel.  It is known that most mortgages and debts were high, but only on rare occasions was a mortgage as high as the one Dexter acquired in one promissory note. It was possible for southern families to acquire debt, as high as six thousand four hundred and seventy nine dollars, but that debt would consist of numerous purchases and loans over the course of time or through inheritance of on going debt from a deceased family member. Acquiring debt over long periods with out paying for them would leave a bad impression of that person in the city or town. When word got around that someone was petitioning to the court because he had not received payment from the person who needed the loan, that person's reputation in the community would sometimes be tarnished. The person in need of the loan would find himself in a worse predicament than he began. The predicament was worse because once that person had exhausted his resources, others in the county might be less inclined to help that person anymore because he would not be trusted to pay for the loan. ","High mortgages and debts taught valuable lessons on money management to both the person who needed the loan and the loaner. The person who needed the loan realized that their plan was not sufficient and only made matters worse. The loaner learned his lesson not to trust many people when it comes to loaning money, especially large amounts. These lessons could be applied to anyone in the antebellum south who entered into bad mortgage deals that dealt with slaves and property as collateral. Yet, it seems that no matter how many debts were made and how many petitions had to be filed in order to receive payment, mortgaging slaves and property was popular in the beginning of the nineteenth century and continued to be popular until slavery was abolished."],"display_date":"May 29, 1827","search_date":"1827-05-29","locations":[{"id":1455,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST JOHNS, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2713,"title":"Desolation Leads to a Soldier&#39;s Desertion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-12-04","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" On December 5, 1864, John L.

Buchwalter lived in Cincinnati, Ohio. He convicted a prisoner and sent him to Kentucky. Once he arrived in Kentucky, not long after he got off the train, the prisoner was lynched. This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

The inscription chosen by Governor Chapman of Alabama read as follows: Alabama. A union of equality, as adjusted by the Constitution. This dedication was authorized by the Alabama General Assembly on December 4, 1849. ","The editor of the <em>Huntsville Democrat</em>, a newspaper based in Madison County, Alabama, responded to the Governor's inscription on the stone in his May 16 editorial. In his column, the editor expressed many of the same sentiments toward the Union that the stone's inscription had implied. He expressed his belief in a Union of equality, in which sovereign states were bound together by mutual interests and the obligations set out by the Constitution. Under these precepts, he felt that each state should not have to sacrifice its own identity and beliefs at the expense of the national majority. To illustrate his point, the editor used an analogy comparing the states in the Union to the stones which made up the Washington Monument. He argued that each state, like the individual stones of the monument, could act as its own separate entity maintaining its own identity and still be incorporated as a part of the larger whole. ","The motto on the Alabama stone of the Washington Monument and the editorial in the <em>Huntsville Democrat</em> alluded to growing sectionalism in the United States. This sectionalism was agitated by the possibility of Congress limiting the practice of slavery in the new territories acquired in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War. According to the authors of <em>Alabama: The History of a Deep South State</em>, the people of Alabama interpreted the United States policy against slavery as an attack on their individual rights as a sovereign state. These sentiments serve to reflect the strict constructionist ideology of many Southerners who believed that since the Constitution did not directly grant the Federal Government control over the issue of slavery, all decisions concerning the institution should be delegated to the States. The editor of the Huntsville Democrat clearly echoed this perspective in his May 16 article.

Despite notices of Joe's capture, Sheriff French Strother was unable to prove the certainty behind his claim, because no one from Miss. Rust's estate came forward to verify his freedom or to prove he was their property. Without proof that Joe was either free or enslaved Sheriff Strother concluded that he was a runaway. A public auction for Joe's re-sale into slavery was then scheduled for January 2nd, 1841 at the Rappahannock County Courthouse.  Sheriff Strother advertised in the local paper that Joe would be sold to the highest bidder, to be paid for in cash.  Joe had no voice within the law.  Even if he was telling the truth, Sheriff Strother could not let him go free without proof of what he said was true.  Why would Strother believe him to be telling the truth anyway?

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2735,"title":"Proud, Patriotic Song of an Arkansas Colored Regiment","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Written in 1863 by the white Captain Lindley Miller, the First Arkansas Colored Regiment of the Union army proudly sang the Song of the First Arkansas to become excited for training and battle.According to Miller's notes, the marching song was sung to the tune of John Brown's Body, which is significant because they honored Brown, the well-known man who attempted a widespread slave insurrection in Harper's Ferry, Virginia in 1859.The song speaks for the patriotic, proud, and dedicated black soldier.The lyrics glorify the fight for de Union and de law.The black soldiers outright profess that they hab done with hoein' cotton and hoein' corn, and they demand they dey will hab to pay us wages, de wages ob their sin.The song incorporates many elements of abolitionist thought.It demands treatment from whites as equals, demanding that whites bow their foreheads to African Americans and a right to property.A political allusion to Father Abraham and his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 also exemplifies blacks' desire to attain the rights sanctioned to them by the government.Miller's song is a patriotic one, and it is revolutionary in its inclusion of blacks into the American sphere of citizenship.According to Ronald C.

Jewett, Arkansas was a state full of both Confederate and Union sympathies.It was, thus, not uncommon to see many blacks, as well as whites, eagerly fighting for the Union army and against their fellow statesmen of the Confederacy.Along the border South, dissension was common."," According to Mary Frances Berry, free and enslaved blacks were not allowed to enlist for the Union Army prior to 1863.Berry states that from 1863 to the end of the Civil War, black troops were heavily recruited and fought courageously.Berry points out that in May 1863, the Special Colored Troops Division was created within the War Department to recruit black soldiers.Berry describes that black troops, however, faced greater risks than white soldiers, as Confederate troops vowed to enslave captured blacks or to kill black soldiers and their officers even if they surrendered.While the First Arkansas Colored Regiment praised Lincoln's proclamation, these soldiers were at risk for their bold participation in battles.Berry notes that black enlistment numbers continued to rise, and Lincoln even commented that if enough blacks enlisted the Union would soon close the contest.Black soldiers, like those in this Arkansas regime, influenced the outcome of the Civil War in a large and symbolic way.Their sheer numbers and dedication to the cause of emancipation improved morale.Symbolically, however, these black soldiers not only sang of their freedom, they fought for their liberty and attained hard-earned respect.","--J.R."],"display_date":"1863 - 1865","search_date":"1864-07-01","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2741,"title":"Presbyterian Call for Secession Based on Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-11-29","end_date":"1860-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Writing from Ouachita, Louisiana on December 4, 1860, Sarah Lois Wadley, caught up in the sentiments of secession and northern oppression, describes a famous sermon delivered in New Orleans on November 29, 1860, which her father showed to her in writing. Delivered by Benjamin Morgan Palmer of the First Presbyterian Church, this sermon advocated southern secession in defense of its providential trust to perpetuate slavery. Palmer believed that slaves were by nature incapable of self government and dependent upon their masters for protection. Dr. Palmer's reasoning is sound, sensible, and Christian to Wadley who yearned for the South's fighting for the patriarchal cause of slavery. Dr. Palmer justified slavery through the patriarchy of a white slaveholder who protected the dependent slave. Wadley's opinions were typical of the Lower South during the days after Abraham Lincoln's presidential election, and sectionalism grew quickly and passionately, even in women's minds. According to Samuel S. Hill and Charles H. Lippy, Palmer's sermons on slavery, namely this famous oration, led to his position as the elected moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America. Wadley listened to Palmer with attentiveness and respect; she, like many other white southerners, believed in the doctrine of slavery as a divine right from God granted to the South. Wadley relates another sermon from a Dr. Lord, which summarizes the mistaken piety of abolitionists in their attempts to emancipate enslaved people from southern masters. Dr. Lord derived his preaching from Isaiah, and he condemned those who setting up their own judgement and their own code of morals instead of religion, and the scriptures, condemn that which has been sanctioned both by the bible, and by ancient usage. This sermon reflects the religious doctrine of southern clergymen prior to and possibly during the Civil War. Wadley had faith in what Palmer and Lord preached under the sanction of their church and under God."],"display_date":"November 29, 1860 - December 4, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-01","locations":[{"id":5608,"lat":32.4685930803,"lng":-92.1385872026,"zoom":9,"place":"OUACHITA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2763,"title":"Liberia and American Colonization Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-06-27","end_date":"1858-06-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After reading the works of John C. Calhoun on the rights of states and slavery, Susan Bradford Eppes spoke with her parents about enslavement. While her father supported slavery as a slave owner himself, Susan learned that her mother opposed the institution. Susan said that her mother believed that white slave owners were the real slaves in the relationship. Having slaves required added work and responsibility for slave holders that outweighed the benefits. It was her preference that all the slaves be freed and sent to Liberia. Susan responded to her mother by telling her that she would miss her slave, Lulu, if she were sent to Liberia. ","In 1816, the American Colonization Society was formed with the intentions of solving the race problems in the United States by relocating all blacks to Liberia. This organization and its cause became increasingly popular and reached its peak in the 1830s. While Mrs. Eppes spoke with her daughter almost two decades later, she recounted some of the beliefs that the Society put forward in support of colonization. They argued that being a slave holder was, in fact, an agonizing personal burden. The American Colonization Society said that not only was being a slave holder overly demanding, but simply freeing slaves was impossible. Whites and blacks could never live together in a peaceful society. The need to expatriate slaves demonstrated the obvious racism in the United States.

Waterman was in debt to Charles Seton for a couple of years. On June 11, 1823, the Superior Court of East Florida ordered the sheriff, James R. Hankam, to sell the slaves that belonged to Waterman. The slaves were supposed to be sold so that the proceeds would be used to pay off the debt owed to Seton. In addition, the court declared that if William Younge, a defendant in a related case, gave a security deposit for payment costs to Seton within sixty days, Waterman's slaves would be spared from being sold. Unfortunately for Waterman, Younge did not pay the security deposit by the sixtieth day, so on July 14, 1823, sheriff Hankam sold Waterman's slaves for two thousand three hundred and thirty dollars. Then, on November 5, 1823, sheriff Hankam filed a report with the clerk's office. The report showed that he had retained one thousand four hundred and sixty nine dollars and seventy two cents for fees and expenses that he acquired from selling the slaves. In addition, the report said he would deposit two promissory notes of three hundred and thirty five dollars. This, however, was not what Seton wanted to happen. Seton wanted all of the money to be given to him, so he filed a petition that asked the court to deliver the promissory notes in partial payment of the debt owed to him. Seton, also, reminded the court that the court appointed auditors had not met to determine and evaluate Hankam's fees. ","By May of 1824, Seton filed another petition to Judge Smith, which claimed that Joseph M. Hernandez and Edward R. Gibson, who were court appointed auditors to examine and report on an amount rendered and filed by sheriff Hankam, had been absent and never met to examine the amount filed. He, also, told the court that Judge Davis Floyd, another court appointed auditor, had been retained as counsel in the suit and declined to act as an auditor. Essentially, Seton's second petition asked the court to appoint another fit and judicious person to replace Judge Floyd as an auditor and to move the process of the audit along.","Seton's petition and case is a prime example of how the court process was sometimes slow and how it sometimes consumed lots of the petitioner's time. The county court did not always grant petitions to every case brought to its attention. Sometimes the loaner would not file a petition to get the debt paid off because the process would be long, arduous, and costly. If the debt was not large enough it would not be worth the time and money spent in court to get back a debt that would not amount to the cost of court fees and attorney fees. ","Another interesting issue shown in Seton's petition, was the security deposit that Younge had permission from the court to pay so Waterman's slave would not be sold. It was very possible for a person to get another person to pay off his debt. Even though the loaner would be paid off, the person who loaned the money and mortgaged his property, would now be in debt to another for paying off his original debt. Debt was a never ending cycle for some people. Those who mortgaged off their slaves and property needed to be careful and prepared to repay their debt or give up what he mortgaged to the loaner. The only other options the person in debt would have in the situation was to flee from his property and area to avoid paying his debts."],"display_date":"January 9, 1824 - May 6, 1824","search_date":"1824-03-07","locations":[{"id":1455,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST JOHNS, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2782,"title":"White Interference with the Slave System \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-08-19","end_date":"1842-08-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In August 1842, J. H. Arnold of Walton County, Georgia placed an announcement in the Athens Southern Banner offering a 50 reward to anyone who found his runaway slave. In most ways this ad was like any other runaway slave reward announcements. It reflected the basic ideology of slavery that the slave was property that rightfully belonged to its owner and should be returned if found.  In this particular ad, though, Arnold also recognized less visible characteristics of race relations in the antebellum South. In his announcement, Arnold speculated that the runaway was decoyed away by a white person and that he may obtain a free pass and leave the country.  ","What type of white person in Georgia in 1842 would have encouraged a slave to run away? Was this white person that Arnold suspects trying to take the slave for his or her own good or trying to help the slave escape?  Though we cannot determine what is the most likely answer to these questions for Arnold's case specifically, the possible answers demonstrate the complexity of race relations in the South from the onset of the Slave Trade in the South up to the Civil War.  ","It is plausible that Arnold feared that a slave trader kidnapped his slave to sell him somewhere else.  The slave trading business was an extensive system and we know that traders and bandits kidnapped slaves and free-blacks in order to sell them.  It also would have been logical for Arnold to fear abolitionist involvement in his slave's escape.  Part of the work of abolitionist groups in the antebellum North was to help blacks fleeing slavery to get safely to the North.  Though very secret at the time, we are now aware of an extensive system referred to as the Underground Railroad that was in place to assist runaway slaves.  Blacks and whites worked together to make the Underground Railroad function.  Whatever Arnold specifically feared about possible involvement in the disappearance of his slave, his fear is evidence that the white people interfered with the institution of slavery as well as upheld it.  Kidnapping slave traders and abolitionists posed threats to slaveholders' position of power in the system of slavery."],"display_date":"August 19, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-19","locations":[{"id":1655,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2838,"title":"What has been the practical effect of the Tariff of 1842?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-01-01","end_date":"1844-07-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mr. A.P Hayne, a slaveholder in Charleston, S.C, sent Isaac Hazard, a merchant from Peace Vale Rhode Island, to Warrenton to purchase a shipment of clothing and cloth for his slaves. After his purchases Isaac wrote to Hayne informing him of what he bought and each items price. His purchases included: 30 men's frock coats, twilled cotton and wool, at forty cents per yard, 12 boys coats, 175 yards of GDB cloth, and 175 yards of wool for women, both at forty eight cents per yard. The bill, which included other clothing materials, amounted to 100.  Isaac makes a defined effort to tell Hayne what materials remained at the same price from his trip the previous year, which was mainly the price per yard of cloth. Isaac did note that there were some increased changes in prices over the past year, to which he asks what the benefits of the Tariff of 1842 were, relating to the effects it had on the price of cloth. ","The Tariff Act of 1842 was passed in response to the Tariff Acts of 1832 and 1833, both of which imposed high duties on goods produced within the United States, including cotton and woolen goods. The Tariff Act of 1833 meant to gradually reduce duty rates, which it did, until 1842, when there was a drastic, forty-two percent drop in rates within a six-month period, down to twenty percent.  Duties were supposed to remain at this rate indefinitely, but only lasted two months, due to a quarrel between the Whig Party and President Tyler, which had caused them to separate.  The Tariff Act of 1842 got caught up in the eventual agreement made between the two, which caused the duties to be higher than the original twenty percent rate.  Consequently, the public was not very enthused about the tariff, as they realized that it did not conform to the wishes of the manufacturers, but rather those of the politicians. ","While the Tariff of 1842 meant to protect the American cotton textile industry, it was not as effective in its actual application. Isaac Hazard asked what the practical effect of the tariff had been, because he had not seen any results from it.  At the time, in comparison to the price of equivalent fabric in Great Britain, domestic fabric in the United States cost twenty percent more.  Despite this, it must be noted that without the tariff many American textile companies would not have survived.  This is because the United State's industry was technologically behind Great Britain's. So, Isaac Hazard's complaint to his boss was largely a lost one, in that while textile prices could have been better than they were there was a cap on how much they could improve.

On vacation she went to Mobile, Alabama where she met up with her friend Edith Whitfield. Whitfield lived on the plantation of her father, General Nathan Whitfield. In writing about her experience, Bryan described the nearly 900 slaves on the plantation. In her observations, Bryan decided that the slaves were all happy and polite on the elaborate plantation with everything one could possibly desire. ","The description Bryan provided is emblematic of the overall belief in the South that slavery was the best thing for black people. In fact, many went so far as to say that enslaved people enjoyed and depended on slavery. Slavery was a relationship between masters and slaves and both parties benefited. Slaves received guidance while masters received happy and loyal workers. While Bryan was not the owner of 900 slaves, she believed as the Whitfields did that the slaves were better off with masters providing for them than on their own. Masters were patriarchs who protected their slaves who were simply inferior from birth. Bryan chose not elaborate too heavily on the condition of the slaves, but rather dismissed their happiness as normal. The Sambo stereotype of enslaved people implied that slaves were happy and good-natured in addition to lazy and ignorant. Bryan's observations fell inline with traditional southern views of blacks and therefore did not require any further explanation. ","In the minds of many slave holders, slaves were simply a part of white families and a responsibility for masters. An observation on the happiness of the slaves reflected more on the strength and character of the masters than the slaves themselves. Slaves were a symbol of status throughout the Deep South; the more slaves someone had, the more respected they were. Masters were not just judged solely on the quantity of slaves; a good master ensured that the slaves were productive and happy. While Bryan's casual observation initially seems trivial, she portrayed the traditional stereotype of enslaved people throughout the South. She also commented on the strength and character of her friends the Whitfields. Based on her description of numerous, happy slaves, one can assume that the Whitfields were of high status in Mobile, Alabama.

In recounting her story, Louisa Picquet discussed the races of slaves on several occasions. As a slave, Louisa recognized differences between herself and other slaves. She described herself as relatively white, but that other slaves around her where more white than she. She also noticed a difference in the way masters treated their perfectly white slaves and their jet black slaves. Masters preferred their slaves to be more white than black, though no matter how white a slave was, it was not good enough. For example, Louisa described her mother as pretty white; not white enough for white people. ","After describing race in Mobile from her perspective, Louisa described a particular situation on a plantation where her friend worked. A white and black slave both served as waitmen for their master. The master preferred the white slave and the black slave was jealous and plotted against him. He told his master that the white waitman had sexual relations with the almost-white female slave the master kept for his own. The jet black slave knew this was the only thing for which his master would beat the white slave. His assumptions were correct, and the white slave was heavily beaten and sold. The black slave knew that the only way he could gain favor was to charge the white waitman with a crime the master could not ignore. ","As Africans were shipped to the United States in greater numbers, race could no longer be simply white or black. Relationships between white masters and female slaves, or even in rare cases black freemen and white women, produced racial complexity. In fact, in Virginia there were as many as 61 different ways to describe skin tones. No matter how white a person appeared, if they had any African ancestors, they could be enslaved. However, the whiter a slave was, the more desirable they were to their masters. In the case Louisa described, this was true for both male and female slaves. In the female case, masters preferred whiter slaves for their own desires. With men, masters simply preferred keeping whiter slaves closer to them. This is a theme throughout the South as law makers and community members continually had to define what it meant to be white or black in a land where very few people could be definitively defined as one or the other."],"display_date":1861,"search_date":"1861-07-02","locations":[{"id":285,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2862,"title":"Reactions to Lincoln&#39;s Inauguration\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-01","end_date":"1861-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Lincoln was inaugurated on March 4, 1861. One month earlier, Jefferson Davis had been inaugurated as the new president of the Confederacy. Elizabeth Saxon traveled to Montgomery, Alabama to celebrate the inauguration of Davis and then traveled to Mobile when Lincoln was inaugurated. In Mobile, she visited with a good friend and mentor from her childhood, Madame Octavia Walton Invert. Well-educated and charming, Madame Invert was a woman of society. Saxon described her as the most generous person she had ever met. The two exchanged formalities and then discussed Lincoln's present inauguration with sadness and fear. Invert cried for the friends she had scattered throughout the North and the South and knew how difficult the upcoming months would be. Saxon was younger and saw more hope for the future. Yet the depression of her role model was greatly troubling, and the somber mood quickly spread to Elizabeth herself. ","Uncertainty surrounded Lincoln's inauguration. Unionists and Confederates found themselves unsure of what would happen next. His inauguration speech needed to alleviate fears and explain his positions and possible actions. In his speech, Lincoln proclaimed that his purpose was not to eliminate slavery but rather oversee that which belonged to the government. In this sense, he was referring to the states that had already seceded. This included Saxon's home state of Alabama, which had seceded on January 11, 1861. Lincoln argued that he had no intentions of ending slavery in the South, but simply wanted to preserve the Union. ","Despite Lincoln's reassurances, southerners were not convinced. Many believed that slavery could not be protected in the current Union regardless of who was in charge. States that had already seceded continued to encourage border states to join their new nation. Even though states like Alabama had already taken action, no one knew what Lincoln's response would be. When he refused to sit idly by and allow the South to create its own nation, war became the next possible step. While the border states did not seceded until April and May, the rest of the South knew that war was coming. Unlike the inauguration of Jefferson Davis, the inauguration of Lincoln was a somber occasion. Invert's wisdom led her to believe that war between the North and the South was next and that would mean great casualties on both sides. Though younger, Saxon realized a great deal from watching the depression Invert faced. She too came to believe that the Confederate States of America would have to fight to preserve themselves.

As the war progressed, Union armies came closer and closer to his hometown until ultimately they came through and destroyed Panola. Masters feared for their lives and their property and decided to send some of their slaves further south and away from the Yankees. Hughes and his wife were part of a group initially sent to Georgia.

For blacks, this was a way of guaranteeing freedom and showing patriotism. Clearly southerners feared this. They accused Lincoln of inciting slave rebellions and violating laws of war.

In a period of three months in 1862, large groups of slaves armed with cane knives, clubs, and old guns stole horses and mules and marched to the city. There they bypassed rebel pickets and fought battles with policemen. The fortunate ones eluded capture and found refuge in Union army camps, others were beaten or sentenced to three months hard labor.","Throughout the war, many slaves followed Union armies.

On March 17, 1864, the military mayor reported that the colored population was generating disease by living in crowded, unsuitable huts and disregarded the laws of health. The Union officers and General Banks took whatever measures were available to compensate for the large numbers of starving, unemployed, and penniless African Americans in New Orleans.","Although these African Americans filled many positions in the army, they were not permitted to fight alongside their white male counterparts. In August 1862, General Butler decided to enlist free black men into his army to gather more troops. Despite the fact the many African Americans were willing to sacrifice their lives in the army, white people still believed that they would not survive without the paternalistic guidance of their owners.

Furthermore, next to each slave's name he wrote descriptions. Not physical descriptions but personality traits. Manigault deemed Jacob smart and intelligent and Plato he thought to be good and trusty; however, his praises stopped with Young John when he described him as lazy and Moses as slow and complaining. Manigault commented on his slaves' characters and personalities, not just their working abilities. He called Bob slow, honest, good. These traits have very little to do with work ethic and mostly with character."," It's not personal, it's business has become a mantra for much of the twentieth-century corporate world. Slave owners in the early nineteenth century, however, did not have the luxury of making that distinction because they were dealing with inherently personal things: humans. Charles Manigault displayed this fascinating balance between humanity and business in many of the records he kept of his plantation, as seen in these records. Slaveholders all had to navigate between the fact that their slaves were human and the fact that they were possessions. Many slaveholders did so by recognizing families and marriages within the plantation, by giving slaves measured freedom during their few days off, and by acknowledging such humanizing characteristics such as temperament and work ethic. Slaveholders did, however, repress this humanity in their slaves. They did so through whippings and constant verbal reminders to their slaves of their enslavement, and very few slaveholders to take familial ties into account when contemplating whether or not to sell a slave. "," This repression of enslaved people's humanity had two purposes. The first purpose was to keep slaves enslaved. By constantly suppressing their humanity and treating them as objects, many slaves learned to act as such, at least towards their masters. This deference and servility most likely made the day to day operations of the plantation far easier. The second purpose of the repression of humanity was for slaveholders' own consciences. Had slaveholders dwelled on the humanity of those people whom they were forcibly enslaving, slavery would not have continued. Instead slaveholders reduced their slaves to only partly human, seeing them as children they had to care for not humans they were enslaving. "," This paradox of understanding slaves' humanity as well as treating them as possessions applied to every slaveholder as well as to many non slaveholders who upheld this system of slavery and paternalism.

In speaking to the Calliopean and Polytechnic Societies at the Citadel Academy in Charleston in 1853, Yeadon took the opportunity to address the audience on what would happen if higher institutions in South Carolina did not maintain strict discipline among their pupils.","Stemming from God, Order is the great law of nature, whereas Insubordination or rebellion was the primal sin, which drove [man] from Paradise. In the United States, Yeadon noted, order takes the place of the sword of power, pervading, ruling, and harmonizing our political system, which leads to the people of the United States literally reveling in the enjoyment of a political Eden, a national Paradise. But he cautioned, without order, we would be torn by civil dissensions, beyond all other nations, as the necessary result of our division into separate States...and we would soon behold our great and glorious Union, now covering a continent with its nationality and with the ample folds of our starry banner, broken into warring fragments, unable to command peace at home or respect abroad, and a derision and a by-word among nations. ","Yeadon's was a timely lesson. In 1853, only 11 students graduated from the College of Columbia, and nary a soul from the Citadel. It is manifest that a spirit of insubordination among our youth is not only at the bottom of these deplorable results, Yeadon concluded, but that it has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. ","There are several reasons he gave for why this spirit of insubordination ought to be diminished, but the last was the most telling: The nature of our institution of domestic slavery, and its exposure of us to hostile machinations, both at home and abroad, render it doubly incumbent on us, and on our whole sisterhood of Southern States, to cherish a military spirit and diffuse military science among our people.... Thus prepared and harnessed for conflict...the South, the united South, self-sustained and self-defended, and thrice armed, as having her quarrel just, may defy the world in arms. ","One can almost hear his voice rising to a crescendo on these last words. Yet it was November 23, 1853. War would not break out between the states for over seven more years. But one would think from listening to Richard Yeadon's speech that the armies were marching to Charleston that instant. And the main reason for preserving order in the South's colleges: the threat of external attack on the South's peculiar institution. ","This episode supports historian Arthur Cole and others who believe there existed in South Carolina in the 1850s the danger of a rupture of the Union and of civil war ten years before the firing of the first gun on Fort Sumter when even sober-minded southerners...began to calculate the value of the Union. In November 1853, Richard Yeadon was clearly calculating, and used his podium as a conduit to warn a younger generation."],"display_date":"November 23, 1853","search_date":"1853-11-23","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2901,"title":"Breastfeeding\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1835-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the days before baby formula, new mothers had far fewer options for food for their babies. Because of rampant childhood diseases and absence of many other options of sustenance for infants, breastmilk played a vitally important role in the development of society and families. Many slaveholding women designated enslaved women to be wet nurses for the newly born white children. As Robert Mallard describes in his memoir, As a babe, I drew a part at least of my nourishment from the generous breasts of a colored foster mother. Growing up on a plantation in Georgia, Mallard was certainly one of many young children who were cared for primarily by slaves instead of his own parents. "," This use of enslaved women as wet nurses caused a great deal of debate among Southerners. Many slave holding women did not even see nursing their children as part of their normal responsibilities as mothers. Other women however did look upon this practice with a skeptical and critical eye. In one woman's judgment, 'that woman is but half a mother who does not suckle her own children'","Many southerners were disconcerted by this practice of allowing an enslaved woman to be the primary care taker, however, Mallard felt quite differently. He wrote that his colored foster mother...always held a peculiar place in my regards. A black nurse taught me, it is probable, my first steps and first words, and was as proud of both performances as the happy mother herself. Mallard clearly has an ambiguous relationship with his wet nurse, as he shows by choosing the word peculiar to describe it. Enslaved women acting as wet nurses also had tenuous feelings toward their job as nurse. Most slave women who had children of their own were only allowed one or two months away from their duties before their masters required them to return to work, leaving their children with another slave. Being deprived of time with their own children, enslaved women must have resented time with their slave master's children. In Stephen V. Ash's book A Year in the South: 1865, he describes how Matilda Hughes, an enslaved woman, had to work so much that her twins died because she was unable to breastfeed them often enough. If enslaved women's children died of neglect, how must they have felt when asked to care for other children? But other historians have asserted that often, slave women caring for white children did form strong attachments with these children. This contradiction between motherhood and slavery lies at the heart of Mallard's narrative, and, though Mallard might have seen his childhood through rose colored glasses, this ambiguity unsettled the very core of the domestic household in the South."],"display_date":"1830 - 1835","search_date":"1832-12-31","locations":[{"id":1991,"lat":31.6671183532,"lng":-81.1853351386,"zoom":9,"place":"LIBERTY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2908,"title":"Our Father, Who Art in Heaven","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-01-01","end_date":"1826-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Little Robert Anderson stuttered as he sat on the dirt floor of his slave cabin at his grandmother's feet. Over and over again, he painfully tried to recite the Lord's Prayer, but each time he failed. First, he could not remember how it began. After a hint from his grandmother, he ran into trouble with the latter parts. After many long, frustrating hours, his grandmother, with a pained expression on her face, tied Robert up by his hands and whipped his small back, all the while praying that her grandson would be able to memorize his prayer. "," Years later, Anderson recalled this event when writing his memoir. His account demonstrates the high premium some slaves placed on religion, because of the hope it offered. Anderson's grandmother clearly valued her grandson's learning the Lord's Prayer, if she was willing to whip him over it. "," Christianity offered enslaved people hope. The promise of a better life after this helped slaves defend themselves against the psychological horrors of being property. Anderson's grandmother obviously saw the necessity of this hope and was therefore to do whatever it took to give her grandson access to this hope. When Anderson finally did learn his prayer, though the necessity for this sense of hope was lost on such a young boy, he was, as glad as you ever saw a little fellow. After buying his freedom from his master, Anderson became a renowned and respected pastor, so this incident clearly shaped his life. "," This memorization was, in fact, quite disconcerting for slaveholders. Though most slaves in the South could not read, they did know several significant passages from the Bible, including the Lord's Prayer as well as other, not so innocuous (at least in the slaveholders' eyes), verses about freedom, equality, and the poor. By memorizing these verses, enslaved people combined the oral tradition of their African culture with the Christian religion they had been exposed to in America. This combination gave enslaved people hope and a way to constantly remind themselves of this hope.

The diversity of these intellectual societies is astounding, often catering to a single ethnic group. In Charleston during the mid-1800s, one could find the St. Andrew's Society for Scotch-Irish, the Hibernian Society or the St. Patrick Society for Catholic Irish (not to be confused with the Catholic French, who had the French Benevolent Society), the Hebrew Harmonic Society for Jews, the South Carolina Society for Huguenots, and the German Friendly Society for Germans. And for a while, even free blacks could participate in their own Clionian Debating Society. ","Still, white, Protestant males dominated the intellectual life in nineteenth century Charleston, often forming their own exclusive societies. One example was the Charleston Conversation Club. Founded in 1800, the club met in private homes during the season (typically November through May) where one member would make a speech, followed by a two-hour discussion, and concluding with a dinner. All the popular political and social issues were discussed, as well as the occasional foray into literature or history. For example, the first six topics in the 1854-1855 season were Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, poetry (written by a Society member), Parish Representation, political representation, Grayson's The Hireling and the Slave, and the destiny of negroes in the South. ","Such was the framework in 1855 when an accidental meeting of several gentleman, at one of those old homesteads, in the vicinity of Charleston occurred. The result, on June 2, was the creation of the South Carolina Historical Society and the approval of a constitution drafted by Dr. James Moultrie and Professors W. J. Rivers and F. A. Porcher. In 1856, the state of South Carolina incorporated the Society, and by 1857, the Society had secured the means to publish the first volume of The Collections of the Historical Society of South Carolina. The first volume was innocuous enough, including rather harmless topics like an address to the Society by Professor Porcher, a College of Charleston history professor. Yet by 1859 the conversations had changed drastically. In a May 19 oration to the Society-a speech reprinted in the third volume of the Collections-Second Vice President William Trescot took the opportunity to make a few remarks on the institution of slavery. Trescot's message was in line with most Southern thinkers of the day. Slavery was the great leveler, making a society of equals, by elevating all citizens of the State to the condition of a privileged class. It was an institution that knit together its members in their various conditions into one harmonious whole and made South Carolinians a grave, earnest, resolute, just people. ","This episode is important in highlighting the origins of ideas in the nineteenth century South: ordinary citizens, typical Charleston residents discussing typical Charleston issues among peers. In the words of historian Michael O'Brien, they were an urbane intelligentsia, not a workshop of experts. Their ideas were their own, though those often trickled down through newspapers and day-to-day conversation to ultimately reflect-as Trescot's did-opinions held by society at large. Ideas like his on the justness of slavery ultimately dominated the debates in all the aforementioned societies in Charleston during this time, and succeeded in casting a shadow over subsequent literary discussion."],"display_date":"June 2, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-02","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2914,"title":"While They Were Sleeping\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-08-21","end_date":"1831-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a Sunday night in mid-August, Joseph Travis slept peacefully next to his wife in the home they shared with their three children. The couple had just borne an infant, who that night was sleeping soundly, giving the parents a chance to rest undisturbed. The husband awoke to a sharp blow to his head, shot up out of bed, and called out to his wife. Mrs. Travis awoke to see her husband cut down with an axe and quickly shared his fate. The Travis family was the first of many families to meet an untimely end on the night leading into the morning of August 22, 1831. Nat Turner and a horde of other slaves and free blacks led a crusade against whites, which Turner claimed to be divinely inspired and mandated. He led the way with a dulled cutlass that acted as little more than a blunt piece of steal. At one point in the night, Turner was repeatedly unsuccessful in killing a woman with blows from this weapon, and resorted instead to bludgeons from a loosed fencepost. ","Turner soon gained notoriety among whites as a fanatic preacher who had used his tremendous powers of persuasion to garner his following; His confessor noted him as possessing tremendous mental acuity. He described himself being considered prophetic from an early age, destined for great things.

In The Commonwealth vs. Nat Turner, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the stated charges of making insurrection, and plotting to take away the lives of divers free white persons, &c. He explained his plea of 'not guilty' on the grounds that he did not feel so. The common belief at the time was that Nat Turner and the rest of the slaves in Southampton County were like spoiled children who, given too much in youth, grew up to think themselves worthy to rule all they saw. This sentiment, reified by the Southampton Insurrection, led to more stringent laws toward both slaves and free blacks across the South.

Rix of Raleigh, NC, eighteen of his slaves were freed from bondage on the condition that they boarded a ship sailing from Norfolk, VA to the west coast of Africa. One of the eighteen took a stand against these terms, and was resold into slavery. The idea for the resettlement of blacks in Africa began as a way for whites to rid themselves of African American presence to counterbalance ever increasing numbers of free blacks living on American soil. The public image that organizations such as the American Colonization Society presented was one of compassion and of Christian values. Soon it became clear that although there were pockets of blacks who looked positively on the idea of colonization, there were a great many others who questioned the professed philanthropy of its [white] promoters. Blacks who did support the movement often did so only when they decided whites would never allow them to claim full and equal citizenship. Many states, including Virginia, had instituted laws forcing freed slaves to exit the state; Furthermore, Georgia had created a system set on deterring blacks from immigrating to their state by giving free blacks the option of a 500 entrance fee or sale into slavery. ","It quickly became clear that Christian benevolence toward a debased and oppressed race was not the driving force for the movement, but rather a deep-seeded White fear of the growing free black population. John Rix's terms of manumission were not unique. The Colored American, a New York City-based African American newspaper, reported seven other conditionally freed slaves that were to join these seventeen on the ship Saluda, bound for Africa. The Norfolk Harbor was a microcosm of a nationally growing trend at this time. From 1820-1830, 1430 blacks boarded ships such as the Saluda bound for Liberia. In 1832 alone, that number rose to 1037-247 of which were manumitted under the condition of emigration.

This was not selling off a single slave for disciplinary purposes. Nobody seemed to mind the mass sale of slaves, as Richmond was the largest upper South market for slave trading going south in the antebellum years. Unknown in this case, though, is whether all slaves were sold separately at the time of the sale, or if they were freely broken up and given to the highest bidder. Also, it is unclear as to why Spain was selling the enslaved peoples, for if he raised them all himself it would seem that he was not a slave trader by trade. What is known for sure is that this sale of fifty negroes was not out of the ordinary in the upper South's leading slave market."],"display_date":"January 23, 1816","search_date":"1816-01-23","locations":[{"id":13912,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2927,"title":"Days of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-12-05","end_date":"1860-11-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There was always a crisis in the 1850s, at least in the minds of the citizens of Charleston. On December 6, 1850, William H. Barnwell, rector of St. Peter's Church, took the pulpit to expand upon the great political question which is agitating our country. The occasion? A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, as designated by the South Carolina legislature. The great political question? Slavery, especially in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, a compromise most South Carolinians viewed as an absolute defeat for the South. ","Barnwell was very clear on his stance: The purpose of the North is to use the whole power of the Government for its own aggrandizement, and the destruction of an institution which we believe to be of vital importance to our welfare. The institution for Barnwell, though, was not just important for South Carolina's welfare-it was ordained by God and a gift to the African race. His ultimate conclusion, though (the morality of slavery aside) remained political: Whatever speculative notions any one may have as to the moral influence of slavery, that it is a fundamental institution of the Southern States, and that no Government on earth has the slightest right to meddle with it, either directly or indirectly.","Turn to November 21, 1860. This time, South Carolina Governor William Gist had proclaimed another Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer. This time, it was Reverend Thomas Smyth lecturing at Second Presbyterian Church on The Sin and the Curse. This time, it was the election of Abraham Lincoln and a growing secession movement that prompted the occasion. It was all a foregone conclusion in Smyth's mind: This is only the result,-the consummation of a tragedy which has been long progressing to its last act,-when the curtain fell upon the dismembered body of the Union. He goes on to blame Northern Christians for this situation; they pervert truth, justice, honor, and good faith by forgetting that the condition of slavery has been and is recognized and regulated by God, who first ordained that it should come to pass as a penal infliction upon a guilty race, for the mitigation of greater evils, and for the good of all... that under the fostering care of these Southern States, and of this legally bounded institution, these people have multiplied in a ratio greater than their masters; that they are healthier and happier than any other laboring class on the face of the earth. ","This episode is important in showing the fusion of religion and politics in 1850s South Carolina. The views of these two pastors also aligned with those in the rest of the South. As Charles Iron of Elon University notes, By the 1830s, Southern whites insisted in their formulation of a regional, evangelical orthodoxy that God had ordained slavery and that slaveholders could confidently hold their property in persons so long as they were attentive to the spiritual condition of their slaves. Though these two sermons were ten years apart, the themes they espouse and the justifications for slavery they promulgate remained the same."],"display_date":"December 5, 1850 - November 21, 1860","search_date":"1855-11-28","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2931,"title":"Colonization Movement\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-12-19","end_date":"1836-12-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 19, 1836, Philo, an anonymous member of the Norfolk community, tried to spur popular support for the resettlement of blacks in Africa.

As more and more slaves became citizens, whites increasingly took note. Successful free blacks posed a threat to the social hierarchy, specifically the institution of slavery. Much of White America, Philo included, took a paternalistic approach, using rhetoric of compassion in their approach to resettlement.

This sort of attitude affected the African Americans' views of themselves in relation to the native Africans with whom they were to cohabitate. The repercussions of this forced emigration and assimilation into Liberia have stretched across the last two hundred years and are still present today in the civil wars that plague that nation.

He writes that at the slave markets, consumers are often able to maintain a moral high ground in comparison to the traders, however misguided. However, in this example we see that even slave owners who are not engaged in the African slave trade often exhibit the same disregard for the needs or wants of their slaves. Thinly-veiled attempts at humane treatment are not enough to conceal the truly vicious nature of slavery. However, Johnson's book focuses mainly on New Orleans in the antebellum period, and this episode took place in Virginia in the midst of the Civil War. This may explain Wyatt's assertiveness - the Emancipation Proclamation had actually gone into affect four days earlier and many slaves pressed for their rights even when resentful masters and slave traders refused to grant them. In fact, in many states in the deeper South, slaves often did not even find out they had been emancipated until after the war ended. However, Virginia's proximity to the North and Washington, D.C. made it difficult for owners to conceal the news of emancipation.

Stowing away on a boat would allow a slave to hide and wait until arrival in the north, which was much more desirable than being in a constant chase with their masters.

A neighboring estate had lost two slaves to the illness as well.","Those living in slave quarters were highly vulnerable to infection, which spread easily among slaves with poor hygiene, living in close, unventilated buildings. Flies transmitted the disease from infected fecal matter, which was often disposed of too close to housing structures. Potable water was often unavailable. According to John Vlach, one Mississippi planter described the average slave accommodation as well-calculated to generate disease. The planters were generally aware of this risk; they knew that slave dwellings would ideally be clean, ventilated, and far apart. Slaveholders, however, often deemed the effort to improve living conditions too costly and time consuming to be worthwhile.","Malnutrition, which was standard for many African Americans in the South, was another possible cause of typhoid death in slave populations. An essay written by a Georgia planter-physician, also in Vlach's book, refers to an 1850 typhoid outbreak near Brookes' plantation and during the same year that Sonbeck wrote this letter. The physician claims that slave violence over food caused the highly contagious fever, and when the slaves were given a nourishing diet, the diseased stopped spreading. This outbreak may not have been related to the one in question, but slaves were certainly more susceptible to disease when their immune systems were weakened by malnutrition. ","Other factors may have contributed to the slave's death as well. For instance, plantation owners generally made all medical decisions concerning their slaves and medical expenses, so Brookes' absence during the time of the outbreak may have slowed the process of procuring medical treatment. Slaves also were often denied medical care if the overseers believed they were faking their illness, and exhaustion from being overworked could weaken the immune system. ","Plantation owners and their overseers often had notoriously bad relationships, and Sonbeck's letter suggests a fear that his master would blame him for the death of his slave. He hopes that the other nearby typhoid deaths will exonerate him from blame, and indeed, Sonbeck probably was not at fault. The deceased's slave's status, however, probably did cause his illness and eventually his death.

Hay described Manuel as broad shouldered and well formed, along with giving his height and other physical characteristics, his clothing, and his likely whereabouts (Northamberland, where he had bought Manuel in 1814). He also mentioned a mark on Manuel's head, given according to Hay, by a blow recently given him by one of his fellow servants. "," Hay's last sentence is interesting in two regards. One is that Hay went out of his way to state that the blow was given by a fellow servant. Whether or not this is true (it is entirely possible that Hay himself was responsible for the blow, as the physical abuse of slaves was prevalent), this wording was likely used to avoid a situation where another would find Manuel and take pity on him for being an abused slave. Secondly, he used the word servant to describe Manuel. Richmond (in comparison to other parts of the south) in the early 1800s was not an especially harsh environment for a slave or any African-American. Also, in other texts in the <em>Enquirer </em>this term is used for slave. Thus it is likely that some of the people were not in favor of slavery. By using the word servant as opposed to slave, Hay attempts to avoid bringing up the moral issue of slavery to those people whom he hopes will assist in returning his lost property."," Also interesting is that Hay posted this reward in the <em>Enquirer </em>multiple times (it shows up again on August 9, 12, 23, and 30). Fifty dollars was a substantial sum in 1815, one of the higher rewards offered for a runaway slave, and the fact that Hay would offer that type of reward, as well as continue to buy space in the newspaper to advertise this fact, shows how valuable a slave was for a white person.

Many petitions were made, but few granted, especially in the wake of the Nat Turner Rebellion.

For example, when Billy Pugh, a slave owned by the Overseers of the Poor of Norfolk County, was recommended for such a dispensation in December 1832, he was denied; This man had spent thirty years of his life raising several thousand dollars for the poor, and his only reward was the option to leave his home continent for Africa. Only three former slaves were permitted to stay in Virginia during the mid-1930s, all of whom were elderly and had provided significant service to the white population. The economy of Norfolk at this time was inextricably tied with slavery. Most enslaved men were considered semi-skilled or skilled workers, and the women filled scores of domestic positions.

Gooch wrote a letter in the winter of 1825 on the issue of slaveholding in Virginia and the South. Gooch believed that the subject of slaveholding states rights' was not getting enough attention from southern politicians. Throughout the letter Gooch argued against the intrusive interference of our northern neighbors on that of slaves, saying that they knew nothing of the cultural state of things among us [the South]. He also argued that there is little difference in the state of African-Americans in the north and the south, except that of political rights, which were hardly rights in the north. Slaves had better lives than their poor northern brethren, he stated. Gooch did not defend slavery's virtues in this letter; instead he argued against the north forcing its ways upon the south. He even stated that the southern states themselves are affording a devise gradually to get rid of the evil [slavery], but that they were doing it their way, on their time. At the end of his letter, he focused on the independence of Virginia as a state, and that as such the state has its own rights to run things the way it sees fit, under its own timetable."," In this letter much is seen about the way Virginians thought of the institution of slavery in the first half of the nineteenth century. While slavery in the inner-city of Richmond was not embraced as it was in much of the plantation south, Virginians still defended their right to have it everywhere, and resented the northern states attempting to end it. Gooch's statement that the northerners know nothing of the state of things in the south (and that slaves were better off than their northern counterparts) showed that southerners in Virginia honestly have believed that their institution of slavery was not in fact the evil it was made out to be. At the end of his letter, Gooch's emphasis on Virginia as a state and the rights that it thus had foreshadowed the Civil War that was still over thirty years away. The attitude that the northern states could not tell the southern states what to do, specifically with regard to slavery, would eventually be a key factor in dividing the country and leading to war. This would be very important in Virginia, a border state in the North-South conflict. Here these feelings of state's rights showed up long before anyone could even have imagined an event on the scale of the Civil War taking place.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

Vermillion by a runaway slave sparked a manhunt in Fairfax County.  The slave, owned by Mr. William Brawner of Prince William County, had not gotten very far when Mr. Vermillion caught him near his house, Pleasant Valley, in Fairfax County. Upon apprehending the runaway, Mr. Vermillion was going to take him to the magistrate for a proper conviction and return to his master, as in due process. The slave, having had a small taste of freedom, could not bear the thought of returning to slavery, prompting him to murder Mr. Vermillion in an attempt to escape yet again.  As this attempt was successful, the slave became both a runaway and a murderer. Whether the runaway was ever caught is unknown.  If he were, he undoubtedly would have been executed for his crimes.  Slaves had very little voice in the judicial system.  Even if the runaway killed Mr. Vermillion unintentionally the likelihood of his conviction and subsequent execution was very high. ","At the center of this narrative is the psychological damage that slavery had on slaves.  They were stripped down mentally and dehumanized in such a way, that freedom was their only real option to a harrowing real life.  This slave was not the only one who cracked under the constrictions and hardships of slavery, which worked to bolster white supremacy. In his book Soul by Soul, historian Walter Johnson makes the point that slaves were no more than commodities.  The process of dehumanization that took place to turn them into objects rather than people was both mentally and physically destructive.  In addition to this, the disciplining of slaves was rarely punishable in court, regardless of how severe.  Courts were even reluctant to chastise abusive slave owners as long as their behavior did not affect the community. Thus, slaves themselves could not charge their master with abuse; someone else in the community would have to bring the case to court. While this directly shows the how little the law represented it also gives insight into how harmful owners could be to their slaves without punishment.  These things combined provided the slaves with a lifestyle that not all could handle.

All African Americans had to have a written pass issued by the individual's owner or trustee. The office and the conductor both required a copy of it, and if the office was not familiar with the signature, the owner or trustee had to physically present themselves and prove that they had 'lawful control' over the individual.","Although Macon and Western specifically announced that they would enforce this policy, the practice of requiring blacks to have a pass was commonplace even off of the railroad. African Americans traveling without one were often arrested under the presumption that they were runaway slaves, and then bore the burden of proving that they were free or otherwise behaving lawfully.","The apparent purpose of the law was to deter slaves from running away and to catch those that were foolish enough to do so. Very few runaway slaves, however, actually attempted to use the railroads as a mode of transportation. If they did, they had to disguise themselves or successfully forge a pass in order to avoid being caught. Apprehended runaway slaves were severely punished and sometimes killed or sold to planters in the Deep South, where plantation conditions were even worse and escaping was nearly impossible. Because of the difficulties and risks involved, runaway slaves more frequently utilized hiding spaces in wagons, boats, and ships. Much of the traveling was done on foot through unpopulated fields and mountains where the risk of apprehension was lower.","The railroad companies and slaveholders were aware of this, and so it is likely that the real purpose of this policy was to deter free blacks from staying in the South, where their rights were severely limited and their freedom often questioned. Slave catchers were heavily compensated for capturing runaway slaves, and would often apprehend free blacks and even sell them back into slavery for the monetary rewards.

Wiltberger, while sitting at breakfast one morning, was interrupted by his overseer. The overseer angrily informed Wiltberger that Jane, one of Wiltberger's slaves, was missing. Other slaves were being questioned but so far, the overseer could find out nothing. Incensed, Wiltberger questioned his slaves further, but to no avail. He then picked up his pen and proceeded to write an advertisement to the Argus, the Savannah newspaper, calling on all whites to help him regain his property. He offered a 50 reward for the capture of his slave. He described her as a Mulatto Female Slave, named JANE, about eighteen years of age-5 feet two or three inches high-stout and well made-a pleasing and intelligent countenance-long jet black hair. The ad first appeared on July 14, and two months later, was still being printed in every issue of the newspaper. "," Wiltberger's description of Jane does a great deal to reveal why Jane had been successful in evading capture thus far. First, he described her as mulatto meaning that she had lighter skin than most enslaved people. Often, potential slave buyers were hesitant to buy lighter skinned slaves because they had a better chance of successfully escaping. Also, once away, a lighter skinned African American would have a better chance of blending into white society. Wiltberger's ad and the length of time it stayed in the newspaper, both demonstrate the basis on which these fears were founded. Wiltberger also described her as having a pleasing and intelligent countenance. Because many white southerners associated whiteness with intelligence and blackness with ignorance, lighter skinned slaves proved more of a liability and a threat to slaveholders because they were thought to be more intelligent and thus more able to run away."," One of a slaveholder's biggest concerns when debating whether or not to buy a slave was if that slave would run away or not. Many For Sale ads in newspapers made a point of stating that the slave being advertised would never run away. This emphasis shows what a huge issue it was in slave society and the lengths to which a slaveholder would go to in order to regain his property. Jane might not have been perceived as such a huge liability initially, however, because of her gender. Seventy-five percent of runaways were male, simply because female slaves gave birth and had the responsibilities of motherhood so early in life. Jane, at age 18, might already have had children that she was abandoning in her bid for freedom. Her gender also, no doubt, helped in her success because a black woman was perceived as far less of a threat than a black man in the South; therefore, she would likely have had an easier time blending into a crowd. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether Jane got away, or whether Wiltberger's ad succeeded.

They further expressed their opinion that the law would not be enforced in the state, except in cases of malicious and spiteful intent on some slaveholders' parts to punish men better than themselves. The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance.

However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon.

Several years earlier a South Carolina citizen by the name of George Ford had been murdered by a slave named Joe (also called Forest) owned by a Mr. Carroll of Richland County. Both Mr. Ford's relatives, as well as the state, offered more than 1,000 dollars for the capture of the runaway slave, but no one was successful in apprehending him. Joe was actually so successful in evading capture that he arose as a leadership figure for other runaway slaves in the area, and established a camp of criminal runaways in the depths of the local swamp."," The local citizens had continued to grow more and more uneasy about the presence of this camp of slaves in their community, fearing the group was planning a large scale insurrection. They had petitioned the state and Commander- in- Chief to call in proper military forces to dispel the rebellious camp. When the state did not respond to their requests they took matters into their own hands and formed a civilian militia, intent on finding and eliminating the threat themselves. The expedition was unsuccessful until a slave named Royal, owned by a citizen of Richland County, guided the militia to Joe's camp, allowing the group of fugitives to be captured and hanged for attempted murder. More than 70 citizens signed the petition asking the assembly to grant full compensation to the slave Royal for his assistance in serving the state and the citizens in the capture. The general assembly rewarded Royal's owner seven hundred dollars compensation to delegate to Royal as she saw appropriate."," The above petition provides a view into the complex racial relations in upstate South Carolina, as well as those typical across the antebellum South. The Richland district was one of largest cotton producing regions of South Carolina during this period, and was therefore one of the districts most reliant upon slave labor, resulting in a majority black population. The reality of a black majority may have resulted in a kind of reign of terror, much like other areas of the South with large slave populations. According to historian Walter Edgar, the period before this petition was issued was dotted with incidences of slave revolts across South Carolina: Columbia in 1805, Camden in 1816, and more rumors of rebellion in the coastal areas in 1822. The uneasiness of the white slave owners is clearly represented in the description of this petition and the citizens' insistence on finding the runaway slave and his camp of followers, as well as their desire to reward faithful slaves. The situation illustrated here shows the typical contrast between the wariness of Southerners with respect to threats to the system of slavery and their absolute reliance on slaves as faithful servants and members of Southern communities."],"display_date":1824,"search_date":"1824-07-01","locations":[{"id":11634,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3051,"title":"Fleeing Louisiana on a Steamboat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-01","end_date":"1862-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the middle of the night Richard, the Fearn's son, awoke his parents to tell them that New Orleans had fallen to the Yankees.

The sale consisted of all household and kitchen furniture as well as horses several negroes. All items were slated to be sold to the highest bidder. Credit was to be allowed for the purchase of some items; however the more expensive items (presumably the negroes) required the use of cash. The house of Thomas Blackwell was then to be rented for one year, with several negroes being hired out for the balance of the year. The last thing Wren mentioned in the notice is for anyone who had a claim against Blackwell's estate to come forward before the sale, so that they could be compensated after the sale for the balance that is owed."," The direct sale of slaves in Richmond during the early 1800s was frowned upon if it split up families or was deemed cruel in anyway. Richmond differed from plantation Virginia in this aspect, as in a city fewer slaves were needed and conditions were somewhat better. This specific sale is unusual because the enslaved people were being sold off due to the death of their master. Blackwell's estate was being auctioned to pay off debts that he had incurred during his life, and the slaves would bring in a substantial sum of money for this purpose.

Wilkes, also a reverend, assured Brookes that another 300 would be provided by the Marion Board and general fundraising. Brookes was very active in Baptist affairs, and also owned hundreds of slaves and at least three plantations, including one in Jones County. He wrote a pamphlet arguing that the Bible served as justification for slavery, and presumably had a previous interest in procuring a preacher for his plantations. The money raised would be enough to procure the services of John H. Clark, an ordained minister living in the field, zealous, persevering, and energetic, whom Wilkes enthusiastically endorsed as the best candidate for the plantation job.","Preaching Christianity to slaves was a problematic endeavor. Although planters wanted their slaves to be Christian and to have eternal salvation from their sins, slavery was not easily reconciled with Christian notions of equality, and many feared that their slaves would become rebellious if they heard these messages. Reverend Brookes was, however, not alone in believing that slavery and religion could be reconciled. According to many slaveholders, Christianity not only supported the institution, but also strengthened it by teaching slaves the ideals of obedience and honesty, reducing the threat of rebellion. Southern missionaries also found themselves torn between their religious beliefs and condoning this peculiar institution. Many believed that slavery was wrong and ungodly and educated slaves when they could. Methodist and Baptist ministers also comprised a significant part of the southern abolitionist movement. Others argued that emancipation was insignificant compared to the need to preach salvation, and they thought that the anti-slavery approach had to be abandoned. Their primary goal was compromised when plantation owners banned missionary activities as a result of their abolitionist efforts. ","Tensions during the Southern Baptist Convention of 1845-seven months before Wilkes' letter was written-resulted in a split between the Northern and abolitionist missionaries and those who supported slavery or were at least willing to meet slave-owners' pro-slavery demands in order to gain access to the plantations. Methodist and Presbyterian organizations experienced a similar division. One result of this schism in the Baptist Church was the creation of a board for Domestic Missions in Marion, Alabama, which is probably the 'Marion Board' mentioned by Wilkes in his letter. A prominent figure in national Baptist politics, Reverend Brookes might have been one of the pro-slavery voices during the Convention meetings, but if not, he certainly supported their view. He saw these efforts realized when Baptist organizations began bringing missionaries to his own plantations in Georgia."],"display_date":"December 26, 1845","search_date":"1845-12-26","locations":[{"id":1967,"lat":33.0230529305,"lng":-83.5603964858,"zoom":9,"place":"JONES, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3058,"title":"The Runaway Slave and His Broken Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-06-20","end_date":"1820-06-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John W. Bridges of Wilcox County, Alabama, desperately penned a letter to the Southern Recorder, the Columbian Telescope, the Carolina Observer, and the Georgia Advertiser on May 27, 1820, looking for a runaway slave by the name of Aaron. A few weeks prior to the publication of this letter, Aaron, a stout well-fed Negro man of 30 years standing around 5'10 had escaped from the John Bridges' plantation a few miles below Prairie-Bluff in eastern Alabama. The slave, further described as a little yellow and missing part of one ear, had also stolen from the plantation a long shotgun, ammunition, and twenty pounds of bacon, further upsetting his owner. Aaron's apparel remained somewhat unknown to his owner. Bridges speculated that he could have escaped wearing a dark colored homespun boater or a blue homespun coat with a black hat and a pair of shoes. Bridges continued, speculating that Aaron was headed to Carolina by Cahawba or Montgomery counties, although it is not apparent how he reached this conclusion. He ended by promising a monetary reward for returning Aaron or having him secured in jail in South Carolina or Georgia. ","Previously, the late John Jones had been his owner, but Aaron had become Bridges' slave shortly after Jones' death. Deaths of owners like Jones often led to the breakup of families at slave auctions that frequently followed the death of a slave owner. Despite the pleadings of slave families, sellers regularly sold each individual member of the family to different buyers. Although slaves left their owners for a wide variety of reasons, it is likely from Bridges' speculation on Aaron's eventual location, which he thought would be near his former plantation, that he ran away in the hopes of re-uniting with his family. The letter to the editor from Bridges also details precisely what goods Aaron took with him as he escaped the plantation. Slave owners especially feared runaway slaves that had the ability to defend themselves, so Bridges' specifically noted that Aaron took a shotgun and ammunition from the farm. The fear that slaves would rebel violently constantly loomed on the minds of slave holders across the South, proving that much of the basis of slavery rested on the monopoly on violence that slave holders held over their slaves. If slave holders lost this monopoly, they would likely lose slavery as an institution as well. ","Newspaper readers across the South would have been familiar with these types of letters and advertisements as slave holders often wrote to newspapers in the hopes of recovering their lost property. Because of the enormous economic investment that a slave represented for a slave holder, slave owners would pay large sums to those who found their runaway slaves and would often travel long distances to recover their property. Slaves at this time cost upwards of 700, so paying around 50 to travel and pay whomever found the slave was well worth it economically."],"display_date":"June 20, 1820","search_date":"1820-06-20","locations":[{"id":1522,"lat":33.0721732643,"lng":-83.2584220033,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3062,"title":"More than Just Dancing at the Ball\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-01","end_date":"1862-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Every year the Fearn plantation threw a ball in honor of the magnitude of work that had been done the year prior. The slaves put much effort into the night to make it the happiest of times. Slaves on the plantation looked forward to the ball each year. This year the ball fell on a beautiful night. The Fearns were the last to leave for the ball. As they followed the path to get there, a large slave armed with knives approached Mr. Fearn. This slave had run away three months before to avoid the harsh demands of the sugar-grinding season. The plantation owner ordered the slave to put down his weapons. Out of respect for Mr. Fearns authority the slave fell to the owner's feet and begged to go to the ball. The master agreed to allow him to attend the ball, but warned he would be subject to the punishment by the other slaves. Upon entering the ball he was severely beaten by his fellow slaves and dragged from the ball.","Oftentimes runaway slaves were not punished directly by their owners. Many owners thought that runaways were just an inevitable part of slaveholding. Although slave escapes were a common occurrence, they did not cause much excitement. In fact an owner did not advertise that he had a runaway until that slave had been missing for several weeks. This composure about runaways was due to the fact that most slaves returned to the plantation because they could not bear to leave their families. It was assumed that a successful runaway would never return to the plantation he or she left and would leave his family forever. ","Family was one of the most treasured aspects of life for slaves. The Christmas season was the best time of the year for slaves because it enabled slaves to spend time with their families. Slaves were permitted to take a break from their grueling work to enjoy the holidays. On sugar plantations throughout Louisiana this leisure period was often pushed back until the end of January - after the grinding season. It was common that a dinner and a ball were held in honor of the slaves. Dancing was the most popular activity for the slaves. They danced long into the night. Fellow slaves played music and were sometimes able to make money doing so. Masters often gave their slaves gifts during the Christmas season and may have even given them passes to go where they pleased, within a certain distance, during the rest of their break. There were obvious limitations to the festivities that the slaves were able to enjoy, but it is clear that the Christmas season at least gave enslaved people something to look forward to each year."],"display_date":"April 1862","search_date":"1862-04-15","locations":[{"id":5562,"lat":29.3204554147,"lng":-90.0865534097,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3071,"title":"New Orleans Slave Market\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-04-27","end_date":"1855-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Human beings sold as cattle was a most atrocious sight for many of the on looking slaves held in the slave markets.

Slaves trekked a long journey, sometimes states away, to New Orleans wearing shackles around their ankles and wrists. These men, women, and children were held as prisoners before and during the sales. Men and women were separated in the pens where they were subjected to physical abuse and derogatory insults. Family ties were eliminated by slaves being filed according to sex and in a descending line. In the markets, slaves were not viewed as human beings but as a possession with a price. This process of dehumanization involved white men physically examining slaves, dressing them according to the category under which they were to be sold, and being made to dance around to prove their bodies were fully capable of work. According to the book,<em> Soul by Soul</em>, during the sale period, their nights were spent in the jails, their days were spent exercising in the yard or being examined in the showrooms in the main building.","Many slave traders in New Orleans believed in making the sale quick with a large profit with little regard to the risks. Whatever slaves were not sold by late spring were sold at low prices to avoid the risks of contracting illness during the New Orleans summer. Men came from outside states to observe the depots, pens, yards, booths, and salerooms to purchase slaves.

Walsh and Fox said that for the time period, the primary establishment of slavery in Maryland remained because of the reliance on the tobacco culture in the southern region and the Eastern Shore.

The purpose of the bill was supposedly to ensure the survival of slavery in the state, but it was largely opposed. People disagreed on the real intentions of the bill, and on what the consequences of it would be. The Georgia <em>Telegraph</em> called the policy unwise, impolitic, and short-sighted. It was fraught with as much injury to the institution of slavery as if the policy had been generated in Massachusetts for the express purpose of destroying the institution. ","Both sides of the debate were pro-slavery, but could not agree on how to preserve the institution. Most argued that the bill favored the wealthy by increasing the value of the slaves they already owned, thus maintaining the planter class's status quo by making it extremely difficult for other farmers to procure slave labor at a reasonable price. Supporters of the bill believed that if the interstate slave trade continued, slaves would eventually become so numerous that they would no longer be a profitable labor source. Slaves would become less valuable as their numbers increased. Eventually, the cost of maintaining them would exceed their worth, and the practice of slaveholding would die out entirely. ","An editorial published in the <em>Telegraph</em> argued that the measure would have an exact opposite, negative effect. Prohibiting the slave trade would likely inspire other southern states to do the same, and eventually slave-selling states like Virginia would no longer have a market for their primary export. If Virginia's economy collapsed, the state would abolish slavery, and others would follow. The <em>Telegraph</em> argued, Who does not know that the accumulation of slaves, without reciprocal benefits, without profitable results, would eventuate in its abolition even in Georgia or Mississippi.

According to The Watchman, a Tennessean newspaper: the court and jury were occupied until about eleven o'clock, on Thursday night, with the examination of the case.

As everywhere in the South, violence was part of the life of people in Tennessee, especially violence between different races. But Tennessee had to deal with lots of interactions between races, perhaps more than other states, notably because Tennessee was a frontier state with many Indian lands.

That evening as the family recovered, the police arrested a black woman name Frances for the crime and planned to try her the next morning. ","Adolphus Sterne described this event in his diary on July 21, 1841. The only information Sterne gave about Frances was that she was a negro woman. This presumably meant that Frances was one of the Hyde family's household slaves, possibly a cook since she had access to their coffee. Frances's method of murder is significant as Joshua D. Rothman explains: In most cases, women were physically weaker than their owners. When they wished to harm a master or his family, arson or poisoning were more typical weapons of choice. True to Rothman's statement, Frances used poison as a way to injure her master and his family. Her physical limitations as a woman and the ease of obtaining poison and administering it made poisoning her preferred weapon. ","That their own household slave tried to murder them no doubt came as a shock to the Hyde family, and indeed upset many other white families in the area. When slaves rose up against their masters, regardless of the context in which they did so, they implicitly threatened all masters and all whites, observes Rothman. Frances's attempt set a dangerous precedent. If a slave woman could almost murder a family, what could a slave man, or worse a band of slave men do? Episodes like this created feelings of fear and distrust in the minds of slave owners. It also opened the way for other such crimes on the part of slaves. Thus the people had to act quickly on this matter. They planned to try Frances the very next day because they needed to show that they would not tolerate such undermining of a master's authority.

Adolphus Sterne went with his friends Mr. Houghson, Mr. Hoya, and Mr. Linn to Colonel Raguet's house for dinner. After dinner the Colonel accompanied the group to Mr. Moore's for a meeting of the debating society. Sterne presided over the debate and listened to each side equally. The fiery speech of wild Bill Sparks, a former Republic of Texas Congressman, would be difficult to beat. The debate was on the question of whether or not it was beneficial for Texas to be annexed into the United States. Sterne deliberated then gave the victory to the side which argued against annexation. ","Annexation of Texas into the United States was a big debate, and as early as September 1836, the majority Texans had given their support to annexation into the United States; however, as late as 1844, there were still some who thought that Texas would fare better if it remained an independent republic. One of the major concerns of opponents to annexation was war with Mexico. Since Mexican officials never recognized Texas independence as legitimate, and they disagreed on the official boundaries of Texas, annexation into the United States would certainly cause conflict. A war with Mexico would be tragic for Texas as it would be fought on their own land. Having just finished their own war with Mexico, it is understandable that some Texans would want to avoid further bloodshed. ","Pro-British sentiments also played a role in some Texans' opposition to annexation. Britain had recognized the independence of Texas and played an integral role in peace negotiations between Texas and Mexico in 1843. Some even thought that Britain could force Mexico to recognize Texas's Independence. Britain adamantly opposed annexation and was willing to do what it could to prevent annexation. The British feared the results of annexation: expansion of the United States, loss of profitable trade with Texas, and the extension of slavery. Britain was one of Texas's key allies and upsetting its people could be detrimental to Texas. Trade with the British was profitable for Texans too, and loss of that trade would hurt the struggling economy. ","The annexation of Texas was a hot issue in the 1840s because of its far-reaching consequences for several countries. Just like in the United States, there were in Texas both those who supported and those who opposed annexation. Texans who opposed annexation thought that Texas had more to gain by remaining an independent republic.

In this year, the First African Church of New Orleans, which had been officially founded in October of 1826, received two new Baptist pastors after the death of its founding pastor. These Brethren Sanders and Satterfield breathed new life into the church with their worship leadership, and membership flourished once more. In 1837, Elder Peter W. Robert returned the now-Baptist organization to its original form by renaming it the First African Church. Pastors Sanders and Satterfield were ordained in First African Church and carried on preaching the gospel. The church was held in a schoolhouse, but as the church grew, so did weekly collections and therefore finances. By the year 1842 First African had enough money and members to move out of their schoolhouse building and into their own newly constructed church on the corner of Howard and Cypress. "," New Orleans was a city more focused on making money and socializing than worrying about its collective soul. Religious services in white churches were not highly attended. These slave owners kept a lose reign on their slaves in that regard, allowing them to go to church at their own leisure. Because of this bit of freedom, blacks in the area could converge, creating their own churches and organizational hierarchies as illustrated by Elder Peter W. Robert's success. This freedom was most strikingly illustrated by the fact that the First African Church was able to construct itself a new building out of its own money. Those funds had to come from somewhere, and they were probably not being donated by white benefactors. William Craft narrated the story of him and his wife's escape from bondage and included information about earning wages even as a slave. When he asked for a few days off work, his employer granted them, but the cabinet-maker with whom [he] worked ... said that he needed [his] services very much, and wished [him] to return as soon as the time granted was up. Some slaves, then, were able to perform extra labor for their masters or other entrepreneurs and earn a bit of money to call their own. Whites tended to grant slaves days of rest on weekends. The fact that slaves were willing to donate what little they had to churches like the First African Church is a testament to the strong backing and community feel that these religious organizations provided to their members.

Mr. Conrad delivered a speech on the subject to the meeting in which he discussed the ills inflicted on the southern states by the North such as disregard for run away slave laws and their disregard for the importance of slavery in the South in general. He stated that We assure our northern brethren that the institution against which this insane war is waged, is so interwoven into our social, domestic, and industrial life, that any sudden change would be destructive to us, and even to themselves. While Mr. Conrad made it clear that the citizens of Frederick Country would not tolerate actions against slavery, he also states that secession will only worsen the situation. Mr. Conrad pleads for reconsideration by South Carolina in this statement: Hence; we do not question the power of South Carolina, in virtue of her state sovereignty to absolve her citizens from their allegiance to the federal government. But we do utterly deny her right, under the circumstances that now exist; and as parties to the compact, deeply interested in its fulfillment, we deny that she alone has the right to decide whether adequate cause exists. Mr. Conrad also presented several solutions to the conflict with the North which he suggests giving to the Virginia General Assembly. We may obstruct the wheels of the Federal Government; or defend our Constitutional rights, in arms, under the flag of the Union; and even these extreme measures would be less fatal than a voluntary secession, he stated. He and the members of the meeting agreed that South Carolina did secede the North would be quick to put them back into place and repair their own actions against slavery. The remedy is with our Northern friends: we await their action with trust and confidence that they will now see and appreciate the evil, and apply the proper correctives. "," After the secession of South Carolina the rest of the southern states were left with a very critical decision: stay in the union and allow the north to force its anti-slavery ideals upon the entire south or join the rebellion, unsure of what would come next. The question facing the upper South was not simply whether to secede but whether to aid their brothers farther south. This looming decision divided the South into three sections. The first was made up of those southerners mostly in the lower South who believed in immediate secession, the idea being the quicker secession is accomplished by the south the stronger the statement. The next group was made up of southerners in the upper South with fewer slaves who wished to wait until a group effort by all the states was decided on before seceding. The last group was made up of those who sided with the North and were against secession completely, this seeming to be the group that Mr. Conrad would side with as he confirmed by stating: We have no faith whatever in the success of any southern confederacy of these States, except merely for the temporary object of mutual defense. South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, being of the immediate secession group, all joined the rebellion with majority votes in their conventions soon after the election of President Abraham Lincoln. About the election of President Lincoln Mr. Conrad stated The election of Mr. Lincoln is recent, was unexpected, fortuitous, and if not already regretted by his supporters, will, in all probability, prove the destruction of his party. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina also joined the cause with a majority but only after President Lincoln called for a move on South Carolina, being more of the second group. In Virginia the decision on secession was especially important because Virginians were so close to the North and the South at the same time. As Edward Ayers confirmed, More than half of the war's battles were waged with in Virginia's borders, making their decision especially critical. While Virginia did decide to ultimately secede the vote was deeply divided. The slaveholders, mainly living in the east, wanted to secede while the non slave holders in the west wanted to remain in the union. This division was one of the main causes for the creation of the separate Union state of West Virginia in 1863."],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":13839,"lat":39.2038567799,"lng":-78.2606208397,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3188,"title":"Sheriff James Herndon Presents a Sale\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-04-06","end_date":"1833-04-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In April, 1833, Sheriff James Herndon of Clark County presented a sale, printed in the Southern Banner newspaper, designated to occur the following month.

His first set only contained slaves: Milley, age 22, her two children, Mary, age five, Henry, age three or four, and Charlotte, a girl fifteen years of age, apparently not within Milley's family. The second set of property included a one-acre lot within the town of Athens, and four enslaved African Americans, a carriage and harness, a wagon, a cart, one yoke of oxen, one cow and calf, four tables, and four glasses.","Placed next to wagons and cows in advertisements, enslaved African Americans took on the face of property. Charlotte had been separated from every person within her family, and her situation sadly reveals one of the tragic truths of the slave trade. Charlotte was only a single example of what happened consistently throughout the South. We are unsure as to whether Charlotte separated from her family during the interstate slave trade or, as was the case in Sheriff Herndon's sale, an intrastate slave trade. If she had been separated from her nuclear family during an interstate slave trade, then she had something in common with one out of every two slaves she met.","Throughout the South, prospective buyers analyzed the slaves intensely and traders worked vigorously to make the sale. Consistent with the thought that many Southerners did not see slaves as much other than property, Jeanette Keith claimed that auctioneers saw women with their potential as 'breeders,' and auctioneers attempted to increase the present value of a female slave by convincing a buyer that she could produce inherently stronger and more efficient offspring in the future. Buyers, such as those that would appear at Sheriff Herndon's sale, however, to ensure that they evaluated their expensive and long-term investment correctly, examined the entire bodies of naked slaves and checked for scars from whip marks. The slave market was an extremely complex experience.

However, the freed African American didn't leave the Augusta area. Instead, he waited until he could purchase and earn his path outside of the region. When Henry decided to leave, Cumming, in 1819, asked for and received the signatures of many white, male aristocrats. They all endorsed the Todd family because of Harry's good conduct, diligence, and positive community reputation. Their endorsement asked for the humanity and protection of all persons whom the family would meet on their travels to search for a place to settle. Fortunately for Henry Todd, white Southern men who met him either heeded the advice of the document or believed Todd in his explanation that he and his family was free, because he lived 40 years past the day he left August. He died at age 92.","Before the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War, masters throughout the South granted freedom to their slaves. Thousands of enslaved African Americans received the same independence as Henry Todd. In much the same way as Henry Todd, however, these newly-liberated men and women did not have many options directly after they received their freedom. They possessed no financial resources, no previous experience participating, at least as a buyer and seller, in a market economy, likely very few or no close family with which to make contacts, and no way to purchase transportation if they desired to migrate. ","Henry Todd, because of his limited opportunity as a newly-freed man, worked on the Cumming plantation until he received endorsement from the local landed gentry. Many freed slaves could only leave their plantation, or function as a free person in the South, if their former masters provided them with an endorsement or provided them with land.","Henry Todd's desire to stay with his family demonstrated the close bonds created by blacks during slavery.

Like a poison, the disease spread along the waterways throughout the state and into Mississippi; it had now reached the plantations along the Red River.","Outbreaks of yellow fever and malaria often struck the people of Louisiana. These diseases were carried by the mosquito, which bred in the plentiful standing water in the bayous of Louisiana. Cholera was different though. It was not a constant threat, and therefore more frightening. The disease was caused by a bacterium usually ingested into the body through contaminated water, although this information was unknown at the time, just as the causes of yellow fever and malaria were unknown. They did know they had a greater chance of catching these diseases near water, though they did not know the reason. Poor nutrition, insufficient hygiene, and inadequate understanding of disease and its cause led to a low survival rate. Diseases like cholera which effect the digestive tract usually cause death through dehydration. Often the cures which doctors prescribed helped cause the death of their patients rather than help them.","While both blacks and whites in equal numbers contracted the malady, the loss of slaves was incredibly detrimental to a plantation. In Butler's own parish, some ha[d] lost 10, 16, & 20 - which in some instances constituted of two thirds of their force. In Red River, Butler told to his relative, some plantations had lost as many as 80 slaves.

He owned the Staunton <em>Spectator</em> from 1856-1860. The <em>Spectator </em>reached many residents of Augusta County. He kept an extensive diary during his life, of which the years 1855-1865 are still preserved. On October 15, 1856, after having contemplated the hopeless Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and having acknowledged the local impact of national politics, Waddell thought of the assessment of his father's property, earlier that day and gave an estimate of his own possessions. Among those, he noted his printing office, stocks, bonds, two of his slaves, furniture, silverware, and a slew of other commodities, totaling to an understated 8700. His slaves Selena and Moses were mentioned in the middle of Waddell's list of property, but later on in the diary entry, Waddell alluded to a moment earlier in the day when a Dr. McGill offered 1000 for Selena. Waddell wrote that he would not have sold Selena for 20,000, unless she desired to go, or had grossly misbehaved. He continued to espouse his philosophy that, Speculating on human flesh is utterly horrible to me and he explained that he wished slavery were extinct, yet claimed to be no abolitionist and advocated that he lived in a time when emancipation was not prudent."," There was a socially accepted hypocrisy for the slaveholding Southerners. Slaveholders, like Waddell, separated the morality of slavery and the slave market. The slave market was a disgusting profit-driven business, owned by those merchants of disease and disorder slave traders. Historian Walter Johnson illuminates the contradiction that slaveholders could sell slaves as well, but believed that it was not with the intent of making a profit; there was always a noncommercial reason for selling a slave. This invisible line provided enough self-justification for slaveholders to shift the guilt of human exploitation onto those slave traders. Slaveholders were able to control and decide the actions of their slaves because they were property. The hypocrisy lies in the question, if slave traders only sold sub-human property, then why the disgust with slave traders? And if slave traders were trading people, not just property, than how could slaveholders justify owning people?

He first spoke to them then grabbed their dinner-basket. Fortunately, he let them leave and the two little boys managed to arrive at school safe and sound. Even if the Jackson Gazette wrote it was a harmless robbery, this piece of news was considered significant enough to be the first one on the page who deals with Jackson news.","Nevertheless, such events were common in the South and especially in Tennessee where there was a large number of Slaves. Indeed, West Tennessee had the greatest concentration of slaves in the state, and Middle Tennessee, especially thanks to tobacco and grain cultivation, held the largest number of slaves throughout the antebellum period. Therefore, Jackson was at the core of the slave South. In consequence, Jackson could not avoid a recurrent phenomenon in the antebellum South: lots of slaves, because of their unbearable living conditions tried to run away from their owner's plantation and dreamt about freedom. However, after their evasion, they soon realized that their standard of living would be difficult to improve. Without job, without money, and sometimes with a family to feed, they sometimes became thieves and attacked people, simply in order to survive. Moreover, the time was one of outlawry and both travel and walks on the road were extremely dangerous activities. This is partly why many historians describe the antebellum South as a very violent place and also why southerners in the nineteenth century considered African American as dangerous people and believed cohabitation with them would be impossible (and unthinkable) without slavery because if they were free, they rebel against white people.

The lifestyle that enslaved people had to endure is one that many cannot imagine today. It is not surprising therefore when slaves wished to be free of their masters and escape from plantations. The reasons for slaves running away varied but usually included fear of punishment or resentment because of punishment already administered, avoiding the harsh labor forced upon them, as well as sheer cruelty imposed by their masters. Although the great mass of Louisiana slaves remained at home, the number of runaway slaves in the state compelled the legislature to act. In an attempt to centralize the problem of runaway slaves, the Louisiana State legislature created acts in the 1820s and 1830s to set up central depots to which runaways, unclaimed for two months or longer, were to be transported. These depots kept the slaves together and used them on public works. Jailors were required to advertise the runaway slaves they kept in their prisons to successfully return them to owners. These jailors would be paid upong the death of a slave for expenses incurred with regard to the deceased.","Although Louisiana attempted to produce an efficient system to recover runaway slaves, it did not always function as intended. The legislature created several more parish depots in the late 1820s and this decentralized the effort to keep the runaway slaves in central locations such as Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Slaveholders took it upon themselves to advertise to the community the loss of a slave and incurred the expenses themselves. Plantation owners paid large sums of money to advertise slaves' looks and ages in the hope of their property being returned. One such advertisement ran in the newspaper, <em>Le Courrier de la Louisiane</em>, advertising the loss of three slaves to a subscriber. The subscriber offered a handsome reward to anyone that helped return Lewis, Isaac, and Snaiel to his fields. Judging from their descriptions, these slaves were very important slaves to their owner. Three strong young men missing from the plantation deprived the owner of not only labor bu capital and time. The January advertisement volunteered the information that one of the slaves had been missing since September, demonstrating the long time period a plantation owner could spend searching for runaway slaves. It it not certain if Lewis, Isaac, and Daniel ever returned to their owner. Runaway slaves cost their masters' time, money and a loss of control over a system that the economy of the antebellum Louisiana was based upon. The state believed that the situation of runaway slaves was grave enough to address it in their laws to gain a grasp on the problem. When this failed, the slaveholders turned to the resources of newspaper advertisements. The advertisements from newspapers in the South serve as reminders of the lengths that plantation owenrs would go to in order to insure the safe return of their chattel."],"display_date":"January 27, 1827","search_date":"1827-01-27","locations":[{"id":5659,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3239,"title":"The Foundation of Tennessee Colonization Society and the First Freed Slaves to Leave Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-12-01","end_date":"1829-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In December 1829, Josiah F.

If the slaves were not free, members of the Society met their owners and persuaded them to free their slaves and let them go to Africa.

On the second day of session, Mississippi Governor Charles Clark gave a speech on the Condition of the Country, in which he encouraged the state to stand with the Confederacy until the very end. "," An attitude of defiance marks the words of the governor as he rallied the House not to give in to any entreaties of peace or negotiation offered by the Federal Government. Clark encouraged the state to stand resilient against their foe as they fought a righteous war to preserve the Christian institution of slavery. I recommend that you solemnly and firmly declare that Mississippi will be true to her plighted faith to her sister Confederates, and will conquer or perish with them....rather than abandon our cherished and Christian institution of domestic slavery, we will send our servants with our sons to the battlefield, to fight for our right to protect and guard them against their worst enemies. "," It is the institution of slavery that so strongly strikes a chord with Clark and the citizens of the South. Economic and social circumstances of the day and age encouraged the view that the institution of slavery was perfectly acceptable and necessary for the established structure of southern society. Southerners believed slavery to be a perfectly righteous and Godly institution, in which they acted as the paternal master over their misguided slaves. It economically benefited the white man while allowing blacks to be cared for and introduced to the Gospel. The Confederacy felt it better to fight until the death rather than to allow their benevolent way of life to be stripped away from them.

There was seemingly no end to the vast land territory, there were long growing seasons, and they could grow multiple crops throughout the year. Although slavery arrived late to Texas, it soon became as powerful as an institution as elsewhere in the South. "," One example of the desire to attain slaves to work the land is evident in the slave trade offer notices that were distributed throughout the nation. Samuel Andrews created a notice on behalf of his brother living in Texas. His brother, John, was interested in having slaves sent to Texas for a few years to furnish the land. At this time, plantations and small farms were expanding rapidly throughout the state, and his brother, John, most likely saw this as a great opportunity. The slaves would work incredibly long hours from can to to can't see laboring the fields. In this case, the deal was that at the end of the promised time, the net profits would be divided on just and equitable proportions. "," Over the course of slave history, there were over 2 million slave sales in the antebellum south. The thousands of slaves that were purchased in the large New Orleans slave pens contributed greatly to the southern economy. Many buyers from throughout Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi bought slaves to tend their fields and harvest their crops.

Making his way through a swampy pine barren, Ruffin found little trace of any cultivation or civilized inhabitation. The few people in the area raised cattle and, since their animals grazed on the open land, the concept of property ownership was completely foreign to these miserable people. Ruffin scorned the crude capitalists, for some of them owned 500 to 1,000 head of cattle and not a single acre of land. In his private diary, Ruffin noted that these men belonged to a peculiar class: In about a space of 10 miles square of Williamsburg and Georgetown districts, the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, have no slaves, scarcely any other property, and almost no agricultural labor or regular industry of any kind. The men live by hunting, often helped out by petty pillage or trespass on the neighboring properties. These people, and even the more industrious and honest of the poor in lower S. Ca. are a most wretched and worthless population - compared to those whose condition that of the slaves is one not only of greatly superior comfort and happiness, but also of respectability and dignity.","Edmund Ruffin had been commissioned by James Hammond, then governor of South Carolina, to perform an agricultural and geological survey of the state. Ruffin had developed new methods of using calcerous manures to improve the fertility of soil, and some South Carolinians hoped that agricultural reform would help develop the economy and preserve the institution of slavery. Ruffin was always a renowned advocate for secession and an ardent believer in the inferiority of the black race.","Ruffin's disdain for the poor whites of South Carolina's coastal plain demonstrates the power of class in antebellum society. Notions of class were always intertwined with the institution of slavery. In his account, Ruffin immediately emphasized that these people owned no slaves, consigning themselves to a pitiful class. But as Stephanie McCurry demonstrates in <em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>, the intricate relationships of power within the yeoman household were just as significant as those more conspicuous class tensions between plantation owners and yeoman farmers. Poor white men set boundaries of power within their household that defined the roles of their wives and their laborers. The yeomen and the powerful planters of the low country were not socioeconomic equals, but they shared a position of power over their respective households, a power rooted in gendered symbols of inequality, command over dependents, and a fundamental assertion of manly independence."],"display_date":"March 31, 1843","search_date":"1843-03-31","locations":[{"id":11523,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3289,"title":"WANTED \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-31","end_date":"1875-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A wanted ad for a man named Jeff Williams appeared in The Daily Mississippi Pilot?s reward section. Williams was a convict who escaped while under lease to a family and working on the Noxubee river levee. The Governor of Mississippi offered 50 dollars for someone to arrest and take Williams to the state penitentiary. The description of the man at large was listed. Along with including his height and age, the paper made a special note that Williams was a mulatto with black hair and was pitted by smallpox. "," Most wanted ads during this time were for missing black convicts. The idea of leasing out convicts came about in the South in the years following the Civil War. Leasing convicts meant that black convicts would have to work the land of a public area or be bound to a white plantation owner who, in exchange for the labor, would pay for the convict?s fines. This idea of leasing convicts became more widespread after the war and gave ex-slave owners a new form of cheap labor to make up for the labor force they lost after the emancipation. Convict leasing also provided the states with a readily available supply of laborers to help build up the railways along with other domestic necessities. "," The high number of black convicts was largely the result of the unfair court systems in the South. Most officers, judges, and even the jurors were predominately white and showed little mercy to black offenders. Yet, most blacks tried to turn to other options to avoid dealing with the court systems of the South. The Freedman?s Bureau was a popular alternative to the unjust systems because in normal trials, blacks did not receive a fair trial. The Freedman?s Bureau was called upon by black defendants to attempt to give them a hearing to try to settle their various disputes with other blacks and, in some cases, disputes with whites. "," In addition to unfair trials, southern laws concerning blacks were also extremely harsh, making it easier to get blacks in prisons to be leased out. Arson became a capital offense, stealing from someone?s home caused the offender to go to prison for life, and the theft of livestock became grand larceny. This increase in severity in the punishments in the south gave railroad, lumber, and mining companies a great opportunity to have access to this type of free labor. The large proportion of the convicts were blacks who had been charged for relatively trivial crimes.

He notes that in the 1850's over sixteen hundred white households owned fifty-five hundred slaves within the county. With this newly gained knowledge Knoth's actions; that previously seemed rash and contingent with his insanity; now appear rational. Ayers further ascertains that slavery stood as a fundamental fact in Augusta County. In fact, its roots dug even deeper into the heart of the county when slave prices inflated dramatically in the 1850s. This inflation reassured Southerners that slaves were a good investment, and further intensified their desire to protect the institution that accounted for their prosperity from the growing threats that were prevalent in the years leading up to the Civil War.

Mary Kendall, a Northerner living with her new husband in the South, wrote to her sister to describe the feelings of loneliness. While slave-owning men were businessmen and often traveled for trade, their wives were left to run the plantations. Kendall wrote that she had recently gone three weeks without seeing another white woman. This was not the case for all Southern women. According to a census from 1810-1860 in Virginia and the Carolinas, 35% of families were made up of two parents and children, whereas 41% of families consisted of extended family as well. After marriage, Mary Jane Holladay Thompson lived with her husband, her daughter, and her uncle-in-law, whom she found insufferable.

According to Fox-Genovese, like wives of plantation owners, slave women also dealt with isolation; they were in a constant battle against the institution of slavery that bound them to a life without basic human liberties.

He harped on the morals of society and the need for government to back them up. Virtue is the only safeguard of free laws.

Overseers were also usually given a place to live and given a small garden of their own.

According to Raymond and Alice Bauer, masters saw their slaves' smiling, bowing, and scraping as evidence of their happiness, docility, and acceptance as part of an inferior race. On the other hand, slaves frustrated their masters with feigned illness and pregnancy, broken tools, and running away for short stints to avoid work. This laziness was punished through whippings and other humiliating practices. Slaves resisted day to day in these subtle ways, confusing and provoking their masters.

In addition, according to the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, most large plantations kept slave birth registers and some also maintained slave death registers as part of their property inventory listings."],"display_date":"December 1, 1839 - October 3, 1870","search_date":"1855-05-03","locations":[{"id":7099,"lat":31.7342121703,"lng":-91.0371521217,"zoom":10,"place":"JEFFERSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3330,"title":"Proposing Marriage Under Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-01-01","end_date":"1852-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Even the romantic lives of slaves fell under the authority of white masters. Slaves, being the property of their masters, couldn't just freely marry at their heart's desire. There was a standard protocol. In his biographical narrative, Allen Parker recounted how the process would likely unfold on a plantation in Chowan County, North Carolina. If a male slave wanted to marry a woman from another plantation, he first had to obtain the permission of the girl herself. Then, he would ask for consent from his own masters. If they approved, he would then travel to the girl's plantation and approach her owner. The conversation would go something like: Hello Sam Is that you? <em>Yes Massa, its me... </em>Sam, what message did your Master send by you? <em>Did'nt send no message, sar, I comed myself.</em> What You don't mean to say that you have run away Sam? <em>No sar, Massa told me as how I might come and see Massa Jones. </em>Well Sam, what is it, does your Master intend to hire you out next year and you want me to hire you? <em>No sar, Massa John don't let his niggers, he wants me hisself. But I comed to see you Massa cause I think that you yellar gal Sue is a right smart, good gal. </em>That so, Sam? <em>And I thought that perhaps, maybe, that seeing as you and Massa John was good friends, and being as I want no bad nigger at all, that maybe, possibly, you might consider to consent that me and she might be married.</em>","Then the master would investigate the slave, asking if he had any habits and checking for any visible defects. Then, he would prolong the matter: Well Sam, I like your looks, and I will think it over. You come and see me next week and I will tell you. <em>Can I see Sue, Massa? </em>Yes Sam, you can see her when she comes from the field. After spending some time with his sweetheart and waiting a week, the slave would then return to the owner: Hello Sam, you here again, what do you want this time? <em>Well Massa Jones, I comed to see as to what you thought about me and Sue getting married. </em>Get out you nigger. <em>But Massa told Sam to come. </em>How's that Sam? <em>Massa Jones told Sam to come in one week, and den Massa Jones tell Sam as how he can marry Sue or not. </em>O yes, I remember now, well Sam I have talked it over with Sue's Mistress and we have concluded to let you marry Sue, and I will have a cabin built down by the quarters and Sue can live there. <em>Thankie Massa.","</em>","African Americans strove to establish meaningful family relations under slavery. There was a strong desire for social space between slave and master, as Emily West notes in <em>Chains of Love</em>. Though slave marriages were not legally recognized under traditional white law, developing meaningful relationships that existed independent of white authority represented a means of resistance against oppression. These relationships also pointed out the gender differences among slaves, the male being expected to initiate romantic contact. Allen Parker recalled how his father would regularly walk ten miles in the middle of the night to see his wife and his family. Slave families often had to struggle to remain together as evidenced in Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Enslaved persons would often manipulate the paternalist sympathies of their owners, reminding them that filial bonds of slaves were just as powerful as those for whites."],"display_date":1852,"search_date":"1852-07-01","locations":[{"id":9345,"lat":36.285880348,"lng":-76.6866587179,"zoom":10,"place":"CHOWAN, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3341,"title":"A Trying Voyage\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-01-27","end_date":"1829-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sunday morning, January 27, 1829... a joyful thankfulness filled our hearts, for we were entering the land of promise. Mary Wightman Helm had good reason to rejoice after a most difficult journey to Texas. Helm related that the trip usually took a bearable seven days, but left without a breeze in the unpredictable Gulf of Mexico, her voyage took an astonishing 31 days. The ship only carried provisions for the expected seven days and was insufficiently stocked with water. It is no surprise that under these conditions Helm fell ill. She related, after our cooked provisions had given out, crackers and hard sea bread sustained life; but when the water gave out, then real suffering commenced. ","Helm had already survived extensive travels before she boarded the Little Zoe, the schooner that took her and her husband Elias R. Wightman to Texas. The couple departed Herkimer County, New York in 1828 and set out upon a popular route to the West. They traveled by boat down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the boarded a steamboat bound for New Orleans by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. At New Orleans, the Helms embarked upon their troubled cruise on the Little Zoe. At the time, such schooners were the primary means of travel between New Orleans and Texas because their shallow bottoms were less likely to hit the sandbars that existed along the coast of Texas. The small ships, however, were subject to the fickle weather of the Gulf of Mexico. ","Though the Helms found their voyage particularly unpleasant, it pales in comparison to the horrific passage of slaves brought from Africa to the American South. The South's economy created a great demand for slaves that fueled the trans-Atlantic slave trade even after it became illegal in America in 1808. Like Mary Helm, enslaved Africans faced hunger and sickness but also bore the added burden of generally inhumane conditions on the journey to America. Sources describe the system of transportation as gruesome and ruthlessly efficient. Such factors as malnutrition... and deprivation of sunlight from prolonged stays below deck made illness and high death rates unavoidable. And though the trade was outlawed by the United States in 1808, the illegal trade that continued through portals such as Texas brought about unprecedented horrors for captured Africans. Though most of the slaves in Texas were brought from the United States an illegal [trans-Atlantic] slave trade developed as early as 1835. The injustices that took place on slave ships occurred on the seas rather than American soil, but the blood shed on such vessels belonged on the plantations of the South. The demand for slaves created by Texas and the other Southern states led directly to the brutalities against Africans. As one source summarizes, Without the demand for slaves, there would have been no transatlantic slave trade... no illegal piracy along the coast-but, most of all, none of the terror and degradation suffered by slaves on their journey from the coast of Africa to the Americas."],"display_date":"January 27, 1829","search_date":"1829-01-27","locations":[{"id":15201,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3361,"title":"The Effects of Fertile Land in the Mississippi Delta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-01-01","end_date":"1820-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a letter received by James Ure, John Bisland, a long time friend was intent on convincing him to move to Mississippi and invest in the cotton industry because of how easy it [was] to make money here. I bought 100 acres of land which lay contiguous to my estate [and] paid 600 dollars he explained and was able to make about 500 dollars by only planting cotton on seventeen acres. Cotton was seen as an agricultural gold mine and resulted in a great hunt to search for and obtain this valuable land. ","This widespread desire for cotton created an economical boom in Mississippi which led to an increased number of settlers. After the War of 1812, a substantial number of Native Americans were removed from the area which offered fresh land at a cheep price to anyone who was interested in farming agricultural products. The geographical location of this state consequently turned Mississippi into one of the leading cotton producing areas in the nation due to the fertile soils and excellent climate needed for farming this crop. Because the soil was so deep and rich, farmers could plant cotton season after season without having to rotate fields or worry about exhausting the supply of nutrients in the dirt. This newly liberated land not only became the home for rich plantation owners who cultivated cotton on large plots of land. Poorer farmers were able to purchase property and raise row crops and tend to livestock as well as middle class folk who had dreams of someday entering the plantation society by working their way up to larger plots of land as they became more successful. ","Raising and picking cotton demand a great deal of hand labor, and the crop, typically, was worked by slave gang labor on large plantations. This overbearing stipulation resulted in a search by plantation owners to find more help on farms. Slaves were heavily sought after and cotton became one of the most influential contributors to the slave trade because of the number of people it took to harvest. By 1820 in cotton producing areas of Tennessee the number of African Americans populating this region had increased exponentially consisting of 80,107 blacks which formed 18.9 percent of the total residents. Slaves were so sought after in Mississippi that Natchez became the busiest slave market in the south after Algiers, in New Orleans. ","The town of Natchez was often times called niggerville or Forks-of-the-road because families that were brought here were quickly separated and sold off individually.

If only he could make it across the border line, Edmund would find himself a safe haven to live out the rest of his life.","Edmund was described as a 5 feet high, stout built and 26 years of age man. His extensive description included that he spoke French and English and was wearing a gray coat with dark pants. Two of his front teeth were missing and he appeared to be of a griff color. Twenty dollars was offered as a reward for his return or any information that would lead to his location. It was common for men to attempt an escape; in most cases it was easier to risk their life than to watch as their wives were taken advantage of or have no power when it came to the sale of their children.","In a study of runaway notices from local newspapers, 76 percent of all runaways were under 35 and 89 percent of them were men. The risks involved in attempting to leave the premises were ignored by many slaves because the idea of freedom was so immense. Running away menat not only sacrificing one's own life but also the well-being ot the wives and children they left behind. Often times, the families or friends of the fugitives were punished.","Runaway slaves took a huge risk in leaving their master's fields or households. Without maps or adequate directions, many relied on the North Star to guide the way to the free states. Although the runaway slaves knew at any moment they could be tracked down, the idea of no longer being owned and forced to work six days a week having every move watched outweighed the risks. Canada lay at the end of what was to be a long and dangerous journey. In some instances, a free black man impersonated a slave and led slaves off plantations to follow miles and miles of trails until they reached a designated resting station. The fugitives traveled at night by foot, train, or steam boat up North. They were aided by abolitionists involved in the Underground Railroad, which consisted of a vast network of people working together with the purpose of leading slaves to freedom. Whereas the development of the Underground Railroad allowed more slaves to reach safety, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed to prevent alleged runaway slaves from being protected or aided no matter their location. The Fugitive Slave Act was part of the Compromise of 1850 which prohibited slave-trading in the District of Colombia and admitted California as a free state.

This was reported in the <em>City Gazette</em> and <em>Commercial Daily Advertiser </em>for months. He had been a paper boy (carrier of the <em>City Gazette</em>) and was able to read and write. He was formerly enslaved in Virginia (his mother was still there) and worked for the Petersburg Intelligencer. He was known for his skill at the printing press. ","The owner believed that Tom had left Charleston by ship and perhaps had forged his own free papers. The owner thought he may have been pretending to need passage to a Camp Meeting. Camp Meetings were the religious craze of the era and were connected most with the Methodist Church. There was a camp meeting being held at a local creek, and it would have considered un-Christian to refuse passage of a black man to a religious service. Many whites justified slavery as a way to spread Christianity to people who would otherwise live without it. ","There were rewards for the return of Tom to the owner (B.S. Thomas) that increased depending on the effort involved in Tom's return. His description is given as 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a bright yellow complexion. Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free. Considering his education and connections, Tom would have been able to get away with a lot of things without being questioned. ","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822. The Negro Seaman Acts required black seamen to be locked up while not at sea, so any black man on a ship was assumed to be a run away, and to prevent the black seaman from instigating trouble among the slaves."],"display_date":"May 2, 1815","search_date":"1815-05-02","locations":[{"id":11452,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3398,"title":"Bishop&#39;s Mill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-03-11","end_date":"1820-03-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Joseph Bishop owned a mill on the Rivanna River from 1805 to the late 1820?s. He worked in the mill along with the family's two male slaves, and possibly with occasional help from his five sons. Bishop's mill supported his main economic activity, which was tanning leather. But Bishop sometimes allowed the use of his facilities to grind nearby farmers' grain, typically for free. Over the years Bishop twice had to rebuild his mill. It is possible that it was damage by one of the floods that periodically struck eastern Virginia rivers. It is also possible that the mill's wooden moving parts wore out, perhaps exhausted by the extra task of pro bono grain grinding. It is likely that on at least one of the rebuilding occasions, Bishop upgraded the technology of his mill. In 1820, after repairing his mill for the second time, Bishop ran out of generosity toward the neighbors for whom he used to grind wheat for free. He publicly announced that he would no longer grind on any terms whatsoever, and that anybody who needed grinding done should build a simple mill of their own. He may have stood by this threat for some time, but by the late 1820s he joined eleven other Albemarle gristmills in commercial production, and began selling ground corn meal in bulk. "," Historian Melvin Ely described the operation of mills and their place in the daily life of nearby Appomattox, a piedmont Virginia county similar to Albemarle in many respects. Many mills only ground wheat, though many combined that task with sawing, ginning cotton, producing textiles, or making soap. After harvest, small farmers would sell their surplus grain to the local mill. The miller would grind the grain and store it in bulk. Store-owners in towns could then buy grain to retail, or individual families could buy it as needed directly from the miller. At this time a typical barrel sold for somewhere between 4.00 and 12.00, depending on quality of the grain. According to Ely, The typical mill in the area was manned by a miller, a cooper, and perhaps a few helpers. Slaves were often employed in mills, and often became as proficient at the tasks of operation as the miller himself. Free blacks, too, often found employment in mills. "," At the beginning of the nineteenth century one of the most popular books in the United States was comprehensive guide to the science and practice of milling, written by a Delaware entrepreneur named Oliver Evans. The book's success was bolstered by the fact that Evans included descriptions of labor-saving mechanical processes he had recently invented. More important, though, was Evans's ability to relate technical information to a wide audience, in common, unpretentious language. Evans's Miller's Guide was the first of its kind, popular throughout America.

Robinson never owned any slaves. He was born in Binghamton, New York and served as a Union general during the Civil War. Despite his Northern background, Robinson objected to the passage of Special Field Order No. 15, which granted massive amounts of land to former slaves in January of 1865. On February 1, 1865 Robinson sent a letter to President Abraham Lincoln in which he argued against granting slaves the land and freedoms promised to them by the victorious Union General William Tecumseh Sherman in Special Field Order No.15. Robinson reasoned that the slaves did not have the necessary skills to function independently. As quoted from his letter, In cases where the negros planted their own land with cotton they were often too lazy to pick it when ripe, and refused to allow others to do so on the most liberal terms and the cotton rotted in the field. He viewed the land to be too agriculturally valuable to let go to waste. In <em>Rehearsal for Reconstruction</em>, Willie Lee Rose discusses a possible reason for this lack of work ethic amongst the former slaves. While enslaved, blacks received no cash reward for growing cotton. Upon being freed, they naturally focused their agricultural efforts on cultivating and sustaining crops such as corn and potatoes; harvests they knew would help them survive. Cotton served no purpose - agriculturally or economically - to the formerly enslaved. As quoted from Rehearsal for Reconstruction, The advantages of the year-long tyranny of Sea-Island cotton had not been readily apparent to the simple people who had never received a cash reward for growing it. "," Special Field Order No. 15, enacted on January 16, 1865, reserved, as quoted directly, The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. John?s River, Florida for the settlement of negroes. The order was passed by Sherman and made use of land the Union army had seized near the end of the Civil War following his destructive March to the Sea. The majority of the land included in the order had previously belonged to white plantation owners yet it was nevertheless set-aside for former slaves. Special Field Order No. 15 is commonly referred to as the 40 acres and a mule act. Robinson's final point in his letter to Lincoln was that when Congress eventually decided to sell the land, the inhabitants would be left homeless. He was not against giving African Americans land; rather, he believed that such a vast amount of land should be properly managed instead of wasted by those who had neither the skill nor the intention of using it."],"display_date":"February 1, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-01","locations":[{"id":1510,"lat":31.6956666643,"lng":-82.2948071414,"zoom":9,"place":"APPLING, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3405,"title":"The Price on a Life\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-02-26","end_date":"1849-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Daily habits, such as flipping through a newspaper, must have been hard on an anti-slavery southerner.

Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD.

The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9.

Since these children were not of the age to legally stand on their own, Murrell took it upon himself to act on their behalf. He wrestled with the choice of what to do with this inheritance, the choice made more difficult by his lack of detailed knowledge about the property since it was in Virginia and he in Louisiana."," In a letter to his brother - who was in Lynchburg and therefore in closer proximity to the property - Murrell mulled over his different options, deciding that neither cash nor bank stock was a stable enough source in which to make an investment. Another possibility was an investment in Western lands which would in my estimation be a safe one and one that would annually increase in value - but in my condition I could not leave home to attend it. Murrell recognized the benefits of actually following through with claiming such property but had reservations about not being in peak health."," Conversely he acknowledged that Negro property would be of service to him and since he - and his children - will come into ownership of that property during his lifetime, it is of that kind that [he] would like to have possession.

All across America, citizens were beginning preparations to take up life in a very different part of the country: its territories. The idea of Manifest Destiny was only a few short years away from being introduced to the American vernacular, but whispers of a God-given right to promote expansion had already begun. With this kind of moral argument coming into play, it was only a matter of time before the topic of slavery joined the discussion. Those same citizens that were packing up to move out west came from a variety of backgrounds, some of them slaveholding.

Lear administrated a large fund for the education of slaves that had been established by General Thaddeus Kosciusko, a famous Polish hero in the American Revolution. Upon Kosciusko's death in 1817, he had left the fund to his longtime acquaintance and fellow son of liberty, Thomas Jefferson. In September 1825, B.L. Lear wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of Jefferson and apparent heir to his estate, regarding a specific plan for the education of free blacks. The core of Lear's plan was to purchase young slaves and for them Education in plain literature & mechanical arts, and at a proper age transport them to the Colony in Africa to be as useful there as they may. Lear's letter also related to Randolph the following information about Jefferson's attitude toward the fund he approved very heartily the plan I then proposed to adopt, tho' he declined to give any advice or express any opinion in the matter, considering himself - now without authority."," Lear wrote this letter shortly after meeting with northern groups dedicated to the education of free blacks. The African School in New Jersey had been established in 1817 by the Presbyterian Synod of New York. New York Protestants created the school for the specific the goal of instructing blacks as preachers and teachers. Once free black people received such an education, they could be sent to Liberia or Haiti to help establish stable societies. This plan accorded with the vision of the American Colonization Society, a national initiative established in 1818, which channeled white efforts to cautiously deal with the slavery question. Whites Americans who supported plans in which education and colonization for blacks went hand in hand tended not to address a related question: If, as they believed, free blacks could become good citizens of an overseas colony through education, why could they not do so in America? Most free blacks roundly opposed colonization; they preferred to remain in the only country their family had known for generations, and work there for the freedom of black Americans still in slavery. Only about 15,000 free American blacks moved to Liberia over three decades time. Of those who did colonize, many professed a desire to spread Christianity by missionary work.","Despite the ideological support groups of white Americans sometimes afforded plans to educate blacks, and widespread backing among African Americans themselves, the support often took inadequate financial form. The African School of New Jersey ran out of money within a few years after its establishment. As it turns out, Kosciusko's fund could not be used to support it as Lear and Randolph had hoped. His family waged legal litigation for years- eventually succeeding in a Supreme Court case - to control Kosciusko's estate themselves."],"display_date":"September 1826","search_date":"1826-09-15","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3460,"title":"The Runaway Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-04-14","end_date":"1847-04-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For many enslaved people in the Deep South, slavery was the only way of life they had ever known. Regardless, stories of the North and specifically, a place referred to as Philadelphia, were incentive enough to prompt some to brave the terrifying unknown and escape the even more terrifying world in which they were already bound. At some point during the day - or perhaps it was the night - of April 9, 1847 a certain enslaved girl called Harriet disappeared from her owner's home in New Orleans. Details are not disclosed: was Harriet a slave on a large plantation or smaller home within the city? Had she just arrived? Did she have any children - or was she even old enough to bear a child? For all the mystery surrounding her departure from New Orleans, the fact remains that at least her owner was convinced that she had run away. "," A few days later, a small ad appeared in the <em>Times-Picayune</em> offering a 20 reward for this runaway. The description was still minimal, the ad offering only a few characteristics: She has a mark on her forehead, and a pleasing smile when spoken to. Information about her age or coloring was noticeably lacking, but the few brief sentences that were there did offer some insight into this woman's life. According to the owner, Harriet spoke not only English, but also French and Spanish. Her Spanish skills are rather mysterious, as there was virtually no Spanish influence in Louisiana at that point in Antebellum New Orleans. This may have been unintentional, but the fact also remains that Harriet's first listed language was French. The ad also included a stern admonition towards ship captains: they were overtly warned against harboring her."," These details hint at a life that may have been a bit out of the ordinary. The description about Harriet's disappearance, and the information that her owner chose to disclose, suggests that she may not have taken the typical escape route northward, but instead had access to escape via some waterway. The illegal nature of that was easily dismissed in light of Harriet's own defiance of the law. The slave trade was very much alive and well in the world of 1847 Louisiana, but the importation of slaves from Africa to the United States had been put to an end in 1807, after Thomas Jefferson signed a bill with that explicit purpose. Of course, this government action merely meant to some that their business operations would from then on be considered illegal. At that point, slavery had already become an integral part of the American economy, and taking legal action against the institution did not mean that it would quickly or easily fade away into oblivion. Furthermore, in that same year of 1807, plantation owners approved of legislation in their new territory of Louisiana that effectively prevented any slave from potentially becoming emancipated. Although Jefferson no longer allowed Africans to be forcefully immigrated into the United States, the current slaves already living in America at the time received no breaks."],"display_date":"April 14, 1847","search_date":"1847-04-14","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3476,"title":"From Freedom to Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-01-01","end_date":"1841-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Born and raised a freeman, Solomon Northup met a group of men in his hometown of Saratoga Springs one March day in 1841. They claimed to have heard of his propensity at the violin and requested to hire him to accompany their traveling circus performances. The pay was quite reasonable and Northup eagerly took on the job. He accompanied them the entire way down to Washington, D.C. without realizing that this was a cruel trick. Those circus performers were, in fact, slave traders looking to make a quick profit off of selling free men. "," Northup did not realize the true motives of his companions until he awoke one morning bound in chains in a damp and dark cell-like room. He never saw the traders again, but the nightmare to which they introduced him continued. From Washington, Northup was put on a ship with other enslaved people and relocated to New Orleans."," After arriving in New Orleans, Northup's outraged cries of his free status went largely ignored or resulted in angry lashings. He was placed in a slave pen along with many others. First thing next morning everyone received a bath, if necessary, a shave, and a set of cheap but clean new clothes. Northup experienced firsthand the degradation that occurred inside those slave pens; when the customers arrived, the traders paraded the slaves around and allowed them to be patted down, walked about, questioned and otherwise examined. Some of these prospective buyers demanded that the slaves open their mouths and display their teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. The dehumanization continued with mandatory exercise activities taking place. At one point Northup was even called on to provide violin music to the slaves' tortured dancing."," These New Orleans slave pens mocked any notion of innate or universal humanism. The slave traders and future owners translated their own discomfort with the practice of trading people into viewing the so-called 'items' for sale with repulsion. In their eyes, blacks existed purely for the purpose of making them, the whites, a profit. Because of this rationale, traders generally had no desire to attempt to keep many family ties together. Northup witnessed an instance of this: a buyer was prepared to purchase Emily, the daughter of his new slave Eliza, at Eliza's insistence. Before he could make the transaction, however, the trader firmly stated that she was simply not for sale. He wanted to keep her for a few more years until she matured into a more valuable slave. Up until then, Northup had lived his entire life as a free man, but in the slave pens of New Orleans he was audience to the atrocities committed against his people on a daily basis."],"display_date":1841,"search_date":"1841-07-02","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3478,"title":"Settlers and Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-02","end_date":"1830-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The steamboat made it safely over the sand bar and arrived at the mouth of the Brazos River in Texas. Upon landing, William Hunter quickly composed a letter to his business associate James Perry to give tidings of his safe arrival. Hunter noted to Perry the presence of 30 Negroes on board and wrote of his plan to inquire of the owner, a settler from Alabama, about the means of their transport into the Mexican territory that was Texas. Hunter clearly expressed interest in importing slaves to Texas, and he was not an inconsequential businessman. Perry, the recipient of his letter, was the brother-in-law of Stephen Austin, the most important player in Anglo-American settlement of Texas, and Hunter conducted business with both of these men. ","Though Hunter's life is poorly documented, much is known about his traveling companion, Stephen Austin. Austin's father, Moses Austin, originally negotiated with the Spanish government to secure a land grant and to bring 300 Anglo-American settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated northern reaches of Spain's North American possessions. Upon Moses Austin's death in 1821 (the same year that Mexico gained independence), the grant passed to Stephen Austin. The specific attention given by Hunter (and presumably shared by Austin) to the importation of slaves into Texas is of great interest due to its place in a primarily business-related letter and the early date at which it occurs. It appears that like other parts of the American South, slavery in Texas was associated with business and profit, regardless of slaveholders' professions of paternalistic sentiment toward enslaved people. Also, the fact that slaves were brought into Texas at such an early stage in Anglo-American settlement is important as it affected later national politics. ","The Mexican government, in fact, frowned upon the form of slavery found in the United States. All slaves in Mexico were legally emancipated in 1829, however Austin's powerful friends managed to secure an exemption from this law for Texas. In composing the Civil and Criminal Regulations that governed his colony, the laws regarding slavery were the only ones imported directly from codes in the American South. Such Anglo-American support of slavery at the highest levels demonstrates both the pervasive nature of the institution and the reason that it eventually became such an issue of contention. In the years before Texas joined the United States, the annexation debate was influenced by Texas's possible status as a slaveholding state. Reminiscent of the conditions that necessitated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Northern residents and anti-slavery forces were concerned with the balance of power shared by slaveholding and non-slaveholding states. In 1844 Democrat James K. Polk ran on a platform of annexing Texas and re-occupying Oregon, a bid to please both North and South. Thus, Hunter's seemingly innocuous comment regarding slaves being brought into Texas was actually a portent of turbulence to come."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3483,"title":"Staunton Convention of 1816: The Tyranny of Eastern Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-08-19","end_date":"1816-08-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["RESOLVED that this meeting will now proceed to elect two fit persons to meet delegates from other counties in this commonwealth at Staunton on the 19th of August next, for the purpose of concerting... judicious means of reforming the representation of the state legislatures,  stated the resolution of an Augusta County, Virginia citizens meeting. For the county seat, Staunton, state politics became local in the August of 1816, when a statewide convention was held in the town to, according to the Columbian of New York, amend or propose amendments to the [state] constitution. The delegates came specifically to debate questions of representation in the state legislation. As more settlers crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle in the Shenandoah Valley, they agitated for more representation in the House of Delegates-still dominated by lowlanders from the Eastern tidewater region."," Representatives from twenty-four of the western counties and 12 of the eastern counties came to Staunton on August 19. By the end of the convention five days later, the convention had drafted a memorial to be presented to the General Assembly. Noting that despite having less than half of the total population, the 49 counties in the southern and eastern parts of the state had a majority in the legislature, the memorial exclaimed that in a republican government the will of the government should be the law of the land and yet in a state boasting of the pure republican institutions, this first and fundamental principle of republicanism does not exist.

Dick Howard in his article for the Virginia Law Review, 'For the Common Benefit': Constitutional History in Virginia as a Casebook for the Modern Constitution-maker sees the Augusta Convention of 1816 as a part of a larger sectional conflict between the eastern and western parts of the state. Waves of migration during the eighteenth century, into Shenandoah Valley counties like Augusta, and subsequent prosperity and population boom resulted in political tension between the two parts of the state. These stresses were further exacerbated by economic slumps in the east and a general unwillingness among Tidewater residents to relinquish the power they had held in state politics since the state's creation, as reflected in the appearance of only 12 eastern counties at the Convention. The matter would not be settled until a convention was held in 1828 to reform the constitution."],"display_date":"August 19, 1816 - August 24, 1816","search_date":"1816-08-21","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3486,"title":"Abolitionist Expelled from Bethany College\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-10-12","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was the fall of 1855; Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia had been in session for only a few weeks when an incident shattered the equanimity of the student population. Five northern students were dismissed for trying to introduce their Abolitionism into the college, into its literary societies, and into the church, according to the college president and founder, famed Restoration minister Alexander Campbell. On October 12th the A.L. Institute, a college literary society, was holding a debate on the topic of The Right of Christians to Engage in War when a student, Mr. Everest of Ohio, remarked that 'the arguments from the Bible to sustain war, polygamy, and slavery belong in the same category.' The following Sunday night, another young student from Ohio, Mr. Way, again pressed the issue when speaking of Satan's misquoting and misapplying the scriptures when he tempted our Savior - he remarked that 'Satan's emissaries often misquote and misapply Scripture to sustain intemperance, spiritualism, and slavery.' On this night, the challenge was not ignored by the southern students present but called forth many threats and expressions of indignation. These two students, along with three of their classmates, were promptly expelled.","Little is known of what happened to these young abolitionists, though there is evidence that they returned north and told their story to several newspapers in the upper Midwest. But it is the use of Biblical scripture to argue against slavery that stands out in this narrative. The radical Christian reform movement was reaching its zenith around the 1850s with the rise of the religious abolitionist movement, as well as the temperance and pacifist movements.","Highlighted in the student's arguments, however, is one of the tensions inherent in antebellum religious reasoning against slavery. The Christian anti-slavery movement faced a difficult problem in refuting the southern slaveholder's claims that a literal interpretation of the Bible supported slavery. Thus, the question for the abolitionists became how to repudiate slavery in the Bible without refuting all scripture. Everest and Way addressed this problem by linking the Bible's support of slavery to its support of other practices widely acknowledged as socially unacceptable, like polygamy. They also linked slavery to the other major reform movements of the time by mentioning intemperance and war. But their argument also raises the issue of where to draw the line on literal biblical interpretation. This issue became a theological quagmire for many Christian abolitionists at the time, difficult to escape, and one that limited effective use of the Bible in the argument against the South's peculiar institution.","This story is indicative of the high tensions and conflicts that prevailed among all levels of American society at this time, North and South, abolitionist and slave-owner, theologian and educator, especially over the issue of slavery. The Bible would soon be interpreted in a very different way, as both the North and the South would use passages to support their separate causes in the Civil War.

The sugar plantations contributed to the American economy and although they were not always the wealthiest of ventures, the proved to be objects of mystique to travelers passing through southern Louisiana.","One such visitor to Louisiana was William Gray Fairfax of Virginia. Gray was on his way to Texas with a company of men when they stopped near Donaldsonville, Louisiana. While stopped, Madame Toureau of a nearby plantation, showed Gray then inside of her sugar house. The idea of a plantation was nothing new for Gray but he remarked on several things he saw while visiting the sugar plantation. He commented on the slaves, saying, the Negroes could only speak French; this points to the French settlement of the area. Although the plantation in Gray's eyes had the appearance of wealth he wrote further on that the figures he collected on the profit of the industry were a small yield for the apparent size and force. This shows that despite the work put into the crop, sugar cane was not always the most profitable crop in Louisiana.","Sugar plantation, like the one Gray visited, grew out of the vicinity of New Orleans in the period 1742-1795. This originated with French Creole planters that lived in the area. At this time, farmers focused on indigo and tobacco which provided a plantation foundation for the growing industry. In the next two decades, the sugar cane industry expanded in all directions while early frosts, poor soil, and the intrusion of the profitable cotton industry confined sugar cane production to southern Louisiana. The new technological advances in production tools, such as the boiling apparatus, propelled sugar cane's expansion and rooted it in the economy of Louisiana by the second decade of the nineteenth century. ","In order to glean a profit from the sugar business, the partners needed a large amount of labor. The slaves of the plantation supplied the manpower in the fields and in the mills. During the harvest slaves worked even longer hours...[and] raced against the weather to collect the harvest before the first frost and attacks by insects. This was backbreaking work and during the act of processing the crop, it was not unusual for several slaves to be injured by the rollers as they fed stalks into the mill or tried to untangle stalks from flywheels.","Although Gray was only a passerby in the plantation world of Louisiana, his eyes were opened to a larger part of the United States economy. By seeing a working sugar plantation, Gray saw a fixture of Louisiana agriculture and financial system. In his mind cotton planting must be more profitable, and he could not register the need for a large amount of laborers when the profit was small.

A remaining 82 was due to them later on account. Other slaves were also rented out. W. Russell paid out a sizable 70 for Pompey's labor, while Joseph Sharry doled out a mere 10 for Flora's services.

Alongside wheat and shares of bank stock, his estate bought and sold people in the account books. Lewis's family let Sally keep her child and newborn baby when they sold the three for 17. The newborn baby brought in 5 alone. On the other hand, due to her poor eyesight, Caroline's buyer and seller considered her worth nothing more than the cost of her food and clothes. To the Lewis family, Caroline was an 'investment', and her disability meant that they would receive a poor return. "," Lewis's estate guardians knew they had to pay the bills and they chose to pay off expenses with people. In 1834 and 1835, his family was able to cover their debts by hiring out or selling enslaved people to others. Black families had to suffer for the white family to maintain its comfortable way of life. To soothe their patriarchal consciences, Lewis's family made a point in his accounts to note how they kept mothers and children together when they sold them. Lewis's story was not atypical. Upon his death, guardians had probably taken control of his estate and hired out or sold enslaved people to keep his dependents in comfort. The rising popularity of hiring out enslaved people signaled an economic shift in the South. As some basic industry entered into southern communities, it became more profitable to rent out a portion of the enslaved population to work in the primitive factories that sprouted up in the mixed agricultural economy rather than keeping them on the farms. Slave labor was cheaper than free labor, so it appealed to factory owners as well. "," Some of Lewis's enslaved people might also have been eventually sold further South from Virginia. With land better suited to produce for the booming cotton market than the tobacco-oriented Upper South, the Deep South's demand for forced labor increased even as its northern neighbors' supply of unnecessary labor rose. Deep South demand meeting Upper South supply ensured a forced southern migration of enslaved people. Sophisticated slave trading firms in big southern cities like Norfolk or Richmond used urban slave markets to oblige the economy by sending down enslaved black people from further North to New Orleans and elsewhere. Slave dealers sold the vast majority of enslaved people in direct bargaining processes with potential buyers in the slave pens. Rapid sales in massive public auctions did not occur as frequently.

A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation. This rivalry was still a factor in many parts of the South, even in the 1850s, especially in the less settled regions. Many parts of western Virginia were still wilderness at this time, and so this story would hold particular relevance for those in the less settled parts of the state."],"display_date":"June 26, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-26","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3507,"title":"Augusta County, Nat Turner, and Abolition","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1831, the news of Nat Turner's rebellion provoked a seemingly unexpected response from women in Augusta County, Virginia: a call for abolition. While the women called their actions unexampled, and they felt all the timidity incident to our sex in entering the sphere of politics, they worried that the revolt was but a partial execution of a widely projected scheme of carnage. They could not hide the fears which agitate our bosoms, and the dangers which await us, as revealed by recent tragical deeds. Apparently the women believed that the slaves, once emancipated, would have little incentive to revolt. Further, the women were ready to take on the lost labor themselves.  Tell us not of the labors & hardships we shall endure when our bondservants shall be removed from us. They have no terrors for us, the petition continued."," The <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the county, would later publish additional information on what is perhaps the same push for local women for emancipation. The <em>Annals</em> relate how, in 1831 John McCue, one of the State Delegates from Augusta, presented a memorial to the State Legislature signed by 215 Augusta women praying for emancipation. While emancipation was not granted, the Women were not alone. The Annals report that there were numerous other petitions from Augusta County as well."," Although contrary to the conventional view that slavery in the South was immutable, the women's' petition probably did not fall on deaf ears in the Virginia Legislature. Historian Scot French notes that the State Legislative session of 1831 and 1832 following Nat Turner's Rebellion, became a debate over the future of slavery, the specter of black insurgency, and the possibility of solving this problem through abolition and removal of African Americans from the state. French quotes James McDowell, from Augusta's neighboring county, Rockbridge, as commenting on the large number of black victims killed in a frenzied white response to the revolt: Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his deluded and drunken handful of followers which produced or could produce such effects? Was it this that induced distant counties where the very name of Southampton was strange to arm and equip for struggle? No, sir, it was the suspicion eternally attached to the slave himself, the suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family. It was as if Nat Turner had in one vicious stroke exposed the violence at the very heart of the slave system, to the point that more than a few in Augusta County and Virginia wanted to abstain."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":13636,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3508,"title":"A Contraband Works for the Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-14","end_date":"1862-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The contraband only spent a short time working for James D. Templeton's brigade before his death, but in that time the ex-slave managed to leave a lasting impression. Templeton was a young Union soldier from Savannah, Ohio who took part in several major battles of the Civil War, including Antietam. He spent much of his first two years in the mountains of West Virginia, as the horn player in a military band attached to Rutherford B. Hayes' 23rd Ohio Infantry. On April 14, 1862, he wrote home to his parents to describe a former slave, or contraband, who came in about a week ago and began to work for the brigade. Templeton described the man as a very pleasant fellow and works well. Says he will stay with us and go with us home. Two weeks later, his parents received another letter mentioning the escapee, this time to relay the facts of his death. You remember I told you we had a contraband at work for us? He took sick and died very suddenly on Tuesday last. We did all we could for him. He was only sick two days. The doctor pronounced his disease inflammation of the stomach. He was a fine fellow and we miss him very much. ","As slaves fled from their former owners during the chaos of war, they often attached themselves to the advancing Union army. Though some slaves attempted to make the dangerous journey to the states of the Union, the advancing northern army was often the closest and safest option. Everywhere the northerners went, escaped slaves followed, usually to be held by the advancing army as contraband from the enemy. The Virginia-West Virginia border provided a perfect opportunity for many other slaves to escape, as West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863 on the condition it would be a free state with a plan of gradual emancipation for those currently enslaved. Since the state shared a long border with the largest slaveholding state in the Confederacy, Virginia, it was a popular escape route for many slaves. ","As Templeton's letter indicates, the new contraband went to work for the soldiers of the Union brigade. All over the South, contrabands worked for the northern army in many different roles, as laborers, hospital workers, cooks, and often body servants for federal officers. They became a vital part of the workings of the Union army. Slaves were even put to work for the Confederate cause, usually pressed into building trenches or fortifications, and thousands went into the field with their masters as personal servants. By the end of the war, Jefferson Davis was even pressing for the conscription of slaves into the Confederate army, with promises of freedom for those who volunteered. Though this Southern plan was never put into action, the North did indeed recruit and arm runaway slaves, as well as free blacks from the northern states. In this capacity, many African Americans served with honor and distinction.

While this would be of note in itself, of special interest is that in his will, according to the <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, General Blackburn liberated his forty slaves on the condition that they would immigrate to Liberia. Their trip was paid by his estate. No mention is made if the slaves reached Liberia, or if his wife, who survived him by five years, liberated the enslaved peoples immediately following his death. The <em>Annals </em>do stress his evangelical Christianity, including an excerpt of his will in which General Blackburn writes,  I die, as I trust, a Christian, believing as I must in the doctrine for the atonement by the death, the suffering and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ..."," General Blackburn was not alone in Augusta County in his desire to send enslaved peoples to Africa. In December of 1831, a petition with the signatures of 28 Augusta men was sent to the Virginia Legislature asking for their support of United States Constitutional amendment which would give the United States Congress the ability to raise and appropriate money to transport free persons of color to the coast of Africa, and also, the power to purchase slaves then transport them likewise."," A belief in slavery was anything but static in the white South. Rather, opinions on thepeculiar institution varied widely. Melvin Ely's <em>Israel on the Appamattox</em>, recounts how slaves from Prince Edward County, Virginia, are set free, given land, and co-exist relatively peacefully with their white neighbors for over forty years. Yet Ely also notes that Blackburn's response, Colonization, was not uncommon among whites with qualms about slavery, although informal surveys taken just after Nat Turner's revolt seemed to show that much of Virginia's enslaved black population had little desire to move from their birthplace to Africa.

It also indicated that those men who had previously been designated for light duty, should report to training camps, or be immediately sent to the front. ","Virginia had experienced some of the worst ravages of the Civil War by late 1864, and almost 75% of its eligible male population had joined the Confederate Army. But the desperate straits the Confederate government found itself in by this late date forced the implementation of drastic measures. In this case, all men formerly on detail who had been assigned specific tasks behind the lines, as well as those on furlough (granted leave by their superiors) were immediately called back into service. The calling up of those who had been given light duty is another indication of the manpower problems the South was facing in the waning days of the Civil War. Light duty was usually assigned to those who had been previously injured or otherwise declared unfit for active service. The Confederacy had only about six more months of existence by October of 1864, but the government was doing everything it could possibly do to survive.","By 1864, however, a quarter to a third of the soldiers east of the Mississippi River were conscripts. The conscripts were despised by volunteer soldiers, and were considered less reliable on the battlefield and more likely to desert. But conscription laws had been in place in the Confederacy since 1863, when an order was issued for all eligible men between the ages of 18 and 35 to join the army. By 1865, the minimum age of recruits had been lowered to 17, while the maximum age was extended to 50. At this point, the government of the Confederacy was even considering allowing slaves to fight for the South in return for their freedom. The measure was actually passed in March of 1865, but the war was over before any slaves could actually be put into the battlefield.","Though conscripts did make up a significant minority of the Confederate Army at the end of the war, the loyalty of most Southerners never waned. In fact, in many cases the more hopeless victory appeared, the more patriotic many Virginians came.

According to the<em> Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the County, it all had started when Maria, one of Dr. McChesney's enslaved children, came to dinner one night very much frightened, apparently having been chased by an old woman with her head tied up. Soon after, stones began to fall on the McChesney's roof in intervals-both at night and day. The <em>Annals</em> record that the stones averaged about the size of a man's fist, and some of them were too large to be thrown by a person of ordinary strength. Occasionally, some of the stones were hot, and scorched the dry grass on which they fell."," The McChesney's tried sending Maria to their in-laws, the Steeles. The situation was no better there. As Maria approached, the white family found themselves with all the furniture in their large room piled up promiscuously. Sods of dirt began to rain down on their house. Soon, Maria began to complain of being beaten with slaps that the Steele's could hear but could do nothing about. Maria would eventually fall down exhausted and the beatings would stop. As the Annals recount, worn out with these troubles, Dr. McChesney, as a last resort, sold Maria, and she was taken South. As soon as she left the disturbances ceased and they never followed her in her new home. ","   Questions of the supernatural aside, a certain paternalism towards his slave permeates Dr. McChesney's behavior-paternalism that Walter Johnson describes at length in his history of the Slave Market, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Much of this ideology implied that the owner knows what is best for his slaves, a fantasy readily seen in the way the slave owner's decision to send the child down South is also her cure.

On a Saturday night in late October 1832, Joseph Wienand, the manager of the Neptune Hotel in Charleston, was murdered. Apparently, he was in possession of between 200 and 300 in cash. His murder was discovered by his African-American female servant at close to 6 a.m. the next day. After repeatedly rapping on his door to awaken him to start the day, the servant became nervous and forced her way into his room. He was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Upon investigation by a coroner, it was declared that he was murdered by strangulation with a handkerchief and by blows to his head with a stone. It was a sad fate for Mr. Wienand, a good member of Charleston society. ","Like any other city, murder and crime were facets of life in Charleston; however, it was not a huge problem for the antebellum city. In fact, the problems of regulating crime were more centered on slaves and free blacks rather than whites. Whether a white person or a black person killed Mr. Wienand is not known. However, it was quite apparent that as time wore on, white members of Charleston society who committed crimes were subjected to more lenient punishments than their black counterparts. In fact, city leaders became so worried about slaves and free African Americans committing crimes that the Charleston Work House was established in 1839. That year, the Work House became a house of correction for slaves. In addition to becoming a place for the punishment of slaves who committed various offenses or crimes, the Work House was also established so that the city would have a central place for a slave market. The work house was run under Spartan conditions and in a correctional manner. Many considered it a deterrent to committing crimes. No one wanted to go to the Work House. In addition, it was designed in a Gothic Revival style, similar to that of many churches built after the Great Fire of 1838, serving as a reminder that the righteous did not commit crimes like that one that was so cruelly bestowed on Mr. Wienand. ","Judging from the murder of Charleston hotel manager Joseph Wienand, one would assume Charleston was unsafe. However, as Maurie McInnis points out in a chapter of her book, <em>The Politics of Taste in Antebellum Charleston</em>, crime was greatly controlled in Charleston during the 1830s and 1840s, thanks in large part to fear of being incarcerated in the Work House.

Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3529,"title":"Slave Sale Comes in Many Forms\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-05-20","end_date":"1836-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["ohn Stapleton, an English attorney, handled the affairs of several Charleston properties included in the estate of Mrs. Hannah Bull. He managed the sale of her slaves, cattle, hogs, sheep and other effects of Mrs. Bull's properties after her death. In a letter to Higham, Fife & Co. dated May 20, 1836, Stapleton detailed the sale of several slaves and included the titles. As the attorney, the money realized from the purchases was received through Bills of Exchange.","In 1836, the sale of slaves was increasing as the need for their labor moved farther and farther south. South Carolina was at an economic standstill; at the time of this letter, Charleston was about as anti-entrepreneurial as it could become. South Carolina's rice culture was in decline, and cotton farms were appearing all over the Deep South. Therefore, many slaves found themselves sold to outlying plantations and other states at a very fast rate. According to Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em> it was necessary for South Carolinians to obtain legal assistance when attempting to sell their slaves, just as Mrs. Bull did. In addition, Mr. Stapleton sold her slaves by private bargaining rather than in a huge slave market. Although popular image dictates slaves were sold in large venues, often there was a lot of behind-the-scenes private bargaining that took place, as it did with this sale. Johnson notes that even though much of the slave trade remained rural and personal like this sale, there were increasing opportunities during this time for trade in large, urban centers, such as New Orleans, Louisiana. ","Selling her slaves through her lawyer may have been one of the least cruel ways Mrs. Bull knew to convey them. Allowing her estate to be liquidated rather than sold through an attorney would have almost guaranteed cruel treatment in slave market, as seen in Johnson's book.

Presumably a bachelor, Taylor realized soon after making his purchase how enjoyable it was to have a female to make his house into a home. To Taylor, having a woman to cook his meals and clean house was the best gift slavery could offer. ","However, soon after his arrival in the South, Taylor was inundated with of anti-slavery propaganda from Northern abolitionists. Concluding that the actions of these abolitionists had the potential to cause separation of the Union, he was of the belief that abolitionists should pay attention to their own affairs. Many Southerners like Taylor believed that slavery was not the cruel institution portrayed by Northern abolitionist. In an 1837 letter to Jeremiah Wilbur, a friend from New York, he recounted the tale of a minister from the North who met a wealthy slave-owning woman from the South. Up until that point, the minister had made it known that he was against slavery and for abolition. However, the minister and the woman fell in love, and the minister began to change his previous thinking. He began to rant against Northern abolitionists and Northerners in general. Ironically, he had once been an abolitionist himself.","Abolitionism was a great concern for many in Charleston. Like Taylor, prominent members of Charleston society feared that if slavery was abolished, hired labor would come to resemble hired labor in the North- a cruel, cautionary tale against capitalism. Abolitionists were only causing distress in Southern cities like Charleston. ","Taylor's views on slavery and abolitionism echoed those of many Southerners, especially those who resented being inundated with propaganda. Abolitionists accused slaveholders of many cruelties, including forced reproduction and childbearing of female slaves, and not allowing slaves to practice religion, just to name a few. According to historian Ira Berlin, abolitionists experienced difficulty proving many of these accusations, but the mere appearance of those caused uproar in the South and planted the seeds of disunion, as seen in Taylor's letter. E.W. Taylor exemplified Southerners for whom abolitionist propaganda from perceived hypocrites raised the spectre of disunion. Yet, many Northern abolitionists were, in fact, free blacks who were drawing on their own experiences in captivity for information for said abolitionist propaganda."],"display_date":"January 25, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-25","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3531,"title":"The Great Fire of Charleston and its Cultural Awakening\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-04-27","end_date":"1838-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27, 1838, an enormous fire broke out in Charleston, South Carolina, around 9:00 pm. It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings. It ruined many businesses, a new hotel, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Many houses were burnt to the ground. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used. In addition, several people died in the flames. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. The total monetary loss amounted to about 3,000,000, a sum even more significant in nineteenth century Charleston than today. ","A newspaper article mentioned that several slaves died in the fire, but declined to name them, unlike the many white victims who were named. This reflected the social hierarchy. A long obituary was even given for Colonel Charles John Steedman, a Naval Officer stationed in Charleston, on account of his exemplary citizenship both before and during the fire. Additionally, several prominent store owners are listed as having died attempting to save their stores. Ironically, the fire did not cause Charleston's demise. Rather, it caused a great cultural awakening as many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired. ","The Great Fire of 1838 had a far-reaching impact on the city of Charleston. In many ways, it helped to put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Although previous to the fire only a few homes were styled in the Greek Revival, many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion. This may have also represented an effort to portray the slaveholders who were attending these churches are benevolent, Christian men and women. Gothic was not used for state buildings, however, as James Patrick confirms in his article Ecclesiological Gothic in the Antebellum South. In addition to being used for religious buildings in Charleston, the use of the Gothic, according to Patrick, reflected an attempt to portray Southern locales such as Charleston in the most romantic light possible. Southerners were fighting to keep their culture alive, especially in state like South Carolina, where there was constantly talk of nullification and states rights after the Nullification Crisis. All in all, the art and architecture of Charleston had great implications for a city rebuilt after a horrific fire."],"display_date":"April 27, 1838","search_date":"1838-04-27","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3532,"title":"Charleston Women Discuss Support of States Rights\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-07","end_date":"1833-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women like Laura Margaret Cole Smith of South Carolina were not blind to the implications of politics for the Union as a whole. Upon receiving news of the 1832 Nullification Crisis, Laura wrote to her cousin Camille explaining her opinions on the state of the Union. Smith held steadfastly to her belief in South Carolina's states rights. Although the prospect of war saddened her because her father and brothers would have to fight, she believed that it was important for South Carolina to preserve its liberty instead of conceding to the Union. South Carolina was discussing war and succession far before states like Virginia.","The Nullification Crisis was not the first time that the slavery/anti-slavery debate had threatened American political stability. In signing the Tariff Act of 1832, President Andrew Jackson pushed a previous tariff struggle that had been brewing between South Carolina and the federal government to a climax. Tariffs previously established in 1828 had been deemed by South Carolinians unconstitutional because they taxed imported goods, which were popular in the states, more heavily than those made in the North. In the view of many South Carolina planters, the North was being favored by this tariff, and the economic problems of the Carolina rice culture were being ignored. In addition, they saw themselves as unnecessarily persecuted because South Carolina was a slave state. Jackson signed a new Tariff Act in 1832 that lowered the tax somewhat; however, South Carolinians had hoped he would do away with the law all together. In November 1832, the South Carolina assembly came together in a special session to declare the tariffs null and void in South Carolina. It became a struggle of states rights versus federal rights, now known as the Nullification Crisis. ","Letters like Smith's of January 1833 also show that Southern women before the Civil War were required to be involved enough in political affairs to be able to support their husband's or father's political opinions. Their opinions were usually congruent with that of the male members of the families. Sally G. McMillen confirms that women were expected to have the same views as the men in their families in her article Women in the Old South. Interestingly, in Harry L. Watson's long description of the Nullification Crisis in his book Liberty and Power, he does not even allude to women being involved in the political front at all, because, quite frankly, they were not. Although women could discuss politics and support the opinions of their families' males, they did not have a say in politics and were not allowed to vote, showing that women were expected to fulfill the traditional female role of family caregiver. Laura addressed her father and brother in the beginning of the letter; they were absent from the home, and she wished for their return, showing how much she cared for them. Speculation leads us to the conclusion that they were dealing with the nullification crisis in a political context. In addition, she commented that she had discussed the issue of nullification in private with the gentlemen in her life; they were grateful for her support."],"display_date":"January 7, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-07","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3533,"title":"Massachusetts Judge Driven from South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-11-01","end_date":"1844-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The people of Charleston were not above standing up for what they believed in, even at the expense appearing rude and overzealous. Judge Samuel Hoar of Concord, Massachusetts, and his daughter, Elizabeth, traveled to Charleston in November of 1844. Their intentions were not known when the trip was announced; however, soon after they arrived, it became clear that the Massachusetts judge had come to Charleston to assist the state of Massachusetts' citizens in dealing with South Carolina law. Free black sailors from the Northern state were attempting to load cotton onto Massachusetts' ships. However, those were soon impounded, and the captains were forced to pay a ransom or the African Americans on board would be sold into slavery. South Carolinians did not feel that Massachusetts had any business meddling in their affairs. In a resolution passed by the South Carolina state legislature, they called Judge Hoar an emissary of foreign government, even though South Carolina was still part of the Union at this time. In addition, the resolution declared that even free blacks are not citizens of the United States under the Constitution. It also called for Judge Hoar's immediate expulsion from the city. ","It was rumored that Hoar and his daughter left the city on account of actual mob violence. However, the apparent truth was that they left the city after being asked to leave to avoid violence. Although Hoar was not backing down on the issue, he was also not attempting to have physical harm done to him by what seemed to him as some unsavory Charlestonians. ","At the heart of this issue are South Carolina's unwavering commitment to slavery and its loyalty to secessionism. Additionally, Hoar's experience was perhaps all a misconception and misunderstanding, as many Northern visits to the South were. However, by the time of the 1840s, even free blacks who resided in Charleston were in a precarious situation. Many were not legally emancipated, but had found ways to circumvent the law. Although they were often respected as contributing members of the economic totem pole, they had to tread carefully in order not to make the white elite of the city angry. For the Charleston free blacks, their freedom was only determined by how kind the white members of society felt, since they were not actually free. This is supported by Bernard Powers in his book <em>Black Charlestonians</em>. While he acknowledges the great accomplishments of free blacks in antebellum Charleston, evidence greatly supports that their successes were always at the hands of the elite lawmaking white. No wonder outsider free blacks who had no personal ties to the city were taken hostage. In addition to the fact that they were not legally emancipated, by 1850, free blacks were competing with an immigrant population for jobs. Their whole life situation was always at the hands of others. Unfortunately, this particular incident involving Jude Hoar ended quite badly and was eventually a detrimental blow to South Carolina's willingness to stay in the Union."],"display_date":"November 1844","search_date":"1844-11-15","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3534,"title":"A Remarkable Case of Slave Manumission\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-03-14","end_date":"1844-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Slavery was not a permanent institution for some Southerners. In 1838, Dr. Brisbane, a Charleston, South Carolina resident, sold his twenty-seven slaves in order to move to Cincinnati, Ohio. While in Cincinnati, he decided that he did not want his former slaves to be subjected to bondage any longer. Brisbane returned to Charleston in 1844. Searching for and finding the twenty-seven enslaved African Americans, he bought them back at a cost of 6000 more than what he had received for their sale. He and newly reacquired slaves departed for Baltimore, Maryland; subsequently, they traveled to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. From there they set out for Cincinnati. Intending to give them their freedom and a head start in their new lives, Brisbane then purchased a tract of land in Hamilton County, Ohio where the formerly enslaved could settle comfortably. ","Did Dr. Brisbane free his former slaves because some of them were his children? Did he free them because he was affected by those around him after he moved to Cincinnati, a locale less in favor of slavery? Neither answer is known. We can, however, speculate that either of these was perhaps the case. Joshua Rothman notes in Notorious in the Neighborhood that, when white men in Virginia freed their slaves, it possibly signified an intimate, sexual relationship with their mother.

From the idea that African Americans were a lesser race who needed taking care of by white patriarchs to the economic justification, slave owners were always trying to find new ways to dispute those who disagreed with their choice to hold others in captivity. Charleston slave holders were no exception in attempting to find justifications to mask their guilt. Often, religion came into play, on both the slavery and anti-slavery sides of the debate. In 1835, at the end of two long articles about religion and slavery in the Charleston Mercury, it was said that both the Old and New Testament give permission to hold others as slaves. In the Old Testament, God and the Patriarchs approve. As for the New Testament, Jesus and the Apostles show that slavery is permissible. Therefore, slavery, to those who wrote the article, was not an anti-Christian institution. It was just the opposite. Furthermore, they added, it is impious to say slavery is anti-Christian because such a conclusion contradicted God. ","Such extremist beliefs were common in the slavery/antislavery debate. Slaveholders believed that slavery would liberate Africans from their savage-like ways, especially if they were infused with Christianity. As religion ran deep through slavery, white Christian slaveholders argued that slavery was a necessary evil because it would control the sinful, less humane, black race. ","Slave owners, beginning in the 1830s, began to permit black religious gatherings in some forms. In addition, Charleston slaves and free blacks were allowed to attend church with their owners. However, previous slave revolts like Virginia's Nat Turner caused worry that religion would make slaves think they had the right to be free. Turner experienced religious visions that caused him to believe that revolt was divinely ordained. Slaves allowed by their masters to worship were closely monitored thereafter.","Even though the article in <em>The</em> <em>Charleston Mercury</em> claimed that Jesus supported slavery, the Biblical truth is, according to J. Albert Harrill, that Jesus was remarkably silent on the slavery issue. He never outright named it explicitly as a sin. Both sides of the slavery/anti-slavery debate used this ambiguity to their advantage, embellishing the details that supported their case. The slaveholding South stretched the truth and claimed that Jesus permitted slavery. The anti-slavery North claimed that Jesus never said sodomy, blasphemy, and idolatry were sins, even though to Christians, they clearly are. The word of the Lord, to them, did not have to spell out what was right and wrong. Overall, both sides of the debate used religion to their advantage, stretching the truth wherever necessary to help their cause, just as in this article from <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>."],"display_date":"September 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3546,"title":"A Pennsylvania Court Convicts Under the Fugitive Slave Law\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-08-08","end_date":"1851-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the news of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 reached Holly Springs, Mississippi, the citizens were very anxious to see how the North would uphold the laws.  The law stated that if one captures a fugitive slave, it is the responsibility of the law enforcement and citizens to aide in the returning of those slaves to their rightful owners.  The people of Mississippi knew that slaves would attempt to escape, and hoped that these new laws would help them keep the property in which they had invested so much.  The court's decision coming out of West Chester, Pennsylvania was a great sign of success for the South, as well as the institution of slavery.","The article in The Palladium, which was a Democratic newspaper, stated In an almostincredible short space of time she was delivered to the claimant, or his agent, who put her into a close wagon and drove rapidly from the State.

This shows a lot about the cares and interests of the people of Mississippi at the time of the Fugitive Slave Laws.

Lastly, a black, Jane Green, who was with Anderson on the night of the shooting, recalled talk of a black soldier being beaten up in the street outside, to which Anderson responded saying, he could whip any rebel man who had hit a Union man. She then said that Anderson was met by gunshots from Mankin, who she said may have been wearing a black coat and hat. The doctor who then examined Anderson's wound said its position was the result of the bullet coming from an elevation.

M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3604,"title":"The Love and Marriage of Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L.

Hubard wrote approximately twenty letters to each other on topics ranging from the health of their respective families to the passion they shared for each other. Randolph lived in Buckingham County, Virginia and made occasional visits to White Sulphur Springs (now a city in West Virginia) while Hubard, who was originally from the same area, wrote his letters from several different locations around Virginia, including Richmond. Presumably, Hubard's recent commission as a colonel of the Virginia militia in 1858 required him to travel frequently for prolonged periods. During this period, militias sprung up all across central Virginia in response to the call for war. In addition to Hubard and Randolph's correspondence, James' little brother Robert T. Hubard also weighed in on the young couple's nuptials, adding his perspective, insight, and advice on starting life together in central Virginia as well as his dealings with African American slaves.","In his first letters to Randolph, Hubard expressed his concern for the health of his future mother-in-law; apparently, she suffered from some sort of ailment that required treatment in the city of White Sulphur Springs. Eventually, Randolph wrote that her mother had gotten better but complained of lovesickness within her own breast, imploring Hubard to break away from his work and visit as soon as possible. The two clearly cared extraordinarily deeply for one another; with each sighing request from Isaetta, James responded with his own assuaging remarks intended to reassure her of his unyielding love, expressed his regret that he could not come visit, and enumerated the many times throughout his daily activities that his mind wandered to her. The couple's excitement builds noticeably throughout the last few weeks of their correspondence, both writing repeatedly about how much they miss the other and, somewhat peculiarly, how their families long to be united through their impending marriage. In a separate letter, Robert T. Hubard wrote about the sickness of his wife Phyllis and that of several of his black slaves; because the slaves were exposed to a mysterious contagion, Robert decided to have Charity [and] her family moved to the house 200 yds west of Sam's house, as [he] did not like to have sick negroes so near [his] dwelling home. ","The relationship between Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L. Hubard was fraught with the difficulties often faced by southern couples during the antebellum period of the nineteenth century. Hubard, a recently commissioned colonel, was separated from Randolph but managed to save their relationship through his persistent writing. Moreover, the desire of the two affluent families to unite with one another represents a common desire of wealthy southerners to prolong their legacy through intermarriage. Their family's wealth, and to some degree benign nature, is exemplified in Robert's letter regarding his sick slaves. A nuanced reading of Robert's distancing of the slaves from his house reveals a form of racial suspicion regarding sick negroes; it seems as if he was more fearful of what was ailing them due their race than the because of the actual sickness itself. At the same time however, the slaves lived in family units, a condition that must tragically be considered a luxury considering the frequency with which children were separated fromtheir parents and husbands were stripped of their wives in the business of slavery."],"display_date":"August 8, 1860 - November 15, 1860","search_date":"1860-09-26","locations":[{"id":13691,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3605,"title":"Commencement at Howard Draws an Illustrious Crowd\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-05-01","end_date":"1879-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It wasn't every day after the Civil War that former slaves and former slave-owners would admit to having something in common, much less celebrate it openly. But in the early summer of 1879 at the commencement exercises for Howard University, they did just that. The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites. Historian Michael Dennis explains that white Southerners realized the necessity of educating the newly emancipated African-American population in order for them to be able to sustain themselves; however, most were only in support of their education if it was separate from that of the white population."],"display_date":"May 1, 1879 - May 30, 1879","search_date":"1879-05-15","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3608,"title":"Bettie V.

The movement was a period of intense religious activism that trickled down from northern, urban cities and affected Protestant denominations with a heightened sense of social activism. Bettie V. Jones, a resident of Fluvanna County, Virginia, received numerous letters from family and friends, including her husband, William J. Payne, and various other people from and around Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the letters, the Payne family was prominent in the political sphere of central Virginia; included in the letters is a mention of the 1852 Whig convention and the upcoming election, along with a seating chart for the House of Delegates for the 1853-54 session. Jones, a Methodist herself, corresponded with a few Albemarle County residents about the Charlottesville Methodist Church revival, an event that was probably similar to the countless other religious awakenings sweeping the nation that sought to, among other things, counter the assertion that the Bible was fallible. ","Of particular interest to the historian in the collection is a letter addressed to Jones from a family member in Arkansas, a slave state admitted in 1836 on the condition that Michigan was admitted in 1837 as a free state. The issue of runaway slaves is addressed in the letter, a contentious subject that caused a great deal of strife among slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike. The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850, was established in response to the demands from the South for more stringent and detailed Federal legislation concerning the rights of slaveholders and the punishment of runaway slaves. This controversial law further divided those for and against slavery, prompting the increase in the number of abolitionists and the inception and increased efficiency of the Underground Railroad. ","The central tension that is elucidated in the letters to Bettie V. Jones is that of the revivalist spirit and increased moral awareness of southern Americans coupled with the institution of slavery. The collective conscience of the American South was at a crossroads in the 1850s; on one hand, the comfortably profitable lifestyle many southerners had grown accustomed to depended on slave labor as the backbone of their economic system while, conversely, the Third Great Awakening signified a renewal of vigor and strength in relation to the importance of personal religion. In 1845, some slaveholding states left the official Methodist Church to form their own branch, one that condoned slavery on the basis of moral justification by invoking God's will and the examples of slavery in the Bible. The Third Great Awakening focused on the intertwining of religion in the public and private sphere, a relationship that forced both community leaders and citizens to evaluate their beliefs in order to steer clear of hypocrisy. Bettie V. Jones, along with the other central Virginians who experienced the awakening, grappled with the inherent moral and social contradictions presented by religion and slavery that created an unsolvable dilemma, one that only a schism could reconcile."],"display_date":"1849 - 1856","search_date":"1852-12-31","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3618,"title":"Jacob Enders Buries a Slave Child\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1845 Jacob Enders, an undertaker employed by Dr. Marcus B. Buck of Fluvanna County, Virginia, constructed a coffin, dug a grave, and buried an African American child for the total fee of two dollars and seventy-five cents. This receipt of service is included in a collection of other receipts and letters; a doctor's bill from one John Thomson, dated December 29, 1840 and a letter from Buck's wife are among the most notable documents that exist from around the same time period of the slave's burial. In the letter from Elizabeth P. Buck, she tells the unknown addressee that her husband is quite and that she wants him to go over the ridge, or into the valley. Nineteenth-medicine had very few remedies for the many ailments of central Virginian farmers, and these sicknesses were often transferred from among members of a family living in close quarters as well to and slaves that may have worked on the plantation.","Jacob Enders' notation of the services he rendered for Buck is nondescript and exceedingly simple. The transaction is divided into two parts, enumerated in column form with the description of his action on the left and the price associated with each deed. First, Enders lists Making coffin for Negro child and the figure of one dollar and twenty-five cents; next, Digging grave and interring same is listed as costing one dollar and fifty cents. The coffin was probably made of simple wooden planks and the burial sight was most likely unadorned, perhaps marked by an inauspicious headstone or cross. The life of this particular slave child exists in the mere three lines of Jacob Enders' receipt.","No matter how historians may characterize certain slave owners as benevolent masters who took good care of their slaves, life on a central Virginian plantation for a field slave was brutal. Summers in Fluvanna County were at times unbearably hot and humid, and the close living quarters available to slaves of middle-class farmers were undoubtedly hotbeds for sickness and disease. The fact that Jacob Enders' receipt is apparently scattered amongst other records from Buck's family and friends, including various other doctors' bills and general correspondence from his wife, suggests the insignificance of the young slave's life. Unlike Robert Campbell, a barber in nearby Augusta County whose life was remembered fondly and was actually memorialized in an obituary, this particular slave child was buried anonymously and ignobly. Though human life was expensive on an economic scale, the only record of Buck memorializing or reflecting on the death of this particular human being is captured in a simple document of sale. The inconsequential regard for African American life and the poor living conditions of meager, slaveholding farmers are demonstrated in this incident."],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3621,"title":"Race and Medical Care\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-11-18","end_date":"1831-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 18, 1831 Dr. Stirling Ford paid a visit to the slave of Mrs. Evans. In his journal, Dr. Ford gives an account of the slave woman's condition and treatment prescribed for her blister to the neck and open bowels [and] debility headache. Although it might seem normal that a doctor would treat an ailing person, not all nineteenth century physicians were willing to take on African Americans, free or enslaved, as patients. Dr. Ford, on the other hand, was known for giving free smallpox vaccines to his patients, both white and colored. Some southern states went as far as requiring masters to provide for proper maintenance of their slaves, this care was mainly achieved through the care of ailing slaves by their master or mistress. Following the 1808 abolition of the international slave trade, the health of slaves became a matter of greater importance to slave owners. Thus, many slave owners paid more attention to seeing that the basic dietary needs of their slaves were met. "," Again, Dr. Stirling Ford was one of the unique physicians willing to treat blacks. In his journal, Dr. Ford delineated all of his patients by various codes according to class, gender, and race. He referred to patients the black patients he served as man, woman, and child. Never in Dr. Ford's records did he use the word slave; instead he referred to enslaved peoples as servant. Though many of his contemporaries did not treat blacks, Dr. Ford was a kindly man, who took his duties as a physician seriously and served all in need of his services. On several occasions, Dr. Ford recorded visiting large plantations, noting that he visited the family, both white and colored. His reference to the black community living on the plantation as the family is an unusual term of endearment reflecting the affectionate concern held by the responsible class of slave owners for the well-being or the slaves that they owned and possibly Dr. Ford's personal views regarding slavery."," Though the law insured some level of healthcare for enslaved people, as aforementioned, many doctors refused to render their medical services to black patients. This attitude can be attributed to the popular belief in the inferiority of black people. This belief in the inferiority of blacks was used not only as a justification for slavery but received a good amount of ill researched of scientific support.

Throughout the south there were periodic crackdowns on free blacks, with officials demanding identification papers and jailing those without proper documents.

Davy's companions told his captors that Davy was more than likely attempting to reach a free state.

The slave trade tore apart many enslaved families. Mothers would be separated from their babies, fathers were sold away from their families, and children were sold away from their parents.

Furthermore, the fact that Davy ran away with the accompaniment of another captive was not unusual either.

Luckily, one of the slaves leaked the information to the servant of one of the passengers who informed her master of the plot. To take precautions against the possible uprising, the slaves were put in irons for the remainder of the voyage.

"," An interesting point drawn from the letter was the slaves' intention to sail to St. Domingo following a successful takeover of the vessel. St. Domingo, or modern day Haiti, was a sort of utopia in the minds of American slaves.

The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one.

Riddick of Nansemond County due to the death of the named executor, Thomas Swepson. Mr. Riddick's will called for the disposal of his estate for the payment of his debts. However, Riddick stipulated that in order to raise the deficiency [the Executor was] fully authorized and requested to mortgage the lands and to hire out the slaves for the purpose. For the next eight years, Mr. Prentis hired out Riddick's slaves to neighboring farmers in order to pay off the debts of the deceased. At the time of his death, Robert Riddick owned eighteen slaves. This number, while not huge, was quite substantial and suggested a sizable agricultural operation. Although, when one looks at Mr. Prentis' description of the slaves and the value he placed on each, one can see that perhaps the number alone can be a bit misleading. ","Of the eighteen slaves Mr. Prentis listed in his account book on December 31, 1819, only six were adult males. Furthermore, of those six only two were considered valued over 300 and one of those, Tom Bray valued at 350, was well past his prime at forty-eight years of age. However, Armistead was valued at 500 because he was only eighteen years of age and presumably had a whole lifetime of labor in front of him. The only other male slave close to the value of Tom Bray and Armistead was a man named Jacob, described by Prentis as a small and weakly fellow forty two years old. The other three men were worthless or close to it. Dempsey, valued at 100, was approaching at fifty-five years old. The remaining two, Mingo and Jimmy, both were appraised at 0. Mingo was around seventy years old and very diseased having lost one eye and nearly blind in the other while Jimmy was about sixty years of age and listed as very decrepit. The twelve other slaves that constituted Robert Riddick's property were all adult females and their small children. Of these there were three adult women appraised at 300 or higher. These three were all between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-nine years old, prime childbearing ages."," Further reading into the account book of Mr. Prentis reveals that he was able to hire out Mr. Riddick's slaves to pay off the late man's debts, as directed in the will. Naturally, the amount received for each slave hired out makes sense when compared to their values listed earlier. In the year 1820, old Jimmy was hired out for only five dollars. The small and weak Jacob fetched 32.50 while fifty-five year-old Dempsey earned thirty dollars. Although much younger than Tom Bray, Armistead was hired out for 34 while Tom was hired for 55. Though one cannot be sure, this was probably due to the fact that the older Tom had some skill that was in demand by his temporary master."," The story of Robert Riddick, his slaves, and the posthumous management of his estate was a common one in the slave-holding South. Southern slaveholders, while wealthy in land and human property, did not have a lot of capital at their disposal and frequently purchased on credit which often plunged them into debt. The death of a slaveholder required that those debts be settled, and often that was accomplished through the hiring out of slaves to raise the money necessary to pay the creditors. This process was time-consuming but it allowed the late slaveholder's family to retain ownership of the slaves that a quick settlement of the estate (i.e. the auction of the slaves) would not accomplish. The amount of time it took to pay off the debts of a deceased slaveholder through the hiring of his slave property could vary greatly depending upon the size of his debts and the sex, age, and physical condition of his slaves. For example, the job of settling Riddick's debts may have taken less time if half of his slaves had been young, healthy males like Armistead. Richard Randolph a Prince Edward County slaveholder discussed in Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, owned a great number of slaves that were to be manumitted upon his death.

The ad, which was actually more of an announcement, concerned the need for equipment, tools, food, and other supplies by the colonists whom the Society sponsored. These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3668,"title":"Northern Neck of Virginia Desires Immigrants\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Board of Immigration from the counties of Richmond, Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland assembled to compose their forthcoming pamphlet enticing immigrants to their regions of Virginia: ...our earnest desire is to attract to it and immigration not only from the northern and north-western states, but also from Canada and Europe.

In addition, Emma mentioned that Cyrus, Sarah's husband, behaved similarly, or at least acted in such a way as to earn whippings from the master.

Some particularly resentful slave women ignored their chores and openly defied their owners. The fact that Sarah was not whipped in the above case, however, does not reflect a rule. Female slaves could be whipped, and mistresses could and did whip their slaves.

All African American congregations were subject to some form of surveillance.","Bishop Clark's awe at the worship style of the churchgoers was a common experience for whites. Even whites who attended mixed churches remarked on the differences, the most obvious being the exuberant clapping and dancing through which Blacks celebrated their connection to God, a connection which would one day deliver them from the bonds of slavery.

All of a sudden he heard a noise high above him in the sky. The boy looked up and saw two enormous birds swooping and stabbing at each other. They began to get closer and closer to the ground until they completely fell out of the sky and landed right beside him. In complete shock, Pompey did not move a muscle but continued to stare at the birds next to him. Their talons seemed to be wedged in each others flesh. Then, the birds took off into the sky. A couple of minutes later, they again fell to the ground beside Pompey with their talons still wedged in each others bodies. The boy began to approach the wild birds, and without hesitation threw himself on top of them. After struggling with them for some time, Pompey managed to snap the necks of both birds and successfully killed them. He then proceeded to carry them to Mr. Cragwall who quickly identified the birds as Bald Eagles ","This story of Pompey and the two Bald Eagles, published in the Richmond Whig, illustrates a very important idea and concern not just among southerners but among all citizens of the United States. The writer of this story, H.R.P. saw the incident as a direct representation of the current struggle between the two Unions: The battle in the air, is the strife destined to take place between the two great sections of the Union. Pompey represented his own ebony race, slipping in upon us while engaged in mortal combat, and wringing the necks of both. H.R.P. was also very shocked at how many people drew the same conclusion from this series of events. His story illustrates the fact that many people could have predicted the Civil War that would take place almost thirty years ahead this time period. ","Alexis de Tocqueville expressed the same prediction as he said, I shall refuse to believe in the curation of a government that is called upon to hold together forty different nations. They would not be able to avoid ideas of ambition and rivalry, and therefore would eventually have to split. In <em>The Impending Crisis</em>, David Potter states that Tocqueville's prediction was based, fundamentally on a recognition of the disruptive and intractable nature of slavery. When Pompey and the African American race intervened in the already heated struggle between the two Unions, they raised the issue of slavery, complicated the situation tremendously, and drove both sides to the brink of war. Pompey's story shocked many people in Virginia and gave people insight into the crisis that lay ahead.

Northern leaders had degraded you and themselves, he criticized, by inviting the co-operation of the black race with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Confederacy and inviting them into the North's army and navy. Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

They wrote to him, saying that they were currently residing in Toronto. Their letter did not include, however, stories of happiness and joy in the free world. Instead, the slaves told Mr. Lake of their overwhelming desire to come back home to his plantation. They expressed their regret for leaving him, and wished that they had never run away in the first place.

He asked that if the slaves were seen returning to his plantation they not be harmed or maltreated in any way. "," Mr. Lake's advertisement is very important because it shows a certain aspect of runaways that we do not readily think about. Many fugitive slaves, if they did make it to the North, had no place to go, and no means to live. On the plantation, they were bound to the land, yes, but they were also given housing, clothing, food, and a means to survive. In Slavery in the Cities, Richard Wade states that Free Negroes in the cities [lacked] the money required for medical care, and, had the highest mortality rates of any urban group. Many struggled to find jobs and a place to live while free in the North and were still being treated as inferiors. Wade illustrate this when he notes that the street railway kept separate cars for blacks and that theaters provided special galleries for colored persons. Just because the blacks were free didn't mean whites in the North treated them as an equal. ","The fact that Rueben and Noah Brooks wished to return to a life of bondage in central Virginia demonstrates that they had enjoyed much better living conditions back in Fauquier County.

But there were characteristics that Norton and Steele dramatically emphasized to gain interest in the slaves they wanted to sell. They offered young boys and girls who were desirable, because they are smart and 'copper coloured' and also posses other skills like being good nurses. Choosing to find a willing buyer through the newspaper, they were hoping to find one who needed house servants or young workers in the field. No prices were given for their worth, indicating that a price could later be negotiated. The demand for enslaved persons determined their worth. ","The lack of human dignity in the slave trade was confirmed through advertisements such as this. The cold description of slaves for sale is disturbing because the worth of the individuals centered on how well could he/she serve a new master. The historian Walter Johnson, in his book Soul by Soul, argues that selling children was common and done without concern about breaking up families. This narrative supports with Johnon's portrayal of the slave trade; it was inhuman and even included children without regard to how that may affect families. ","Moreover, the adjectives used are equally revealing as to the attitudes taken by slave owners. When trying to sell slaves, no bad adjectives were used but rather adjectives that make a slave seem to be more valuable. To many people who traded, slaves were just another account entry. In order to determine appropriate prices, however, categories were established by traders who had knowledge of what a slave might be worth. Even paradoxically, slaves were treated well prior to being sold in order to fatten them up and make them seem to be healthier; a healthier slave earned more in return. The appaling treatment of people in the slave trade cannot be overstated."],"display_date":"April 12, 1850","search_date":"1850-04-12","locations":[{"id":11628,"lat":34.811393256,"lng":-82.9187403935,"zoom":9,"place":"PICKENS, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3700,"title":"Twelve Years a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-02","end_date":"1853-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The memoirs of Solomon Northup vividly portrayed the descent of a former New York freedman into the harsh system of slavery faced by many African Americans living in the antebellum South. Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3767,"title":"Lincoln The Monster\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-02-07","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On January 7, 1863, the Lynchburg Daily Virginian posted an article that called President Lincoln a monster.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3829,"title":"Stolen Away: Slave Children\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-04-12","end_date":"1841-04-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            Beverly Randolph of Powhatan, Virginia carefully planned her last will and testament to divide equally her assets amongst her children. In the late 1830s, Mrs. Randolph divided ownership of several plantations and a considerable number of slaves in her will. The bulk of her slaves went to her son Charles, but Beverly spent extra time dividing slave children to her other designated heirs, noting, \"to my daughter Lavinice I also give a girl called Caroline and a boy called Richard, the former the child of Maria and the latter a child of Fanny...\" This casual reference of forcibly removing children from their families reflects the fragile position of slaves, especially children, in the plantation South.","            While some planters gave the impression that they cared for their slaves and did their best not to separate families (especially children and their mothers), in most cases, simple economics won out over good intent.

The division of slave families was also a regular occurrence when an owner died and passed his or her slaves down to their heirs or designated slaves to be sold in order to pay off debts. As in Beverly Randolph's case, children were completely separated from both of their parents in order to equalize her daughter's inheritance with no regard for the personal welfare of the slave mother or child. This unique vulnerability of slave children lent itself as one dark aspect of slavery, the destruction of a child's family despite the supposedly well-intentioned owners.

Owned by a wealthy family in Kentucky who sent him to Virginia for a brief period of time, Watts awaited the opportunity to return home with his son for over a year.  During his time in Campbell County, he \"lost\" his wife and daughter as well as most of his financial viability.  Unable to afford the price of the journey back to Kentucky, Watts wrote to Brown to ask for more money.  He expressed concern about the dissolution of his family, mentioning the state of a fellow slave mourning the sale of his son to another plantation owner.  Yet Watts also made use of his time away: he visited friends of the Brown family, fulfilled his slave duties, and also tried to find a new wife.  Family played an important role in the lives of slaves, but slaveholders could easily break a family apart.","            In the 1830s South, slavery was an institution valued as a source of economic wealth and production.  When it became financially advantageous to sell a slave, or when a slave became an economic burden for his or her owner, the majority of slaveholders had few reservations for selling their slave to someone else.  Historian Wilma A. Dunaway notes that despite a strong emphasis on the family as an emotional and physical support in plantation culture, masters \"devalued the human characteristics of their slaves\" in order to justify breaking up slave families.  While it is unclear how Watts lost his wife and daughter, the urgency he expressed at the thought of losing his son reflects his fear of existing without a family.  ","            Yet Watts also knew of the potential danger in saying too much to his mistress.   As John Blassingame writes, slaves often held back much of their emotion from their masters for fear that their masters would take advantage of or chastise them.  Throughout his letter, Watts flattered his slave-owning family and made them aware that he fulfilled their orders while in Virginia.  The fact that he reserved a place in his letter to ask that his family remain together highlights the immense importance of kinship and the ease with which it could be shattered.  Watts' gender also played a major role in the probability of separation from his son.  Mothers rather than fathers were more likely to remain with their young children because it increased the chance of their children's survival.  Thus, despite his distance from Kentucky and his possession of a small amount of money, Watts knew that he was still at the mercy of his masters.

Morehead from Guilford County, North Carolina presented the petition to the Senate. The Senate received the petition a few days before its adjournment.  The Western Carolinian Newspaper reported the petition to the general public on January 17, 1839.  The journalist from the Western Carolinian did not write positively about the abolition attempt, and was shocked that the movement was happening \"at home.\" ","    A petition to Congress about slavery was very common at this time.  Congress was force to issue a gag rule to end the constant debate about anti-slavery petitions.  The major issue however, was that the Quakers pushed this petition from a very prominent slave owning state. Quakers were very vocal about their religious beliefs against slavery, which sometimes got them into a lot of trouble. The Quakers strongly upheld the idea that all men are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers also felt the need to obey the law and be moral citizens.  However, these two conflicting beliefs did not stop the Quakers' fight. Many Quakers, such as Nathan Mendenhall, were active in the manumission society.  This was a society that Mendenhall and his fellow Quakers created in attempt to set up new areas in Liberia for freed slaves to live.  Other Quakers owned \"freed slaves\" to keep them from being resold into slavery, worked directly with the Underground Railroad, and were active in court cases dealing with possession of slaves. Due to this obvious protest of slavery, Quakers faced many conflicts with their slave-owning neighbors.    Quakers received harsh treatment and persecution for their actions as well.  These problems caused many Quakers to flee to the new frontier.  The majority of the Quaker population ignored their neighbors' resistance and continued to fight slavery from within North Carolina.  Although the North Carolina Quakers were a peaceful and moral religious group, they still played an important role in the abolition movement from their location in a slave holding state.

After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

Of all the slave rebellions in the United   States, this revolt led by Nat Turner was perhaps the most infamous. Turner's violent rebellion capitalized on one of the plantation class's greatest fears: insurrection. Campbell, in his letter to Colonel Baldwin, detailed the revolt's aftermath, noting \"the whites murdered amounted to fifty-eight\" and that \"excitement and apprehension\" had consumed Virginia. Over the course of two days, approximately seventy slaves, including \"eleven of Richard Drummond's Negroes,\" terrorized the white citizens of Southampton County. In order to comprehend the significance of the Southampton slave insurrection, it is necessary to first understand the brooding concerns of the Southern planter class.","A slave rebellion, argues historian Marion Kilson, \"expresses the realization of the worst fears of the slavocracy.\" Due to plantations' significant dependence on slave labor, an Eastern Virginian county comprised of a larger slave than white population was not atypical. The Historical Census Browser shows that according to 1830 census figures, the population of Southampton County contained 7,756 slaves and 6,573 whites. Because slaves were regarded by the white minority as a form of chattel property that could be bought and sold, potential for uprising was-ever present. Whenever violent rebellion did emerge, Southern sentiment punished the entire slave population in hopes of re-establishing confidence in the traditional plantation economy.","As a direct result of the Southampton slave insurrection, the Virginia General Assembly instituted strict legislation further assuring white social control over free and enslaved blacks. Historian Scot French writes that the Assembly \"banned blacks from preaching or attending unsupervised religious gatherings,\" while Harvey Wish notes that the Assembly strengthened the \"police codes of the slave state[s].\" Wish further observes the fact that because Nat Turner was an educated black, \"Negro education became more than ever an object of suspicion.\" Panic regarding future conspiracies encouraged trials and convictions of many slaves for alleged plots that never materialized. As William Campbell observed, \"in the present state of excitement, a little [suspicion]... on our side goes a long way.\""],"display_date":"August 22, 1831 - September 4, 1831","search_date":"1831-08-28","locations":[{"id":14281,"lat":36.7198931687,"lng":-77.1037749414,"zoom":9,"place":"SOUTHAMPTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3900,"title":"Southern Wartime Humor Concerning President Lincoln\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-07","end_date":"1863-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1863 the Raleigh Register published a song by Smith Webb mocking President Lincoln and his ability to keep the Union together.

Another verse of the song urged Lincoln to think more carefully in the future.  Webb used the song to hopefully end the war when he stated, \"Lay aside all this love of the Niggers, And stop all this pulling of triggers, Send home your gunboats sir, Wherever one floats, sir.\"  ","    Wartime humor was present in both the Confederacy and the Union during the Civil War.  The newspapers printed humor in different forms including drawings, songs, and poems.  The humorous propaganda was very political and commonly associated with a certain party relating to both local and national events. The humor appealed to all classes and united them during their time of struggle. Many of the humorous writings focused on patriotism. Often the writings urged citizens to fight in the war or support their nation and the war effort with more enthusiasm.  Humor was also used as an outlet to express discontent with the war and the political situations occurring during the time. ","The Confederate newspapers constantly published wartime humor mocking Lincoln and portraying him in extreme fashions.  Lincoln was the embodiment of the South's anger with the war and the current state of affairs.  His trouble with secession was a constant subject of mockery from the southern newspapers.  One cartoon depicted Lincoln as an acrobat balancing the North on one side of his pole while dropping the South to the floor below.  Another cartoon depicted Lincoln as a circus performer about to do a balancing act with the northern and the southern states as plates on sticks balancing in the air.  Lincoln was subject of a variety of wartime humor published in the South, but all the humor published served to communicate the current political issues and opinions.

At that convention James Shannon gave an address entitled \"Domestic Slavery,\" in which he attempted to justify the practice of slavery and disprove the validity of the reasons given by abolitionists to outlaw the practice. The reasons he gave in support of slavery covered a broad spectrum, typical of the Southern justification of slavery. He cited Bible verses that in his mind showed that slavery was condoned, even encouraged, by God himself. He predicted economic catastrophe in not only the southern United   States, but the entire country, if the slaves received freedom. Shannon estimated the value of slaves in the United States at over two billion dollars, a huge financial loss in the event of emancipation. He attempted to refute claims about the immorality of slavery by arguing that the slaves actually benefited from American slavery, saying that under the guidance of the white race the Africans learned how to be civilized. In his conclusion he suggested that once \"all peaceable means to protect our rights, and save the Union\" were exhausted, \"we will stand to arms,\" and \"God will defend the right.\"","            Shannon's arguments for slavery were typical of the rhetoric used by pro-slavery forces in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Southerners believed that they were justified by the law and by God in their practice of slavery, but Shannon's remarks went beyond simply justifying the practice of slavery. Even in 1855, half a decade before the first state seceded from the Union, the idea of secession from the Union was common among Southern pro-slavery forces. The aggressiveness of the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed outlawing slavery in all the land acquired during the Mexican-American War, caught the attention of Southerners. Shannon was among many others who thought that preemptive action was necessary to stop Northern politicians from outlawing slavery. This early support by Southerners for secession and acceptance of violence as a necessary step in order to protect the right to slavery made the American Civil War seem inevitable, even five years before the first shot was fired."],"display_date":"July 13, 1855","search_date":"1855-07-13","locations":[{"id":7668,"lat":39.0656247172,"lng":-93.7855117112,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3930,"title":"Student Withdraws After Beating Slave Girl\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-03","end_date":"1856-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            In May 1856, students and faculty at the University of Virginia were consumed by the news that the faculty board forced a student to withdraw after beating a slave child.  The removal of a student from the Academical  Village over a slave whipping was difficult for many to believe since whipping was a common disciplinary action for misbehaving servants.  Confusion mixed with curiosity lingered throughout the grounds.  ","            In late April 1856, W.D. Clarke, a student at the University of Virginia became particularly agitated after seeing a young slave girl chase a flock of pigeons onto the grounds of the University of Virginia.  After chastising and threatening the girl with a whipping, Clarke approached the slave's master to inform him of the child's misconduct, expecting prompt disciplinary action.  To his astonishment, the master chose to disregard the girl's actions and Clarke's anger, telling Clarke to leave the young slave alone and go about his day.  ","            Clarke's anger continued to build until he decided to take matters into his own hands late one evening.  Clarke beckoned the young slave girl to his living quarters and proceeded to discipline the girl himself, beating her until she became unconscious and  bringing her within inches of death.       Clarke's violent behavior angered the University of Virginia community.  Many felt that his actions negatively represented the community of scholars and that his actions should be evaluated by the faculty, a common practice at the University for any dishonorable act.  Clarke went before the faculty board, who reviewed his actions.  On May 3, 1856, the faculty board voted that Clarke's actions were inexcusable, requiring him to withdraw immediately from the University.  ","            Almost one full day later, Clarke responded to the faculty's decision in a letter requesting the board to reconsider its final verdict on his case.  Clarke acknowledged that his actions were dishonorable, however, he also wrote that he could have justified his actions with \"sufficient representation.\"  Days later, the faculty board at the University  of Virginia decided to rescind his withdrawal.  ","            The actions of W.D. Clarke and the response of the University of Virginia were particularly characteristic of the accepted social behavior of the slave South during the mid-nineteenth century.  A racially tense white society regularly scrutinized the behavior of slaves<strong>.  </strong>Masters would routinely discipline slaves who acted inappropriately.   Furthermore, it is also important to recognize the social implications that would result from disciplining a slave owned by another master during the nineteenth century.  It was considered illegal to discipline another master's slaves because slaves were the master's private property.    Clarke's defiant and violent behavior toward the young slave girl and the University's response exemplified the gravity of such actions in areas where slavery was a significant aspect of society.

The writer's real name was Reverend Julius J. Fleming, a prominent and outspoken citizen of Charleston widely respected for his roles as a preparatory school principal, a Methodist preacher, and earlier in his life, as the editor of the <em>Sumter Watchman</em>, a Charleston area newspaper. More importantly, however, the editorial Fleming penned shows a distinct knowledge of the fundamental problem that plagued Reconstruction South Carolina.","In the editorial letter that he penned in the <em>Courier</em>,<em> </em>one of dozens that he would write during his lifetime, Fleming addressed many problems that the Civil War had laid on South Carolina. In particular, Fleming's message also posed two significant queries relevant to the safety and survival of Southern culture: \"How can<em> </em>peace and quiet be permanently secured?\" and \"How and where will farmers find an adequate, reliable labor force?\" ","Interestingly enough, both of Fleming's questions hinged on one all-important aspect of Southern lifestyle, the slave labor agricultural system that had existed for nearly two hundred years at the time of the Civil War. Fleming, in his editorial, described slavery as \"the life-blood of secession and the real <em>casus belli</em> [cause of war],\" thereby showing that slavery's end was to be the single largest hardship faced during Reconstruction. On this note, he claimed that \"by one sweep the wealth of the country is taken away, and a people accustomed to wealth and ease are suddenly reduced to poverty, humiliation and toil.\" Fleming's idea of South Carolina's economic ruin as a result of emancipation was later supported by Civil War historian W. Scott Poole, who cited the disappearance of \"enormous wealth, founded as it had been on a now defunct social system.\"","There is no doubt that both questions Fleming posed were difficult ones to answer, especially considering the Union Army had freed a gigantic number of former slaves during their march through South Carolina. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the author developed several sensible answers to uncertainties faced not only in South Carolina, but the South as a whole, in his landmark editorial. Among these suggestions, Fleming's envisioned arrangement for agricultural change was particularly impressive, and featured a version of sharecropping in which wealthy planters would \"divide up a portion of their estates into small farms which emigrants can readily obtain by purchase or lease.\"  In the post-war South, Fleming's system was put to use on a large scale, and it lasted into the twentieth century. ","Across his editorial, Fleming displayed an acute knowledge of the problems to be faced as the result of slavery's demise in post-Civil War South Carolina. While there is no question that Fleming's editorial addressed on one hand \"a people picking up the pieces of an existence shattered and changed by war and defeat,\" there is also no question as to the overarching theme of his letter. This motif, of course, was not disquiet or misery, but rather an appreciation that \"the war [was] over never to be renewed.\""],"display_date":"July 22, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-22","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3933,"title":"The Huger House Fire in Clermont, South Carolina","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-03-17","end_date":"1821-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 17, 1821, a woman named Harriet Lucas Huger penned an affectionate letter to her aunt, Mrs. Harriott Horry, thanking her for expressing concern over the family's well-being.

","As Harriet Huger narrated in the letter to her aunt, the fire did no serious harm to the family. Although one of Harriet's daughters did suffer mildly from smoke inhalation after the blaze, the young mother's letter states plainly that \"the rest of the family [is] in good health,\" a fact that she looked upon with obvious gratitude.","Coincidentally, Harriet Huger's letter also described the family's intentions following the fire, saying that \"the greater part of our furniture was saved without much injury,\" and illustrating the family's plans for the near future. Part of a prosperous family (evidenced by the fact that Harriet, as a woman, could read and write exceptionally well), Harriet also mentioned that the family's \"two [slave] carpenters...immediately set about fitting up one of our outbuildings for our summer accommodation.\" ","With luxuries such as education and slave labor at their disposal, Harriet Huger and her family certainly belonged to South Carolina's planter class. In fact, according to South   Carolina historian Henry White, the affluent Huger-Pinckney family had been involved in large-scale rice planting since the first decade of the nineteenth century and owned \"among the rice fields...a spacious home.\" ","Despite their wealth, the devasting house fire <em>certainly</em> affected the Huger family. For one, the blaze destroyed an ancestral home of considerable value that had been passed down continuously over several generations. Also, as her letter clearly expresses, the burning of her house shook Harriet Huger emotionally, a fact she expresses to her aunt in the vain hope that her family \"be exempt from domestic calamity.\" Even so, Harriet and the rest of the Huger family were quite fortunate, for they rebuilt their plantation home within one year of the blaze due to the vast agricultural wealth held in the family coffers.","While the Huger family was quite privileged, both in their affluence and personal safety, the opportunities they enjoyed following their house fire were certainly not available to all Southern families.

The <em>Elizabeth City Star </em>declared that Liberia was to be more than just an \"African asylum,\" it was to be a \"light, which we trust in God, will light all of Africa with its fires.\"  Ships sent to Liberia carried many freed blacks and also missionaries in the hopes of forming a Christian colony and redeeming Africa.  ","The article briefly mentioned the idea that taking freed blacks away from their lives in America and sending them to Liberia, a place unfamiliar to most, may be \"a system of cruelty worse than slavery itself.\"  However, on the whole, the newspaper thought that the goals of the American Colonization Society were divinely ordained and beneficial to all.

Lane was born and raised in a relatively pleasant environment (compared to other slaves) on a large plantation with over 250 slaves.  As a child, Lane played with the white children, but as he grew up, Lane said, \"I discovered the difference between myself and my master's white children.\"  While they began to read and write, Lane began to work in the fields and was not permitted to touch a book.  However, throughout most of Lunsford Lane's experience as a slave, he worked as a \"body servant and waiter in his master's fine mansion\" and did not suffer the toils of fieldwork.  In fact, he seemed to appreciate living in North Carolina because he said there was a constant fear of being sold to the Deep South, where slavery was harsher.  As soon as Lane discovered the possibility of buying one's freedom, he set to work, night and day.  He began selling peaches and marbles whenever he had the chance and eventually sold prepared smoking tobacco and pipes at fifteen and ten cents each, becoming known as a tobacconist around town.  He worked and went into town to sell his products late at night and early in the morning, living an exhausting lifestyle.  Lane eventually married, and had six children, and raised 1,000 dollars to purchase his freedom.  Lane describes the feeling once freed, \"I cannot describe it, only it seemed as though I was in heaven.\"  Soon after, he bought his entire family for 3,000 dollars.

Dated December 21, 1822, the letter described some of the details of Perkins' journey, including an illness that befell one of his traveling companions, Betty: \"...all well exept bety and she has bin very sick on the road hardly expected her to liv and was very trobesom on the road with that not in her side....\"  The description of the \"not in her side\" seems to imply that Betty suffered from some kind of pain, or possibly even a bulge, on the side of her body.  Historian Thomas Wertenbaker asserts that medical knowledge in the antebellum South was rudimentary at best.  Especially in rural plantation societies like Virginia and Maryland, doctors were hard to find, and even if found they were not always likely to be consulted.  Many in the South believed that doctors did more harm than good, which is probably true considering their widespread use of such treatments as bloodletting and their lack of knowledge concerning germ theory.  In this light it is understandable why Perkins did not hold out much hope for Betty's survival.","      According to F. N. Boney, a number of Southern doctors in the antebellum period performed medical experiments on slaves.  Doctors used the prevailing belief that blacks were inferior to whites to justify the often grotesque procedures to which they subjected slaves.  They performed many experiments, including the trial of a new (and highly dangerous) vaccination procedure and even an effort to discover an effective surgical method for sealing clefts that caused bladder leakage.  Slaves endured unimaginable pain and suffering due to such atrocities, but in the doctors' minds it was all in the name of science.  Regardless of the means through which discoveries were made, medical science in the antebellum South left much to be desired.  Concepts that are considered self-evident today, such as germ theory, were unknown at the time.  Perkins described most of his traveling as such: it \"...was water Bound three times and was very mody....\"  Frequently surrounded by water and mud, his traveling party must have come into contact with an untold amount of pathogens.

The newspaper contained many other written editorials that expressed people's opinions.  The advice in this column, however, was more credible for others to read and follow because another farmer wrote the article.  As the quote suggests, every farm needed good quality tools to be efficient.  Along with good tools, good labor was the key to a productive farm.  Young, strong slaves made up this good labor force.  The article stated that in order to have a productive farm, one had to choose the best available slaves.  Owners must then treat their slaves with at least some care to keep them healthy.  A healthy labor force was an efficient one, according to the article.  Slave labor and good tools were the first steps to improving a farm's production.","This article demonstrated the importance of agriculture in Virginia and in the South at the time.  Agriculture drove the Southern economy, and it depended on a slave labor force.  In particular, there were 2,510 slaves in 1850 in Roanoke County; that number increased to 2,643 slaves in 1860.  Slaves were necessary for the Southern economy to work and function properly.  Slaves were so vital to the Southern way of life that they made up over thirty-six percent of the population of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South  Carolina, and Georgia.  Picking strong, capable slaves was the key to a productive farm during this time period.

Pinckney, a plantation owner in South Carolina, did not expect these men to continue working for free, but he realized that without them, his plantation was destined for failure. He stated simply, \"I acknowledged their freedom; did not expect them to work on the old terms, but would pay them for their labor, etc.\" Pinckney respected the knowledge of the land and agricultural work that these men had acquired while working for him, and for this reason he wished them to stay on his plantation. After his request, Pinckney received a largely negative response from these former slaves. Acknowledging their rights as free men, Pinckney told them that if they were to stay on his land they would have to work for him, but they were free to go wherever they wanted. The slaves found themselves in a frustrating bind. Fearing the failure of the federal paper currency (greenbacks), they wished to work for themselves instead of Pinckney employing them. They questioned the actions of the government, asking \"what good does it do for the government to give us our freedom and not give us land to plant?\" Pinckney, probably like most former plantation owners, was equally frustrated because his livelihood relied on the productivity of his plantation, and he could not possibly do all the work himself. ","    The free men did begin to work, but \"it was only starvation that brought them to it.\" Without any land, they could not provide food for themselves or their families, so they had to work under whatever conditions Pinckney offered. On Pinckney's plantation they were \"generally forced to adopt the share system.\" This share system became common throughout the South in the years following the war. In the early stages, the plantation remained the most common unit with free men working on it for a share of the crops, but soon enough a true sharecropping system developed. Black men were granted pieces of land to work, and when the year was over the owners returned to them a share of the crop produced. By 1870 sharecropping was so common in the South that it made any other system seem unusual. Sharecropping did not, however, allow the South to develop any more industry or diversify any more than it had under the plantation system, leaving it lagging far behind the North for many years to come."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3951,"title":"Southern Ladies\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-06-12","end_date":"1889-06-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    In an 1889 letter to her close friend, Mrs. Hannah Weisiger described her late mother as \"one of the noblest & dearest women on earth...so much good...yet so humble...of her good deeds.\" Throughout the nineteenth century, Southern women were idealized as the moral compass of the family, supposedly gentle and noble in deeds. Even in the latter part of the century, values firmly rooted in the pre-Civil War plantation culture remained prevalent. Mrs. Weisiger described her mother's virtues with special reverence as a woman whose life encountered many changes throughout the war and reconstruction years and yet still maintained her dignity as a Southern lady.

Although slavery instituted household demands on a pre-war plantation wife that were very different from that of a post-war southern wife, women were still expected to fill the same role within the family with or without the duties of managing a contingent of household slaves. Slavery provided southern white women an opportunity to embody certain leisurely ideals from a public view.

Being sold to the Deep South was possibly one of the greatest fears of many Upper or Border South slaves. The prospect of being sold away from family and friends was considered by some, a worse punishment than whipping. ","            According to historian William W. Freehling, economic growth, booming land sales, and the invention of the cotton gin encouraged the interstate slave trade as cotton was very profitable and grew more productively in more tropical climates.

In comparison, after the \"tobacco bust of the eighteenth century,\" the Border South was much more industrial, grew a wider variety of crops, and was more economically diversified and willing to sell their slaves \"down the river\" for a high profit. Most slaveholding southerners claimed to look down on these slave traders who made transactions possible, but according to historian Jeanette Keith, Isaac Franklin and his partner John Armfield were two of the most affluent and successful slave traders in the United   States. They later retired wealthy, purchased their own plantations, and married into elite families in Tennessee. They were also prominent Methodists. Many factors encouraged the slave trade during the 1820s and 1830s. Economics and profit to be gained in the cotton boom provided ample reason for traders to invest in this market.

The most promising option was to begin actively engaging in the slave trade.  Young healthy slaves could often sell for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  The recent migration of planters to the Mississippi Delta from the Chesapeake region had increased the demand for slaves even further.  Even some people from the North came to the region in order to enjoy the economic prosperity of the area.  Some of the migrants came not understanding slavery or even believing that it was unnecessary but ended up purchasing slaves nonetheless.

This is interesting because his brother, as a resident of Virginia, likely owned slaves himself or was at least exposed to slavery on a daily basis.  In fact, many slaves from Virginia and Maryland were sent to the Deep  South where the demand was much greater for them.  This was because the tobacco boom had come and gone in the Chesapeake while the cotton and sugar rush was just beginning in Louisiana.  The struggling farmer told his brother that the slave trade \"is both a positive good for master and slave.\"  It is easy to see what \"positive good\" the master received, but Kinney failed to mention how this process was beneficial to the slave.  He must have forgotten that slaves were often separated from their families and forced to start life anew whenever they were sold, causing much grief and heartbreak.

For Emma, the only highlight of the month appeared in the assassination of President Lincoln: \"After all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light.\" A common, unfortunate theme throughout her April diary entries was the rationing of food and a severe lack of funds available for more than the basic necessities. Though wearing homespun versus store-bought clothing items was a minor disturbance compared to the lack of food, her accustomed wealthy way of life was ruined. LeConte tried to keep some of her former lifestyle of leisure by trading French lessons for German coaching with a family friend, but as she realized that her usual \"Old South\" lifestyle was gone forever, her desperation set in.","The Confederate surrender would be the start of only harder times for South Carolinians like the LeConte family as well as other Southerners. Lee's formal surrender at Appomattox brought down the Confederacy in one written swoop. Economic times were already tough in the South, as most white men had mobilized with the Confederate armies and were unable to keep a steady eye on their farms at home; meanwhile, slaves voluntarily freed themselves from bondage without their masters' watch. Most women were powerless to run family businesses. The combination of these situations dropped the South into destitution even before the Civil War ended. Unpaid debts between Southerners and annihilated commercial centers such as Charleston and Columbia added further to the South's woes.

Though her concern for her father's ill health was quite natural, it was quite surprising to learn of her distaste for such a grand and important Southern city such as Charleston and her accompanying lack of \"any desire to visit town.\" Her large amount of leisure time, however, exposes Mrs. Huger's status as an elite white Southern woman. This detail is further expanded when she asked Mrs. Lowndes to buy her some material the next time she went to town \"for my gown, which I cannot finish\" without the proper material.

The elevated role of rich white women took a devastating turn, however, after the collapse of the Confederacy and the emancipation of slaves. As plummeting cotton prices forced the South into economic destitution, many women did not have the option of maintaining their work-free Southern womanhood and survived solely because they helped their husbands in the fields. Labor would have been considered absolutely improper for elite women before the war. Not only were the former Southern belles working in the fields, but Southern women were also responsible for the upkeep of the family home - this time without the help of slaves.

Advertisements present in the Norfolk-based newspaper attempted to sell goods such as Christmas supplies, hats, and chlorine tooth wash. While these impersonal objects were goods commonly traded and sold in the marketplace, the advertisement section also included references to Southern property that had run away from their masters. Perhaps the most telling aspect of these advertisements was that no significant distinction was made between missing cattle and missing slaves. To the slave master, steers and slaves were equal under the nature of the law: both were fundamental illustrations of private property. ","To comprehend the importance of the <em>Beacon's </em>advertisements, it is essential to understand the Southern belief that slaves were inherently the property of their masters. This prevalent reasoning had predated the Constitution and was deeply entrenched in Southern culture by 1832. Records from the debates of the Constitutional Convention, presented in the <em>Cambridge Modern History</em>, illustrate that Southerners held a consensus that \"slaves were property only; like other property, they were entirely subject to the wills of the master.\" This conception was no different from the perception regarding steers. In the two advertisements aforementioned, the descriptions of the missing cattle and runaway slaves relied solely upon physical peculiarities. While the two missing steers had \"marks under half moon under the right ear,\" the runaway slave named Lucy was \"stout\" with a \"very yellow complexion.\" In both circumstances, vested rights in private property possessed by the plantation owner dictated that the property be returned. ","The Southern perception of slaves as \"chattel property,\" mirrored in the two advertisements of the <em>American Beacon</em>,<em> </em>supports an underlying observation that blacks and cattle held equal rights under <em>de facto</em> Southern law. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"chattel\" is defined as \"a personal possession.\" As previously stated, slaves in the South were considered \"property...subject to the wills of their masters.\" The words \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" share a common language origin; both terms come from the Old French word \"chatel,\" which arises from the Latin word \"caput,\" meaning \"head.\" By relegating slaves to the restricted rights and properties of chattel, slave owners fundamentally equalized the rights of slaves and the rights of cattle. As a result, listing rewards for runaway slaves next to advertisements for runaway cattle, chlorine tooth wash, and medical elixirs was not conflicting in either intention or theory.  ","From expressed Southern mentality and advertisements found in the <em>Beacon</em>, it becomes readily apparent that blacks and whites were not regarded as equal beings under the encompassing mantle of equal protection. Blacks, bought and sold as mere chattel, were only regarded as equals to steers, \"glass beads,\" and \"harmonical walking canes.\" The subsequent equality under the law and inherent relation between steers and slaves was a founding principle of the Southern plantation economy, helping preserve the institution of slavery until the conclusion of the Civil War.

It is a tribute due to genuine patriotism and to unfaltering attachment to republican principles.\"","The Know- Nothing Party grew out of a secret society formed in New York in early 1849 by Charles B. Allen called the \"Order of the Star-Spangled Banner.\" Its original aim was to control nominations for elections rather than stand independently in elections, but in 1852 it merged with a new party called the American Party and it became directly involved in politics. The members of the American Party were nicknamed Know-Nothings, which referred to the response that they were meant to give when asked about the society's activities. The Know-Nothing Party was originally opposed to Catholic involvement in politics and the increasing numbers of foreigners in the country.  However, there was a split between Know-Nothings in the North and South, as those from the South played down their hostility to foreigners or Catholics as, on the whole, these issues were not as important to southerners. In some areas of the South, such as port cities, nativism was an important factor behind the growth of the Know-Nothing Party but elsewhere the Know-Nothing popularity \"was instead dependent on long-standing rifts between Democrats on economic policy and the sectional conflict.\"","The party did not last a long time but in the 1850s it was believed that they would become the official opposition party to the Democrats. The Know-Nothing Party was originally meant to be bi-partisan, but increasingly became involved in partisan politics, with the Democrats accusing them of being \"whiggery in disguise.\" The Democrats felt threatened by the Know-Nothings and so accused them of being against slavery, as this would ensure that the Know-Nothings would loose support in the South. <em>Nashville Union and American</em>, was resolutely Democratic and consistently criticized the Know-Nothing Party. In 1855 it even adopted the slogan \"let's get more European immigrants to settle in the South to help swell our numbers to defend slavery\" However, as Erik B. Alexander has argued, in reality, most Know-Nothings in the South were against the abolition of slavery.","In 1857 the Know-Nothing Party's influence in Tennessee politics ended. In 1856 their candidate in the presidential election came third, and in 1857 they lost Tennessee's Congressional elections.

Parmalee's commentary on the sectional crisis echoed the sentiments shared by many Southerners at the time. \"We are, as a people, in a state of considerable political excitement,\" he wrote of the Southern attitude. Parmalee then went on to discuss Southerners' desire for \"equal rights under the Constitution,\" a fundamental principle that Congress had, in his opinion, violated.

It had been deeply rooted in Southern culture for decades, and the recent rise of the abolitionist movement threatened that lifestyle both economically and socially.

Furthermore, when talking about another one of her black workers, Charles, and his sale, she said she, \"...witnessed to Charles's bill of sale.  I am sorry for him, but he has brought it on himself by his obstinate conduct.\" Despite apparent disorderly conduct, she did not exhibit disrespect for this slave. ","Southern women's perspectives were often not the forefront of the Southern mindset during this time period.  Although much literature focused on the male political turmoil of the slave South, many women of this time exhibited much softer emotions toward their slaves.  In her book, Within the Plantation Household, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese argues that southern slaveholding women were not unlike their male counterparts and commanded dominance over their slaves.  She also stated that southern white women even went as far as to defend slavery as an integral party of society.  Genovese's argument presents a contradiction to the attitude of Fannie Page Hume. Although Genovese wrote of the dominance of southern women over their slaves, Hume may portray an internal conflict that many of these women struggled with.  The sense of dominance may have been a faÇade as a method to retain white supremacy, while in reality many women experienced the same empathies of Fannie Page Hume toward their slaves.  Hume's sympathetic writings towards her slaves could have been done in secrecy while her actual practices were more akin to that of white supremacy."],"display_date":"1858 - 1859","search_date":"1858-12-31","locations":[{"id":14128,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3995,"title":" This Sin Polluted Earth\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-03","end_date":"1857-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On January 3, 1857 cries of pain echoed throughout the plantation.  The crack of the whip onto bare skin had an unmistakable sound.  All those who witnessed the brutal whipping cringed with each crack.  The slave's back was already covered with old scars; some several years old and some only days old.  Mary Boyden became used to seeing her father discipline unruly slaves, but this time she became disgusted with his behavior.","            Before Mary went to sleep on the night of January 3, 1857, she wrote in her diary as she did every night.   Normally, Mary would write about the weather and the people she had met throughout the day.  This entry, however, had a particularly different focus. Mary began this entry with the thought, \"another day has dawned upon this sin polluted earth,\" followed by an emotional, detailed description of the brutal whipping of a slave that she had witnessed early in the day.  Her father, an overtly bigoted, violent man, had senselessly beaten a slave in an attempt to solidify his superiority over the less-than-human slaves who worked on the plantation.  His futile actions had disgusted Mary, a religious adolescent girl who tended to sympathize with the slaves that her family had owned.  Mary had developed a substantial internal conflict between her personal ideals and the beliefs encouraged by her Southern Baptist religion. ","            Mary wrote about her personal hatred and disgust with the Southern culture, which heavily revolved around slavery.  She did not agree with the idea of slavery and wrote, \"white folks will have to pay for making slaves of the black folks, in the insurrection.\"  Mary no longer wanted to experience the routine whippings of the slaves, whom she had developed close relationships with.  She longed for a way to remove herself from the life that her family was so deeply imbedded in.   ","            Conflict between religion and slavery was not an uncommon dilemma in the slave South during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War.  Many deeply religious slave owners were even troubled by their own involvement with slavery.  Some slave owners who were particularly religious considered the institution of slavery to be evil and were often convinced that they would be going to hell.  However, Southern Christian churches often supported the idea of slavery.   Religious communities considered the institution slavery in terms of its social, political, and economic consequences as well as in terms of its ethical implications.  The majority of the religious communities, however, feared that emancipation would lead to devastating effects.   Slave owners used the views of their churches as a foundation to rationalize or justify their own involvement in slavery.  As a result, many slave owners considered slavery an economic and political issue that was beyond their control and ignored the ethical issues surrounding the institution.  Mary Boyden embodied this internal conflict which existed between her own ethical beliefs, her religion, and her family's use of slaves to bring in revenue.  This conflict proved to be a crucial weakness for many southerners fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

Charles' abrupt disappearance enraged his master, John C. Kerric. On November 22, 1851, Kerric wrote an impassioned letter to his friend, Robert T. Hubard, describing his unfortunate situation. Kerric explained that Charles ran away and was purchased by a plantation owner on the \"other side of the mountain.\" He questioned the legality of this man's purchase and asked Hubard to seek legal advice on the situation from a presumed lawyer and friend, Benjamin Graham. Also, Kerric sought to defend his social standing as a good master, proclaiming that he had established a decent house for his slaves and could not understand why Charles ran away.","After receiving Kerric's letter, Robert Hubard immediately initiated correspondence with lawyer Benjamin Graham. In his reply, Graham spoke first of the legal ramifications associated with the purchase of a runaway slave. Graham declared that a man's slave is his property for life, so Kerric still legally owned Charles. Graham also argued, however, that he understood why Charles had run away, explaining that Kerric was a \"cruel and harsh\" master. Even more, Graham defended the plantation owner who purchased Charles, complimenting his \"good plantation and content workers.\" Hubard relayed the lawyer's message to Kerric, and Kerric decided it would be best to sell Charles and end his trouble.","During the years preceding emancipation, planter society highly valued the ideal of paternalism. According to historian Drew Gilpin Faust, \"paternalism is the belief in a sense of stewardship, where some men are divinely appointed to be the guardians of others, justifying slavery as a positive good.\" The ideals of paternalism instructed masters to treat their slaves as a father would treat his child. Paternalism instigated a system of mutual obligation between slave and master; where slaves who were treated well were expected to act obediently. Most southern planters reasoned that in caring for slaves, in leading them out of barbarism, they were fulfilling God's will.","The correspondence between John Kerric, Robert Hubard, and lawyer Benjamin Graham illuminates many of the fundamental principles of paternalism. Drew Faust explains that paternalism was a social response to the South's obsessive fear of slave insurgency, seeking to control blacks as individuals and a race. The fear of slave insurgency, as in Kerric's situation, motivated many planters to take an interest in their slaves' well being. In the eyes of Kerric's community, his misfortune was warranted because he treated his slave harshly. The letters also illustrate that men who exercised paternalism were granted a certain level of respect. In his letter to Hubard, Kerric expressed deep fear that neighboring planters would cruelly criticize and judge him because of his slave's disappearance. Graham heightened this point by complimenting Charles' new<em> </em>master for his \"good plantation and content workers;\" insinuating that he might have been a better fit master than Kerric. Overall, paternalism provided an ideological and emotional context in terms of which individuals approached slavery and within which they legitimated their consequent social actions."],"display_date":"November 1851","search_date":"1851-11-15","locations":[{"id":13889,"lat":36.6763018346,"lng":-77.5590329782,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENSVILLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4002,"title":"The Brewing Political Atmosphere of the 1850s\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-01","end_date":"1856-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the weeks leading to the United States presidential election of 1856, the future of the union seemed to hinge on the issue of slavery. <em>The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser</em>, a semi-weekly newspaper that was distributed throughout Richmond during the 1850s, published a series of articles expressing the southern Democrats' staunch opposition to federal interference in slavery. The articles captured the South's passionate desire to defeat the abolitionist Republican Party. They called upon all southerners who \"cherished the principles of their revolutionary fathers, to unite [against the Republicans].\" An article published on May 6, 1856 entitled, \"The Staunton Convention\", warned southerners to seize immediate political control, claiming that a Republican victory would lead to total destruction of the South. The article also offered advice to southern politicians, insisting that they rest all action on one unequivocal basis: the Constitution.

A Democratic victory appeared to be the sole alternative to the catastrophe of disunion.

Two white male adults, presumably acting as professors, stood before the African-American student body.

One February day, after a delivery, Anthony secretly boarded a \"Baltimore clipper\" headed to Boston with the goal of finally attaining his freedom.   He spent three grueling weeks balled up in a space hardly big enough for his body, fighting the cold and the rocking of the sea. Upon arrival in Boston, he was relieved, believing that he had finally become a free man. ","On May 24, 1854, fugitive slave hunter, Asa O. Butman, approached Burns on a street in Boston and accused him of stealing from a jewelry store. He subsequently arrested Burns and escorted him to a room where his former master, Charles F. Suttle, was waiting for him.  Under the authority of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, Suttle explained, Burns was being arrested and taken back into slavery. Burns' arrest sent shockwaves throughout Boston, and on May 26, a mob attacked the Boston courthouse, attempting to free Burns. They were unsuccessful in their efforts, and Anthony Burns went to trial with his freedom at stake. The judge, U.S. Commissioner Edward G.

After he had served his term, a plantation owner from Rocky Mount, North Carolina purchased him from Mr. Suttle, and they stole away shortly after, during the middle of the night.

The Reverend Leonard A. Grimes, who had tried to purchase Burns after his initial arrest, had been tipped off as to the slave's situation and offered the owner 1300 dollars for Anthony's freedom.

"," The use of slave labor in Florida was centered on King Cotton, which was essential to the prosperity of the South.  The emergence of slavery in Florida began with the development of the Georgia-Florida frontier, where most believed that slaves were property rather than human beings.  Furthermore, many Floridians feared that the Seminole Indians would threaten southern dominance over their slaves.  Floridians were very suspicious that the Seminoles allied with their slaves and planted thoughts of escape in their minds.  Having forced the Seminoles into the interior swampland of Florida during the Seminole Wars, the United States never extracted this community and eventually handed reserve territory over to the tribe.  Thus, the Seminoles of Florida became a combination of runaway African slaves, indigenous people, and impoverished people from various cultures following the United States' displacement and extermination of their traditional culture.

Despite this, the anti-slavery movement did take hold in parts of the South. A select few accepted the belief that slavery was immoral and should be abolished.  Holding beliefs contrary to those of their southern counterparts, some abolitionists were tried and imprisoned for such \"radical\" thoughts concerning slavery.  In the 1849 letter, Margaret told her son of one man who had been imprisoned in Jamaica for \"exciting the negroes to rebellion.\"  Such a strict punishment for the opposition of slavery illustrated the use of slavery as a crutch that steadied the South, both economically and socially, before the Civil War.

In the ad, Andrews discussed his willingness to negotiate with Virginians who wished to \"send their Negroes to Texas, in farming there, from one to ten years... and divide the net profits on just and equitable proportions.\" It seemed as if Andrews was attempting to start some type of business or partnership with slave owners in Virginia, and the tone of his writing alluded to the idea that his plan was one that had been implemented and been successful among other agricultural entrepreneurs. Andrews' proposition illustrated the desire of those residing in the new frontier lands of the Southwest to make both slavery and agriculture profitable in an area that many people hoped would become the new South. Just as it seems that John Andrews had done, in the years following Thomas Jefferson's acquisition of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, many Americans began moving west into the frontier in hopes of gaining more land as well as finding the agricultural success that many plantation owners had found in the American South. Settlers began stretching across the midwestern section of the United States into areas such as Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas.

I will do so.\" In the early 1840s, people began to realize that Texas served as a great source of rich soil for farming and attracted the attention of upper South slaveholders such as Andrews. As the years went on, it became evident that slavery was going to be a very large part of the growth and prosperity in the new state.

President of Washington College and slaveholder Dr. Henry Ruffner delivered an address in 1847 that outlined the evils of slavery and proposed the gradual eradication of slavery from western Virginia.  In correspondence to Messrs. Moore, Letcher, &c, Ruffner wrote, \"as we are nearly all slaveholders, and none of us approve of the principles and measures of the sect of abolitionists, we think that no man can be offended with us for offering to the people an argument whose sole object is to show that the prosperity of our West Virginia-if not East Virginia also,--would be promoted by removing gradually the institution of slavery, in a manner consistent with the rights and interests of slaveholders.\"  He delivered this speech first to the Franklin Literary Society of Lexington, Virginia, at the close of debates on the division of the state of Virginia.  Ruffner afterwards compiled his emancipation argument into the \"Ruffner pamphlet,\" which made its debut in September 1847.  Throughout his speech, Ruffner rejected the extremes of both abolitionism and pro-slavery extremism, claiming the \"middle way.\"","Unlike the abolitionists, who objected to slavery on moral grounds, Ruffner objected to the economic problems that slavery created.  His protest matched that of trans-Allegheny legislators who called slavery the sure route to economic stagnation.  In western counties, such as the Kanawha Valley, where Ruffner spent his childhood, slavery was not profitable and often took jobs from white laborers.  He argued that, \"our own West Virginia furnishes conclusive evidence, that slavery....has a pernicious influence on the public welfare.\"  Most people in western Virginia engaged in livestock and small farming operations where slavery was not economical.  Industries, such as the Kanawha salt industry, leased and hired slaves, often from eastern Virginia, for lower wages than white laborers demanded.  Any such encouragement to the growth of slave population west of the Blue Ridge, Ruffner felt, was dangerous to the free labor population.  He compared the slave states with free states to provide concrete examples of his logic-\"In the older free states are seen all tokens of prosperity....  In the older parts of the slave states, -with a few local exceptions,-are seen, on the contrary, too evident signs of stagnation or of positive decay....\"  Thus, as Ruffner reasoned, the institution of slavery would not allow the western Virginian economy to prosper.  It was on this basis that Ruffner placed his overall argument.","Ruffner united his discussion of slavery with the \"white basis\" for representation in the legislature, asserting that the two were intertwined.  Representation in the Virginia General Assembly favored eastern Virginia over its western counterpart due to the imbalance of slave populations.  Indeed, western politicians were bitter against east Virginia for using their power to retain the mixed basis of representation and to deny to western Virginia its rights.  Ruffner's argument was coherent with the general sentiments of westerners at the time who attacked both the practice of unequal representation and the institution of slavery.  In them, they saw the sole causes of their political degradation and of their arrested social and economic development.  Historian Charles Ambler noted that \"arguments opposing and supporting these two extremes were poured forth in profusion in the Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 and in the assembly of 1831-1832, where the expediency of legislating upon the abolition of negro slavery was the chief subject of discussion.\"  Ruffner reminded his audience of the measure introduced in Virginia's legislature proposing gradual emancipation:  \"and so the people of West Virginia then thought, for they were generally and warmly in favor of it, and zealously advocated it through their able and patriotic Delegates.  But in spite of their efforts, it was rejected by the all powerful Eastern majority, though several Eastern delegates joined the West in its support.\" ","In the conclusion of his argument for the necessity of action to remove the institution of slavery from West Virginia, Ruffner outlined a scheme for such a removal with six major components.  He proposed foremost that further importation of slaves be prohibited and that the exportation of slaves be freely permitted (with the exception that children of slaves born after a certain day, not be exported after they had reached five years of age).  Next, he advised that the existing generation of slaves remain in their present condition (but that their offspring born after a certain day should be emancipated at no later than 25 years of age).  Furthermore, Ruffner felt that masters should be required to teach the \"heirs of emancipation\" reading, writing and arithmetic, that the emancipated slaves be colonized, and finally, that the law allow any county to decree the removal or emancipation of all slaves of the county within a certain term of years.  ","  It was not until eighteen months after Ruffner's death, when the Union admitted West Virginia as a legal state, that its constitution provided for a gradual emancipation plan similar to the system proposed by Ruffner.  The legal emancipation of slaves in West Virginia did not take place until February 3, 1865, when the governor approved an act abolishing slavery, providing for the immediate emancipation of all slaves.  They had finally taken the course of action that Ruffner had called for--\"Now fellow citizens, it is for you to determine whether the slavery question shall be considered, discussed and decided, at this critical, this turning point of your country's history...may heaven direct your minds to the course dictated by patriotism, by humanity and by your own true interest.\"  "],"display_date":"September 1847","search_date":"1847-09-15","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4033,"title":"The Slavery Question in Kentucky\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-27","end_date":"1865-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"Slavery is regarded by the masses as the fruitful source of all our woes, and as inimical to our future peace and unity.\"  In a letter to Kentucky Governor Thomas Bramlette, Brigadier General Brisbin urged Bramlette to devise a remedy for the growing evil of the disturbed labor force throughout Kentucky. Bramlette agreed that the \"evil necessity\" had become an \"incumbus upon our energies, a burden to our advancement, and a negative to our prosperity.\" ","As a border state, Kentucky lacked the labor-intensive staple crops, such as cotton and tobacco, that were necessary to support slavery, and the average size of slaveholdings in Kentucky was the fourth smallest in the South.  With a long history in the antebellum years of moderation and compromise, Kentucky provided an atmosphere conducive to antislavery advocates.  However, even such advocates lacked a willingness to take firm action.  Most believed that slavery was a necessary instrument for controlling the state's black population.  During the war, Kentucky became firmly committed to the Union yet remained governed by a coalition opposing all policies that challenged slavery.  State officials denounced the Emancipation Proclamation as unconstitutional and refused to recognize the liberty of any black person claiming or pretending to be free.  It is this very resistance that General Brisbin so ardently disfavored in his letter: \"slavery is at an end, and why deny it, or, by withholding proper State legislation, seek to retain longer the shadow of an institution that was always worthless?\"","Brisbin advanced his argument by describing the condition of slavery and labor in Kentucky.  He wrote, \"the master can no longer hold his slaves or depend on their labor for a single day, so that producers cannot calculate their crops or pursue agriculture with any degree of certainty.\"  Indeed, the war undermined the exclusive authority of master over slave.  Slaves quickly learned that authority and protection resided with the Union army when unionist slaveholders could not protect their slaves against Confederate invaders.  Conversely, when federal military lines moved into areas previously held by Confederate forces, slaveholders who had sympathized with the Southern army fled, leaving property and slaves behind.  Most of these abandoned slaves immediately assumed the stance of free blacks.","By December 1862, Kentucky slaves were moving in such numbers that it became impossible to exercise control over them.  Brisbin related this occurrence: \"having become restless or dissatisfied, the slaves leave their homes, and setting their faces toward Louisville, journey for days over long miles to these headquarters, as the Mecca where freedom may be found....\"  By this time, it had become common for Kentucky slaves to ask for wages in return for their labor.  When denied, slaves often fled the plantation.  ","Over time, slaves had begun to make personal decisions without regard for the authority of the slaveholder.  Another popular movement of slaves was the enlistment of black men and boys into the army.  These enlisted slaves became freedmen, a circumstance that in itself weakened the institution of servitude in Kentucky.  Brisbin also noted that \"Negro enlistment has bankrupted slavery in Kentucky, over 22,000 of the most valuable slaves having gone into the service.\"  Indeed, by war's end, Kentucky had mustered 23,703 blacks into federal service.  ","The departure of slaves from Kentucky to the Northeast as wage earners, movement of blacks to towns and cities, and enlistment of the Kentucky slaves in military service all combined to create an acute labor shortage in Kentucky by 1865.  Indeed, Brisbin reasoned, \"Kentucky needs what black labor she has left to till the soil, and her slaves can now be of more service to the nation in the corn fields than in the army....\"  He concluded his letter by proposing that freeing the slaves in \"one blow\" would end the questionable status of labor in Kentucky.  Brisbin wrote, \"the sooner Kentucky makes up her mind and accepts the new order of things, and to establish labor upon a free, paid basis, the better it will be for her.\"","Though the formal emancipation of slaves in Kentucky did not take effect until the United States adopted the Thirteenth Amendment, it had ceased to be a \"viable institution\" long before then.  It had suffered such afflictions that left no hope for its reestablishment as it had existed before war.  Still, slavery had been more deeply entrenched in Kentucky than elsewhere in the border region.  At war's end, more than sixty-five thousand slaves remained in bondage, and it would take decades of further persistence for Kentucky to embrace racial equality."],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":4979,"lat":38.1872796075,"lng":-85.6593965884,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4039,"title":"The Assault of Charles Sumner\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-01","end_date":"1856-06-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The \"chastisement of Senator Sumner\" by Senator Brooks in the United States Senate came under heavy criticism in both the Northern and Southern United States.  While the Northern reaction was a more conciliatory tone towards Sumner and one that called for the punishment of Brooks, the Southern reaction was that it was a ploy by Northern abolitionists to further the fight to end their way of life, slavery.  In the Raleigh<em> Register</em> the attack on Sumner was characterized as necessary to preserve the dignity of the Senate \"in order to command the respect of the public.\"  Yet at the same time, criticism in the <em>Daily Herald</em>, another newspaper in North Carolina, showed that all Southerners did not support Brooks's actions because they gave more momentum to the \"freesoilers\" of the North.  So while some Southerners did not approve of the actions of Senator Brooks, they more so disliked the aforementioned actions because they felt it gave abolitionists and freesoilers more power in the United States Senate than because they felt sympathy for Sumner.","The Slave Power Conspiracy griped the minds of both Southern and Northern Americans at this time, but it was more powerful and influential in the Southern United States, where slavery was an everyday aspect of life.  This spilled over into the dialogue and actions that took place in the representative bodies of the population, especially in the closely divided House of Representatives and the United States Senate.  Historian Edward Ayers addressed the idea of Southern honor in <em>Vengeance and Justice,</em> commenting that \"Southern violence possessed its own rules and unfolded on its own schedule.\"  The Southerners feared that the North would outnumber them in Congress, then take away their right to take their \"property\" with them into the new territories, and eventually bring about an end to their entire way of life; slavery.  This fear drove Southerners to view the North as being full of abolitionists and freesoilers who wanted to end the way of life that they had established and upheld since the colonial period, which made it necessary for them to fight back against it."],"display_date":"May 1, 1856 - June 6, 1856","search_date":"1856-05-19","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4040,"title":"James Brady: Chronicles of a Devoted Businessman on the James River\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-05-08","end_date":"1832-07-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By the waning sunlight, a fairly young merchant by the name of James Brady poured his eyes over a financial document.  It was proof that his business relations with an associate, William Tompkins, Sr., had finally bore fruit.  Mr. Tompkins waited over three years to pay James Brady for debts dating back to May 1829.  The large quantities of bacon, corn, nails, and planks had accumulated into a bill of 65.61, no small sum.  Brady let out a sigh of relief.  With this money he could expand his investments into the booming slave trade, which was far more lucrative than five hundred nails at 4.37.  James Brady became a fairly active slave trader, handling not a few transactions in the 1840s and 1850s, due to diligent effort but also to exterior factors. ","With the acquisition of lands of the southwestern frontier from the Creek Indians, Mississippi and Alabama were states by 1819, expanding the influence of the Slave South.  Between this and the ability of the cotton gin to enable a profit from lesser-grade, short-staple Southern cotton rose to the nation's top cash crop by 1830.  Due to the increase in demand for labor and no legal slave importation, deep Southern planters turned to Maryland and Virginia to supply labor.  Merchants like James Brady came into the picture here, buying and selling slaves for a profit on a route between Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.  According to Michael Tadman's <em>Speculators and Slaves</em>, states with large populations like Virginia exported slaves to the expanding southern cotton and (in Louisiana's case) sugar states.  When the international slave trade ended in 1807, dependence on states like Virginia grew greatly, leaving traders like James Brady in a position to turn quite a profit.  Treating black people like property, individuals such as James Brady separated children from their mothers, endearing dealers to no one North or South. ","Looking over his financial records and personal letters, James Brady was no Simon Legree, the evil slave trader from Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  James Brady kept thorough financial records and took advantage of a business opportunity.  Because individuals like him had to be callous at times, it was easy to personify all the ills of slavery into one form, thus actually delaying a critical look at the peculiar institution."],"display_date":"May 8, 1829 - July 25, 1832","search_date":"1830-12-15","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4041,"title":"Virginia Gazette: Epic of a Small-Time Newspaper\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-01-07","end_date":"1826-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A man swept into a dimly lit tavern and muttered, \"Whiskey,\" in a hoarse voice before collapsing into a creaky wooden chair.

Bacon, a writer for \"The Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery\" published a statistical pamphlet in 1859 reflecting African American advancements in the nation's first capital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He acquired the statistics by examining the number of blacks associated with particular institutions. Bacon hoped to illustrate his belief that African Americans, just like white men, women, and children could enjoy the rewards of economic progress if given the opportunities of every citizen. The introduction of the new liberties and opportunities provided a chance for growth among the members of the black population in a time which faced great segregation and racism. ","The overall culture of Philadelphia in the 1830s through the 1850s rewarded many blacks who witnessed a new era of political ideology. During this time the city established new liberties such as access to a variety of schools for their children, decreased numbers in convicted persons, and also increased opportunities in mechanical trades. The new possibilities provided a foundation for greater achievement and acceptance into the dominant white culture that encompassed the United States. ","African American children received new opportunities to attend public, private, and reformatory schools. The schools had been refurbished to provide an improved atmosphere for learning. The education efforts afforded to many of the African American students is undeniably associated with Protestant reform. Perhaps one of the most prominent schools for black children was the House of Refuge for Colored Children, established in Philadelphia in 1850. Walter Trattner, a twentieth century scholar, expressed the popular opinion shared by many whites in the North during this time period: \"…in an attempt to cope with the disturbing social and economic conditions and to restore a sense of community to urban America, moralism succeeded benevolence, public aid and private charity were transformed into mechanisms for social control\". The foundation of this school allowed young African American inmates to move out of prison and into reform schools.","The level of tension between races may also be witnessed within the labor market. In 1838, the number of occupations made available to African Americans spanned across 134 categories in Philadelphia. In these categories, 997 consisted of African American workers. Historian Cecil Frey pointed out that in the late eighteenth century the slaves and free men were encouraged to participate in mechanical trades which increased competition between black and white communities. The encouragement did not last long, and according to Benjamin Bacon a majority of the workers within the trades were forced to desert their trades because of increased racial prejudice throughout the city. Few exceptions existed in this community; James Forten, being one of them, was still given boundaries to stand within regards to his 'natural' status. ","The most significant numbers revealed within the pamphlet seem to portray an ambivalent step towards leniency in African American sentencing. The proportion of white men versus African American men in the Philadelphia county prison switched from an equal level in 1835 to almost three white men to one black man in 1858. Willliam J. Mullen, a prison agent, stated within the pamphlet, \"To myself it seems the above list shows the conditions, moral, and civil, of the colored race, to have greatly improved within the last 23 years, and to be far higher at this moment than it was at the commencement of that period.\" At quick glance this assumption seems to be true, but as mentioned previously, the decline in number of African Americans in prison can also be attributed to the opening of the House of Refuge for Colored Children, which took the children out of prison and put them into reform school."],"display_date":"1835 - 1839","search_date":"1837-07-01","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4049,"title":"Frederick Douglass and his dream to escape\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"I was only a slave; my wishes were nothing, and my happiness was the sport of my masters.\" During Frederick Douglass's life he experienced separation from his family, the death of both an old friend and his grandmother, and his escape from slavery. In his early twenties, Frederick Douglass was sent to Baltimore to serve a farmer named Captain Antony, but after Captain Anthony's death his future was unknown. Sent away to be valued along with the rest of the Captains' property, Douglass had visions of never seeing his family or his home city of Baltimore ever again. In his memoir, he talked about how the lives of cattle and swine were viewed equally with those of African American descent. This was a common feeling shared by many other slaves at the time. Despite both his sadness and humiliation, Frederick was overjoyed when he was informed that he was now in the possession of Mrs. Lucretia, the daughter of his previous master, and was going to see his family again in Baltimore. ","Frederick talked about how Mrs. Lucretia had taken care of him since his early childhood and was one of the only white Southerners whom he could trust. Within a few months of living with Mrs. Lucretia, Frederick Douglass was faced with another hardship, as he found out that she was deathly ill and was going to die soon. This now meant that all her possessions, including both Frederick and his grandmother, had to be auctioned off to a new farmer. Frederick's inability to know where his home was was a very common feeling shared by most slaves during the nineteenth century. ","The constant trading and buying of slaves was a hard fact that many slaves were forced to deal with in Baltimore during the nineteenth century. The only way to ensure that families would be reunited was to pay the Masters. When slaves became free, some owners would allow males to buy back family members who had been separated from the family. In <em>The Slave Narrative</em> one slave was given the opportunity to buy back his family from their master. 'At the end of the first year, plans were made with his wife's mistress for the purchase of his wife and two youngest children. The owner fixed their price at eight hundred dollars and gave him twelve months in which to raise the money.\" This was the only way that freed black men could guarantee that their family would not be sold somewhere else. Being able to reunite with separated family members helped many African Americans get through the troublesome years of the nineteenth century.

At this point in Douglass's life he worked for Mr. Freeland, and even though he considered him a friend, the idea of being enslaved his entire life gave Frederick the drive to escape. It was the beginning of 1836, and Fredrick thought about all the years he wanted to escape but never took any action. He decided that this year was going to be different; instead of thinking and dreaming about freedom he was going to make it happen. \"The thought of only being a creature of the present and the past, troubled me, and I longed to have a future-- a future with hope in it.\" Frederick and five other slaves devised a plan to escape on the following Saturday. His memoir takes the reader into the mind of a slave as he described the anxiety that the six of them faced leading up to the escape. The night before, they could not sleep because of the fear of what would happen if they got caught. They had all dreamed about escaping before but the next morning it was actually going to happen. On the morning of the planned escape they went about their normal duties in the field and right before they were going to run away, everything changed. Somehow word had gotten out about their plan and the six of them were confronted by Mr. Freeland along with six other men. Frederick knew that Sandy, one of the slaves who was going to escape with them, betrayed them out of fear. This shows how even though many slaves dreamed of freedom, the idea of being caught stopped many from taking action. The fear of what could have happened kept many African Americans enslaved during the nineteenth century. This would not be Frederick's last attempt toward freedom.","Many years after Frederick Douglass' escaped slavery he was still being sought after. In <em>The Slave Narrative</em> it talks about how even though Douglass was in the North, he still feared for his life. \"As soon as his narrative was published on the first of June, 1845, Douglass realized that it was necessary for him to leave New England for old England, because his revelation of the concrete facts of his experience in slavery had disclosed his identity, and he was at any moment thenceforth in danger of recapture.\" This shows how even after slaves became free their lives were still in jeopardy. Their lives were filled with the constant fear of what would happen if they were caught. Even though slaves faced fierce punishments if captured, there was still a chance they would become free. In many cases, the punishments diminished slaves' dreams of becoming free but some still saw a light at the end of the tunnel.

The economy of the South was still dependent on agriculture, however, as most of its land consisted of rural areas that needed to be farmed. Former slaves, now freedmen, were no longer bonded to harsh labor without benefits. Emancipation resulted in contracts between ex-masters and freedmen agreeing upon paid labor. In return for minimal pay and shelter, African Americans would work on land belonging to white landowners. On the land of George  C. Hannah in Charlotte County, Virginia, former slaves shared a similar experience.  On January 1, 1867, Hannah established a written agreement between himself and the freedmen he hired to work on his land. The agreement would last for the entire year until December 31, 1868, when another would be put into effect. After the expiration of each contract, another would be put into effect for the next year.","            According to Julie Saville in <em>The Work of Reconstruction</em>, slaves had many hard won rights, but were still guaranteed only minimal sustenance and shelter that had to be earned through labor. The nine different workers on Hannah's land, some of whom had families and were formerly slaves, were expected to \"bind themselves to work diligently and faithfully, obeying all orders.\" As long as the freedmen complied fully with every rule and regulation, Hannah would pay them in proportion to their work effort and in accordance with the number of family members each had. The payments ranged from a minimum seventy-two dollars per year, awarded to a single man named Cornelius, to one hundred and sixty dollars for a family of four. Money earned was accompanied by some obligations, however. Some workers had family members who lived in the housing provided by the landowners, and they were obligated to give a certain percentage of their earned wages to landowners in return for the provided living arrangements. ","            Although slaves had a new found freedom after the Civil War, they still had a \"continued liability to punishment for their faults and crimes,\" according to Saville. African Americans working in the paid labor system faced punishment at the discretion of land owners. In the case of George C. Hannah, if any of the freedmen left their employment before the expiration of the year, or should he have had a \"cause to discharge any of them before such time for neglect of duty, violation of orders, or any improper conduct whatever,\" they would be expelled from their work and forced to forfeit one half of their earned wages for the year."],"display_date":"January 1, 1867 - December 1, 1870","search_date":"1868-12-16","locations":[{"id":13732,"lat":37.0115838339,"lng":-78.6616403562,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLOTTE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4058,"title":"Post-War Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-06-01","end_date":"1870-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The aftermath of the Civil War was destructive to the morale of many Southerners as it imposed economic, agricultural, and social devastation.

Although these two relatives lived in regions with opposite political views, Sarah made it clear that she believed all members of the Miller family should respect each other, regardless of where they resided. In on of her first letters, Sarah acknowledged that the people of the North believed that Southerners are terrible sinners \"destitute of all honorable feelings,\" but hoped that her cousin Mary thought about her often.","            Following the war, it was almost impossible for Sarah to visit her cousin Mary in Philadelphia due to the numerous duties she needed to perform without the aid of slaves.

William White wrote a narrative about African American Preachers. In it he tells the story of a black preacher known as \"Uncle Jack.\" Slave traders kidnapped Jack from Africa when he was seven years out and sold him into slavery in Nottoway, Virginia. When he was forty he heard a Presbyterian Minister from Prince Edward County preach and became religious. White wrote  that once Jack found religion he wanted to learn to read so that he could study the bible. He convinced his master's children to teach him by \"promising to reward them for their pains with nuts and other fruits, as tuition fees.\" Once he learned to read, he received his license from the Baptist church and began to preach. In Nottoway at this time there were not many churches and Jack was \"often called to preach at a distance of more than thirty miles from his home.\" Additionally Jack \" secured the respect and confidence of the white people,\" as well as the adulation of blacks, and when his master died he was able to buy his freedom thanks to donations from white members of the community. ","Uncle Jack's experience as a black preacher was not typical. Many white southerners were hostile to black preachers after 1831 because of the slave rebellion lead by Nat Turner, a slave preacher, which was responsible for the death of 57 white men, women and children.  Slave owners passed laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read or write, and encouraged slaves to attend services given by white preachers who indoctrinated them with the idea that good, hardworking slaves who respected their masters would go to heaven. ","There are several reasons why Uncle Jack might have been exempt from these restrictions. The first is that he did not fit white stereotypes about slaves, especially in terms of his speech. White wrote, \"the reader must not be surprised, therefore, that nothing occurs in what we quote from his own lips, of the jargon peculiar to the African race. Nobody ever heard the good old preacher say massa for master or me for I.\" Another reason he may have been exempt from restrictions was that he rejected typical \"slave\" style preaching. In particular \"he uniformly opposed, both in public and private, every thing like noise and disorder in the house of God. His coloured auditors were very prone to err in this way. But whenever they did, he suspended the exercises until they became silent.\" Whatever the reasons, Uncle Jack achieved something extraordinary through his religion and lived a life unlike most other slaves because of it.

The possibility of an insurrection of the newly autonomous group of freedmen in their area terrified the white men of Matthews County. According to the 1860 and 1870 census, freedmen composed almost one half of the population in Matthews, and if united, they could pose a threat to white landowners. The <em>Norfolk Virginian</em> claimed that \"Negroes [were] ... buying arms wherever they [could] procure them\" and \"uttering serious threats.\" This spirit of revenge was thought to exist in freedmen throughout Virginia and the entire South. Conflicts between the freedmen and whites stemmed from the fact that freedmen did not want to be employed by whites under year-long contracts or other conditions similar to slavery.","White fears of \"Negro domination\" manifested themselves in various ways, such as the formation of a militia in Matthews County, Virginia. In other areas of the South white supremacy groups such as the KKK formed to violently force the black community into submission through violence. Eric Foner discusses the conflicts of implementing a free labor system in the South in his <em>Short History of Reconstruction. </em>Fears of a takeover by blacks existed long before they became freedmen. During slavery, plantation owners lived in constant fear of the possibility of a slave revolt. The Thirteenth Amendment freed the slaves and opened the door to a world of free labor in the southern states. With increasing autonomy in their labor decisions it was plausible that freedmen may seek some sort of revenge on their previous masters. In general, however, most slaves did not desire to seek violent restitution for their time in slavery. Although some freedmen demanded land rights from their masters as payment for their labor during slavery, most focused on reuniting their families, educating themselves, and establishing a black community.  Blacks disliked the year long contracts because they did not allow them to choose the crops they planted and they did not repay them fairly for their labor. Eventually sharecropping emerged as a new form of tenancy that was touted as beneficial to both whites and blacks, and the contract system faded away."],"display_date":"December 4, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-04","locations":[{"id":14039,"lat":37.3887731419,"lng":-76.252448521,"zoom":10,"place":"MATHEWS, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4088,"title":"Exiled From Florida\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-01-01","end_date":"1845-01-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Florida was originally settled by Spaniards, in 1558.  With the arrival of the British colonies, the Carolinas attempted to enslave the Indians in and around the Florida and Georgia territories.  A boundary was formed between Carolina and Florida, but slaves, Indian and African alike, crossed the boarder into Florida and further into Indian Territory.  The numbers of exiled slaves became so great in 1736, they were acknowledged by the Floridians, being referred to as Maroons, and also became allies in defending the territory.  Georgia was formed as a free colony between South Carolina and Florida and used as buffer colony to protect the Carolina planters' slave interests.  However, in 1750, a Creek Indian Chief named Seacoffee left the tribe with a large group of followers.  They traveled from Alabama to Florida, and under the Spanish colonial policy, they were incorporated into the Spanish population and entitled to land in the territory of Florida.  They settled near the area of the Exiles and refused all Creek laws.  These exiles were called \"Seminoles\" by the Creek Indians, meaning \"runaways.\"  They elected their own chiefs and became their own tribe.  Some members intermarried with members from the Maroons, as the groups merged into one entity.  They lived together in villages where the Blacks could build their own houses and farm their own fields.  The Maroons paid a tax of corn, vegetables, and meat to the Seminoles in exchange for their protection against slave catchers.","            By 1812, Georgia pushed for the Federal government to annex Florida in order to control the Indians in the region, and to control the new problem of slaves escaping from Georgia to Florida.  With no response from the Federal government, Georgia declared war on the Territory of Florida in order to occupy the territory and ensure the safety and welfare of their people.  They searched to find Creek Indians and the Exiles, who were all thought to be runaway slaves by Georgians, and ended the struggled in May 1813, with nothing to show for it.  ","            This conflict went unnoticed to the rest of America because of the War of 1812, and British involvement in North America.  The British allied themselves with the Exiles and the Indians, trading and supporting them through weapons.  When the British withdrew from Florida in the spring of 1815, they left the Exiles with their fort and the entire magazine of military stores.","            Even though British troops withdrew, a portion of America soldiers remained along the Georgia frontier to maintain peace with the Indians.  General Gaines commanded the Southern frontier at Fort Scott.  Growing sentiment within the army to return the Exiles to their slave owners lead to the first slave-catching expedition, undertaken by the Federal government.  Meanwhile, Andrew Jackson urged that the Exiles in Florida were a threat to the security of America's boarders, especially since receiving weapons and a fort from the British.  Jackson wrote a letter to President Monroe explaining the need for annexing Florida in order to emigrate the Indians west of Arkansas.

Many other neutral Creeks followed him North of Indian Territory, which is now Oklahoma.","Colonel Douglas H. Cooper had been persuaded that 'Gouge' was a threat and had been offered support from E. H. Carruth, Indian Agent for the USA. He took 2000 troops, and began pursuing the refugees.

Quayle, believed there \"to be 1500 strongly posted\" Indians, including 500 Jayhawkers, but later they numbered 9000. The Confederates numbered 2500; both they and the refugees were \"ill equipped for the winter march or for military action.\"","Gouge camped with everyone near the Creek Council at Thlobthlocco when he heard about their pursuit. He began to \"fire the prairies,\" leaving nothing to be foraged; thus slowing down Cooper. With the burning, it was still \"so dark [they] could not distinguish an Indian from a white man at three paces,\" which didn't help any whites, but it was easier for Indians as they are better at seeing in the dark. The flickering of the many bush fires and the moving of the tall grasses contributed to the confusion.","Late November 19, the front of Cooper's men, believing they had made contact with Gouge's pickets, followed the fire-trailers who lead them into an ambush. Near to Round Mountain the Texans gave chase. They were fired upon by the fire-trailers and dogs were sent through the ranks to disturb the men; they got into rank as quickly as the situation allowed.

Finally, an agreement was reached.  In September of 1850 the provisions that would become the Compromise of 1850 were passed.  About a year later, on September 5, 1851, Winchester Graham, a representative from South Carolina, gave a speech in Barnwell, S.C. that defended his support of the Compromise measures.  In the beginning of his speech, Graham called the compromise \"...the greatest legislative victory to be found in the annals of our country and that the institutions of the South are now resting on firmer foundations than they ever had before...\"  Next, Graham gave an overview of the major pieces of the compromise.  First, Graham talked about the abolition of the slave trade in Washington, D.C.  He argued that this was of no consequence to the South and that the Congress had the power to regulate the commerce of the District of Columbia.  Second, he talked about the admittance of California as a free state.  He dispelled the myth that this was a policy of the Free Soil Party intended to entrap the South, and argued that slavery would never have come to California because of its climate and terrain.  Graham supported the admittance of California as a whole, instead of divided at the 36' 30' line of the Missouri Compromise, because if it had been split it would allow two free states to come into the Union instead of one.  Third, Graham argued that the Texas-New Mexico border act, long viewed as an assault on the slave state of Texas, was proposed by a southerner, Pearce of Maryland, and was beneficial to the Southern cause.  This measure helped the South because it paid of the debts of Texas and also gave the South \"40,000 miles of free territory\" to establish new slave states to bolster Texas and the South.  Finally, the Fugitive Slave Act was a major victory for the South because it allowed for greater protection and return of their property, the slaves.  In conclusion, Graham said that the Compromise led the nation away from the brink of succession; this succession would have caused a costly war that would have taken a horrific toll on the South. ","    The debate over the Compromise of 1850 was one of the most contentious and heated debates in the history of the United States Senate.  Political fanatics, from the North and South, objected to the measures, bringing the nation to brink of disunion and hostility.  Author John Waugh argues that the compromise was built on the back of the \"political middle\" with measures that were meant to appease the North, the admittance of California, and ones to appease the South, the Fugitive Slave Act.  While the other measures, especially the Texas-New Mexico border act, represented a political quagmire, from which both sides refused to relent.  In his defense of the Compromise, Graham interpreted all of the measures as strengthening the South, even the concessions to the North.  His speech was an appeal to his constituents, making them realize that the compromise, and his support of it, led them away form the disaster of succession while also helping the Southern cause.  Graham wanted his constituents to view the measures as a victory, not as a compromise, because it helped avoid the destruction of the Union and reinforced slavery in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-09-05","locations":[{"id":11437,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4146,"title":"Reconstructing the Constitution in South Carolina\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-01-14","end_date":"1868-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    The Civil War was over, but the fight to ensure that it was not fought in vain was just beginning.  After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4526,"title":"&quot;Union Soldier Writes to Enslaved Daughters&quot;","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-09-03","end_date":"1864-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Spotswood Rice was a black Missouri soldier in the Union army in 1864.

This, Hummel states, \"brought thunderous outrage,\" from the southern population, which may have been a reason why Rice's children were not given to him by the slave holder.   ","Black soldiers were not permitted to fight for the Union at the start of the war, and even when they were allowed to, they had to earn the respect of whites.  No matter what the feelings were towards blacks at the time, their importance could not be denied.  Historian James M. McPherson states that blacks fighting for the north \"gave an important impetus to the Union war effort.\"  ","Spotswood Rice's letter illustrates one instance of a black mans experience in the Union army, and how he hoped it helped save his children from slavery.  It also shows the type of feelings blacks had for slave holders of the time.  Rice had very strong feelings of revenge for his daughter's master, and was not afraid to tell her about it.  Like many other blacks, Rice used the Union army as a way to get a type of revenge on the southern way of life.

The issue of this debate was participation in the Democratic Party National Convention at Baltimore, Maryland-where the party's Presidential nominee was to be decided.  The Baltimore Convention was the second such attempt; Democrats had met earlier from April 30th to May 3rd in Charleston, South Carolina for the same purpose.  There, the majority of the Lower South delegation (as well as a few from the Upper South) felt that the convention had grown hostile to their interests and had failed in its duty to protect the Constitutional right to slavery.  They cited as evidence the primacy of Stephen A. Douglas supporters at the convention and the establishment of a platform that ambiguously endorsed his idea of popular sovereignty for determining territorial slavery.   The disaffected delegates withdrew from the convention and set up their own caucus nearby.  From there, most \"bolters\" expected that they could negotiate their interests with greater leverage and, ultimately, rejoin the National Party.  However, the decision of the National Party Convention to adjourn from Charleston and reconvene on June 18th in Baltimore forced confrontation.  The decision made clear that the National Convention would not just submit to Southern demands.  Yet probably the move's most powerful, and inadvertent, impact was that it removed the breakaway delegation's ability to quietly conduct talks while maintaining overt separation.  Suddenly, Democrats from both the Upper and Lower South were under tremendous pressure to take a stand in what many deemed a choice between polar alternatives of submission or a genuine party split.","            It was in this context that the debate began between <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>and <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>, both Democratic newspapers that usually agreed with each other.  The issue of location proved to be particularly important in their debate, as one may infer from the fact that their cities' hosted two of the three conventions in question.  The <em>Enquirer's</em> native state of Virginia was largely the head of the Upper South states who, at the time, were still members of the National Convention.  Furthermore, though the <em>Enquirer</em> itself was not usually so ambivalent, Virginia had a history of behavior that was at times unfaithful to the Deep South platform, especially in regards to slavery.  <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>, for its part, was a first-rate example of the South Carolinian persona-a zealous and unrepentant champion of slavery and the South; it was not afraid to say \"secession.\"","            The debate began in a May 10th article from the Charleston Mercury challenging <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>.  The <em>Mercury</em> wrote that the <em>Enquirer </em>should have rebuked their delegates for not withdrawing, and further criticized the <em>Enquirer's </em>proposal that the Richmond Convention should wait to act until after the Baltimore Convention.  The <em>Mercury</em> ridiculed this idea that would leave delegates with nothing to do but \"suck their fingers.\" On May 18th, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>had much to say in response.  First, it said that Virginia wanted to participate in the Richmond Convention, but that as it was, they and other likeminded states wouldn't be able to nominate delegates in time.  Next, the <em>Enquirer</em> said that the Southern delegates should participate in the Baltimore Convention.  It said that the temporary fracture of the party was likely enough to restore a majority that was supportive of Southern interests. At last, the <em>Enquirer</em> argued that the obdurate pursuance of the Richmond Convention's current course was not only dangerous to the Union, but also to the unity of border slave states with the Deep South.","            <em>The Charleston Mercury</em> rejoined with what would be the final words on the matter.  Immediately, the <em>Mercury</em> challenged the idea that other Southern states wouldn't have time to join.  Also, to the suggestion that the National Party would change its position, <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>replied that, \"the <em>Enquirer </em>may dismiss from its patriotic anxieties all such romantic anticipations.\"  Finally, the <em>Mercury</em> laid great emphasis on the discussion of Southern unity.  The <em>Mercury</em> defended sole participation in the Richmond Convention as better securing the interests of the South.  At the Baltimore Convention, some Southern delegates would invariably be tempted to compromise Southern interests and side with the Northern Democrats.   This claim, along with <em>The</em> <em>Richmond Enquirer's </em>final thoughts, penetrated the core of the debate, a struggle between identification foremost as a citizen of the South or of the Union-in a political climate wherein it seemed that one of them was bound to be overthrown."],"display_date":"May 10, 1860 - May 23, 1860","search_date":"1860-05-16","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4229,"title":"Charles William Truehearts Account of the Battle of the Crater:  Reconsidering Black and White\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-08-28","end_date":"1864-08-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            When the Civil War broke out, Texan Charles William Trueheart was at the University of Virginia studying medicine.  Despite initial reservations about secession, he joined the multitudes of southerners who rushed to enlist.  At first an artilleryman, by 1864 Trueheart had finished studying medicine and was an assistant surgeon in the 8th Alabama Infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was in this capacity that he experienced the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864 in Petersburg, Virginia.","            As Charles W. Trueheart recalled in an August 28, 1864 letter to his brother, Henry Trueheart, the level of death and destruction at the Crater was horrific.  He tells his brother, \"I have never any where seen such a slaughter as there was enacted,\" the dead and wounded were spread across several acres and, \"in many places you couldn't walk without stepping on their carcasses lying one two or even three deep.\"  The \"Crater\" was the result of an attempt by Union forces under Ambrose Burnside to smash the Confederacy's heavily fortified position at Petersburg by tunneling under their location and setting off a major explosion.  To this end, the Union effort was a success, but in the ensuing struggle, the Union attack lacked coordination and became log jammed at the Crater.  The Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee quickly capitalized on this error and inflicted a severe defeat on Burnside's forces, notably including the 4th Division of the United States Colored Troops.  For most Confederates at the Crater, this was their first encounter with black soldiers, here represented in major proportions.","            The black soldiers' presence was Charles Trueheart's main focus in recounting the aftermath of the battle.  His first mention was of the \"Negroes\" that lay dead and wounded with the \"Yankees[,] those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  Throughout the letter, Trueheart looked at the relationship of these two entities. He said that the injured blacks \"bore their sufferings much better than the Yankees;\" that they complained less and displayed greater Christian devotion in their sufferings.  Moreover, Trueheart wrote that the main complaints that the blacks had were that the Yankees abused them and that the slaves among them wanted to return to their masters.  Trueheart then described the heroism and ability of the blacks, almost equal to the Confederates' and far surpassing the behavior of the white Yankees.  He noted an instance wherein, \"one black fellow...had a regular duel with the Sergeant Major of our reg't.\"  Trueheart says that they traded several shots, that the black soldier, in fact, landed the first shot, hitting \"the Sgt. in the forehead.  Fortunately his head was as thick as his heart was brave, and the ball glanced upwards.\"  A Confederate at last shot and killed the black soldier.  In another notable encounter, an \"officer in our Brigade, having captured a negro in the trenches, told him to turn and fire upon the retreating Yankees; which he did rapidly.\"","            It is impossible to determine how much of Trueheart's account was true, but certainly there is a pervasive slant.  Indeed, many others reported with sadistic pleasure the widespread massacre of black troops by soldiers encouraged to execute them rather than take any prisoner.  The purpose of Truehearts' revisions seems almost inherent within the letter.  It reflected an interest, at the very least, in a temporary realignment of social inclusiveness that would incorporate blacks (40% of the Southern population) and thus engender support for the war efforts against \"those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  The value of blacks to the war effort was undeniable; loyalty of slaves on the plantations was a major issue, but their presence on the battlefield could be even more potent.  Around 200,000 black soldiers served in the Union, almost 25% of the number of men thought to have fought for the Confederacy-an especially impressive figure considering the comparatively small proportion of blacks in the Union, as well as their exclusion from enlistment until more than two years after the war began.  ","            By the Battle of the Crater in 1864, confidence in the ultimate success of the Confederacy was waning and there was considerable agitation for inclusion of blacks in the war effort.  Significantly, most supporters of a black soldiery also espoused emancipation, which they saw as an unfortunate but necessary accomplice.  By 1865, even top Confederate officials like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee came out in support of the plan. Yet the time had passed for such a move.  With the Confederate States' defeat in spring of 1865, it became a moot point.  The fragile wartime overture of Southern whites was rendered little more than a moment's retreat from racist agendas that defined much of the South's history."],"display_date":"August 28, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-28","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4267,"title":"Kate Stone Praises Booth for His Daring Attempt\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-28","end_date":"1865-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 28, 1865 Kate Stone recorded her thoughts about the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.

This incited fierce patriotism and nationalism within the South, as Confederates sought to define Kate Stone's \"terrible tragedy.\" To commemorate feelings of patriotism, military leaders, such as Robert E.

Looking at the South Carolina deeds of sell for 1820 to 1850 there is an indication that the circulation of slaves was very high. Several slaves who had a trade as a blacksmith, painter, mariner, or other essential profession were sold sometimes as often as twice a year. Slave women were also sold at this rate if they were accomplished cooks or seamstresses. Greenville County's slave holders would rotate these professionals based on demand throughout the region. Usually slaves were only mentioned in the sale by their first name. At this revolving rate, slaves coming through Greenville or the vagueness of the actual records of sold slaves makes it difficult to distinguish if Easter Hudson was a slave owned by a member of the Hudson family or a freed black in 1835.

This leads the question; did Easter Hudson participate in the Baptist Church as a slave? Was she forced to attend, because of her owner's wishes or did she attend on her own free will without the confines of her social situation? "," Brushy Creek Baptist Church recognized slaves as members of the church since its establishment in August 1805. The practice of white Southerners bringing their slaves to church was a very common one. The gallery in a church was especially designed to separate the races in a church. Evangelization was extremely important for southerners to rationalize slavery as an institution based on the paternalistic duties of \"civilizing\" the slave. Slave evangelization was promoted by slave owners, because the ministry of Christianity might, \"encouraged slaves to be more obedient and less prone to rebel against circumstances.\" ","Easter's mere existence in the church minutes is an example of the involvement of black members in a religious organization during the early nineteenth century.

Nat grew up very religious, and had the ability to read and write. Along with his education, his spirituality gave him a distinct view of the injustices of slavery taking place around him. Turner believed that he could lead a successful revolt, and in February of 1831 he executed his plan. Turner's original plan was to commence the insurrection on July fourth, but his plans abruptly changed due to a lunar eclipse on the 12th of February. \"On the appearance of the sign, I should arise and prepare myself, and slay my enemies with their own weapons.\"  The eclipse was viewed by Turner to be a sign from god telling him to start the rebellion. Nat Turner, accompanied by a few trusted fellow slaves entered their master's house killing the entire family. Their acts were brutal and merciless.  Recollecting the murders, Nat said, \"Will immediately killed Mrs. Turner, with one blow of his axe. I took Mrs. Newsome by the hand, and with the sword I had when I was apprehended, I struck her several blows over the head, but not being able to kill her, as the sword was dull, Will turned around, and discovering it, dispatched her also.\" Turner's rebel force, which amounted to about fifty strong, continued going house to house until White militia ended the insurrection.

Thomas Ruffin Grey was Turner's lawyer, and he published \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\" as a result of his time spent with Turner when he was in jail. ","    In the antebellum South slave rebellions and conspiracies tended to be extinguished, slaves still continued to resist. Nat Turner's rebellion along with many others raised a continuous concern of safety to the whites living in Virginia. Demographically, the slave population in Virginia was continuously growing, with large concentrations of slaves all over the state. Many whites feared that soon African-Americans would outnumber White slaveholders, making it difficult to keep surveillance over such a large population that could easily communicate. Economically, the plantation economy was deteriorating giving rise to more towns and cities. With the growth of towns and cities, economic gain was found in skilled artisanship, leading to the education of slaves in order for them to conduct such activity. Abolitionist pressure from the north also influenced the African-American community through propaganda and preaching by people sympathetic to emancipation. These factors brewed together produced a slave who was educated, in touch with other slaves, and fueled by the ideas of emancipation.

Batkin had been sold to a man in Tennessee, and he petitioned that state's court for his freedom.  The Circuit Court of Tennessee found that the original Virginia law under which Batkin had been enslaved was a violation of both the Bill of Rights of Virginia and the clause of the Constitution which prohibits bills of attainder, finding someone guilty without benefit of a trial.  Lundy concluded his article with a plea to his readers, urging them to action: \"How many poor wretches may yet be pining in slavery, who were as illegally doomed to that condition as was the ultimately more fortunate Batkin\" ","Lundy believed in limiting the expansion of slavery, but he also sought to establish a colony for freed slaves outside of the United States; he traveled to Mexico, Haiti and Canada looking for suitable sites. While his article was sympathetic to the plight of Batkin, his colinizationist views seem at odds with this abolitionist writing.  Lundy was an agent of the American Colonization Society and used his newspaper to promote its positions. He inspired other abolitionists, including William Lloyd Garrison who, prior to beginning his own newspaper, The Liberator, edited The Genius of Universal Emancipation while Lundy was abroad.  Garrison credited Lundy as \"awakening\" him to the abolitionist cause.

Included in Manly's offenses was the prayer at Jefferson Davis' inauguration to the presidency of the confederacy in February 1861.  As part of a special group of ex-confederates who could not sign the typical oath of allegiance, Manly needed a Presidential pardon.  Individuals like Manly had to submit a petition to Andrew Johnson to be pardoned.  Following the petition, Manly had to obey five terms to become and remain a United States citizen.  First, he took the oath of allegiance as established by President Johnson on May 29, 1865.  Manly then had to pay any costs owed from any proceeding and disclaim property or proceeds from the sale of confiscated property.  He was instructed to notify the secretary of state to legitimize the pardon upon its arrival, and if Manly used slave labor of any kind in the future, the pardon would be void.  On October 19, 1865 Manly received two more official letters signed by Secretary of State William H. Seward: the first stated that he had taken the oath of loyalty, and the second professed the first letter was a valid copy of the letter Seward had on his file.  At age 67, just three years before his death, Manly Basil, Sr. was once again a citizen of the United States.","            At the end of the Civil War, Lincoln (and later Johnson) was faced with the task of reintegrating those who had participated in the rebellion against the United States.  Lincoln designed a plan that included an oath of allegiance readily available to the masses, but required leaders of the Confederacy to ask him for a pardon directly.  By not forcing anyone to take the oath, Lincoln encouraged a feeling of amnesty when the war ended.   After Lincoln's death Johnson adopted a similar plan, but included a greater number of people in the \"exceptions\" who must ask for presidential pardon.  Manly's role in establishing the confederacy meant that he fell within the fourteen categories of exceptions which included those rebels who had served in political office, held a high ranking military position, or owned property valued at over twenty thousand dollars.  With so many people requiring special consideration, there was a significant influx of petitions for pardon between July and October of 1865 from those who wanted to attend the upcoming state conventions.  Basil Manly's petition for pardon coincided with press reports claiming President Johnson was giving pardons more freely than before.  Lincoln's hope of rebuilding the nation by granting citizenship to large numbers of ex-confederates set up an interesting dichotomy.  While Radical Republicans grew increasingly angry at Johnson's laxness on those they saw as traitors, Southern Democrats slowly began fighting to reassume power in the South.  Instead of finding a unified nation, the two factions continued the struggle for power until after Reconstruction ended."],"display_date":"September 12, 1865 - October 19, 1865","search_date":"1865-09-30","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4337,"title":"All She Wanted Was Elbow Room\n","course_id":3,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-07-10","end_date":"1861-07-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"All She Wanted Was Elbow Room\" was published in <em>The Rushlight, </em>a student literary magazine of Wheaton Female Seminary in Norton Massachusetts in 1861. The main characters Fannie North and Nancy South had extremely different views but the one characteristic they shared was their desire for change. The external image of two girls represented the divisive issue of slavery opinions in the north. Fannie North lived in a small cottage and longed for \"a larger and freer home\" in which to grow and be independent. Nancy South had plenty of room and the finest of all material goods, but she was always seeking more. Nancy was not content with her blessings and fortunes. Rather she chose to conquer land and impose her force on others. While \"quiet little Fannie North was [...] contenting herself faithfully living in her narrow sphere, till God should see fit to grant her more room, big Nancy South spread out broader than ever,\"  the desire for more room in which to expand herself only contributed to her selfishness. Fannie was saddened by her lack of freedom and wanted nothing more than to help herself and others enjoy free will. Her counterpart was unsympathetic and self-interested, wanting only what benefited her. The story ended with reassurance that \"Nancy's mansion is large and high, but on a sandy foundation\", her power was diminishing day by day. ","Opinions ran rampant during the Civil War which began in April of the publication year. Many northerners felt strongly that slavery was immoral and must be condemned. The portrayal of southerners as guided by financial and material gains rather than values began appearing in literature and propaganda. Carl Osthaus commented on southern deviance by saying they were all \"shiftlessness and exploitation was the rule to follow\". He believed this was why they failed to see the human side of slavery.  The <em>Rushlight</em> article articulates these images by creating Nancy South to be one-dimensional, \"elbow room to her would have been no blessing, unless obtained at somebody else's expense\".

In fact, some of the greatest advancements made by mankind in fields ranging from medicine to the arts can trace their roots to military necessity. One such example made in the field of Civil Rights during the American Civil War was Special Field Orders Number 15, popularly referred to as \"Forty Acres and a Mule.\" Issued by General William T. Sherman shortly after the end of his infamous March to the Sea, the act placed captured Southern land in the hands of the freed slaves, something that had never been done before. ","The fall of the seaport city of Savannah, Georgia in late 1844 to Union General William T. Sherman brought an end to the general's famous \"March to the Sea.\" Over a period of two months, a fifty-mile wide front of Union soldiers had marched up to 12 miles a day, looting what they wanted and destroying everything else, including the metaphorical chains of untold numbers of slaves. Under the Emancipation Proclamation, all slaves in areas controlled by the Union were granted freedom, which would pose an unforeseen problem in this case. Specifically, Abraham Lincoln had drafted the Proclamation at the North's nadir, when obtaining half as much land and slaves in twice the amount of time as Sherman had just done would have seemed impossible. As such, the Proclamation's wording about what to do with freed slaves was much too vague. Thus, having no way to support themselves, many of the new freedmen attached themselves to Sherman's army.","On January 16th, 1865, Sherman, with the blessing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, attempted to solve this problem with the passage of Special Field Orders No. 15. With the powers granted to him by the War, Sherman confiscated over thirty miles worth of plantations and islands from slaveholders and, taking a page from the 1862 Homestead Act, turned them over to the slaves for use as free settlements. It is interesting to note that while Order 15 is very explicit on such major rules and regulations as the maximum amount of land a single family could own (40 acres), it is remarkably silent on things that deal more with the day-to-day events of the settlement. To be sure, this would be in keeping with the Order's restriction of government interference with the settlement to protection and aid in setting up said settlement.","  Despite this, the Order itself unmistakably struck more of a blow against the CSA military and strategy than for Civil Rights. For starters, although the Order explicitly prohibited conscripting troops from the new settlements, it was no less explicit when it stated that all \"young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist.\" Additionally, the Order effectively turned a great mass of dead weight on Sherman's army into something of an occupation force. In this case, one that would produce rather than just occupy or be refugees and free up veteran soldiers for the coming months of war. On a final note, it is interesting to point out that Section III of the Order contains a line that could be interpreted as preparing for Reconstruction. Specifically, the Order states that Congress has the power to \"regulate\" the titles of the freedmen, effectively laying the ground for a transfer of power when the martial law that created the settlements was rendered null. The legal ramifications of transferring power from military to civilian hands are more complex than many realize, and in giving Congress some authority, Sherman no doubt eased this transfer. Unfortunately, the old maxim that laws are silent in times of war is a door that works both ways, in that the noticed laws of war may be silent in times of peace. In this case, during Reconstruction, much of Sherman's Land Grant properties reverted back to their Antebellum title holders.

Colonization, as the name implies, had the goal of colonizing slaves in Africa in a country called Liberia. As such, there were numerous attempts to convince Africans to willingly emigrate. One pamphlet seeking to do this was entitled \"Address to Free People of Color of the State of Maryland,\" as printed by John D. Toy in 1859. Toy opened by providing a brief summary of his life, saying that he had spent many years traveling, often in the company of Africans, who had shown him much kindness. Following this, he informed his audience of all the political and social rights that they will never gain if they stay in the United States, and tells them they have two options: continue on like this pointlessly, or flee the country. ","After that had been established, the pamphlet starts to sound like the sales pitch it is with the declaration \"Go to Liberia,\" for only there would the black race be free. To be sure, this passage is one of the few unexaggerated claims in the entire pamphlet. The assumption by Toy that race prejudice would hamper the lives of free blacks in the future was well-founded One can see evidence of the kind of racial pseudo-science that had given the European powers the pretext to colonize Liberia in the first place.  Toy reminds his readers that there are three basic kinds of climates in the world, with the black race being best suited for the tropics, in which Liberia is located. Elaborating on this, he describes Liberia as a land of perpetual perfect summer days. Specifically, he says that even though it seldom rains, there is an abundance of green vegetation under a sun that is \"not too hot.\" ","As would be expected of any sales pitch, this pamphlet exaggerates. All in all, Toy makes Liberia sound like Eden itself, down to an abundance of trees with valuable lumber. As for water, there are apparently so many good rivers that \"no one ever suffers even inconvenience from want of good water in Liberia.\" Regarding crops, Toy says that lima beans grow so well in Liberia that little work yields a good harvest and there is so much palm oil that in a few years Liberia will make more money off palm oil than Maryland makes off tobacco. Even today Liberia is \"richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture.\"","As for government, the author states that the government of Liberia has been recognized by many of the Great Powers, with whom they share good trading relations. He also says (as our Founders would put it) that the Liberian government is run by Africans, for Africans. Later on, he states that this will forever be the case because of \"African Fever,\" a malady deadly to whites that blacks are naturally immune to (again showing use of racial pseudo-sciences). Prior to this, however, he tells his readers that the government of Maryland will gladly pay for their passage across the Atlantic. Here we can see just how desperate even the Northern public was to get rid of the Africans. After all, few governments of any era are willing to pay for anything (especially anything expensive) when there is little profit expected in return. Of course, this claim may be another one of the actual truths in this pamphlet. As modern sources report, colonization was \"a costly affair, and the [American Colonization] Society's founders strongly believed that any colony...would have greater viability if it [was paid for] by the United States Government.\"  ","Toy ended his pamphlet by anticipating and answering any negative stories his audience may have heard about Liberia. That answer: in a word, homesickness. He then goes on to add that within a few years people that are homesick will wonder why they ever stayed in Maryland. Finally, the author closes by praising Liberia's infrastructure, asserting that it has fine schools, mechanics, doctors, etc.  "],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":5931,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4362,"title":"Reverend McGill Offers His Religious Views on Slavery\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Alexander T. McGill believed very strongly in the 1860s that slavery should be abolished because it \"degrades and destroys the children of men.\"","Slavery needed to be abolished immediately, but slaves needed to be educated first, because, \"neither slavery perpetuated, for its own sake, nor slavery abolished before its subjects are educated for freedom will comport with the determination of God our maker.\" He also believed, as did many other people at the time, that African Americans were an inferior race, and allowing freed slaves to stay in America would be a disaster. Blacks and whites were opposite races which could never coexist. McGill used Mexico as an example of what could have happened if the freed slaves were allowed to stay in America. After all races were made free and equal in Mexico, \"amalgamation advances, degradation deepens; anarchy prevails; laws, constitutions, and the ballot box are a mockery.\""," The only possible way the slaves could be freed without greatly harming the country, according to McGill, would be to send freed slaves to Liberia, to return to the home of their fathers, which McGill claimed was determined by God. Sending the freed slaves to Liberia was thought by some as a \"New Testament Exodus\", mirroring the Old Testament Exodus in which the Israelites were sent out of Egypt.  McGill wrote that by doing this, the freed slaves would gain a Christianity better than white men could ever hope to have, and were doing a wonderful thing for Africa, which desperately needed the freed slaves to come home. It would have also benefited America financially because it would only be about half the cost of the war.","Many religious institutions held these beliefs, though not all. Some churches wanted the slaves to be freed and kept in the country, while others were not against slavery at all and felt that it was their God-given right to have slaves, and felt completely justified about doing it.

Slaves in North Carolina worked hard growing tobacco and other crops. They generated great wealth for the slave holders, but they did not earn anything in return, and they had no legal rights. The government banned the slaves' importation in North Carolina in part to protect slaves' value, and it was a sign of North Carolina's opposition to the slave trade.","The government of North Carolina did what it could to prohibit the importation of slaves into the state, banning the importation of foreign slaves in 1786.  Moreover, under a state law passed in 1816, any person who brought foreign slaves into the state of North Carolina, in opposition to Congress's ban on the transatlantic slave trade, would forfeit their slave property. The state would then sell the slaves and keep the profits from the sale. These strict regulations made sure citizens did not buy slaves from any other parts of world.","North Carolina, New York, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Connecticut, and Rhode Island all prohibited the importation of slaves before 1800. Prohibiting the importation of slaves was also a very important event for the American Congress, and in 1808, as soon as allowed under the U.S. Constitution, Congress agreed to forbid the importation of slaves without opposition. \"In 1819, Congress declared the slave-trade to be piracy, though,\" according to historian Hubert H. Bancroft, \"none of its participants seem to have been condemned as pirates.\" Furthermore, the declaration was not only for a particular state, but was a national declaration for all the states of America. The declaration was necessary in that time, because the slave holders living in the Southern part of the country realized that slave trade might cause an explosion in the slaves' population, and they were afraid that slaves would fight against them for freedom. Furthermore, they had enough slaves to produce children, who were the potential slaves of the future, so they did not need extra slaves.

The <em>Franklin Repository </em>of April 27, 1859 contains a summary of the April 13th anti-Buchanan speech made by the Honorable John Hickman at the Independent Democratic Convention at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Hickman was outraged at the conduct of President Buchanan which he believed had violated the Constitution of the United Sates - particularly in relation to the issues of slavery and popular sovereignty.  \"Suddenly,\" said Hickman, in order to carry the election in his home state of Missouri, \"he became transformed from the sympathizer with down trodden freedom, to the open and shameless defender of aggressive and law defying slavery.\" There is \"an eternal antagonism between <em>freedom</em> and <em>slavery\", </em>said Hickman. Buchanan, according to Hickman, exceeded the powers granted to him as President by the Constitution by usurping powers of Congress. His policies had driven the country to the point of insolvency by not providing for proper supervision of the country's finances. Public property, Hickman contended, sold for less than its value and high wages were paid to workers who do nothing because they are friends or supporters of Buchanan. The Post Office had been poorly managed and also the victim of patronage. As a result of their own policies, said Hickman, the administration had become unable to act they are so afraid. Hickman next attacked the advisability of the acquisition of Cuba particularly in light of the fact that it will add to the strength of the slave states. Finally, he made a call to stand up against the wrongs of the administration, to defend the Union and fight against slavery.","Buchanan was well aware the Union was in jeopardy but wanted desperately to preserve the status quo.

This was an important event because the international slave trade had been considered piracy but had not been prosecuted due to the existence of slavery in the United States. Now, however, the Lincoln administration changed all that with the first execution by hanging of one of the most notorious and successful of all of the slave traders.","Gordon, a native of Maine, had been engaged in the slave trade for many years. On August 8, 1860 off the West Coast of Africa his ship stopped and was boarded by Lieutenant Henry D. Todd, U.S.N. of the United States steamer <em>Mohican</em>. When Lieutenant Todd boarded the ship which was flying the American flag he was horrified by both the sight and smell of what he saw.  On board, he found eight hundred and ninety-seven men, women and children. They ranged in age from six months to forty years; half were children and the other half, one quarter men and one quarter women. They were so crowded together he could not move without stepping on someone. The smell was so foul as to be sickening. Disease ran rampant. Twenty-nine had died and been thrown overboard.","The sailors claimed that they had been told this was a legitimate voyage or they would have never signed on. They also said that it was obvious that Gordon was the Captain. Gordon eventually admitted to them that the <em>Erie</em> was a slave ship and they were told they would receive one dollar for each slave who arrived safely at their destination.","Gordon was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. All attempts to have him pardoned were unsuccessful and he was scheduled to be hanged. The night before, he somehow managed to come into the possession of a poison, probably strychnine, and attempted to commit suicide rather than face the hangman's noose. Unfortunately for him, his attempt was thwarted by the efforts of physicians who pumped his stomach and saved his life. ","Gordon's last request was that they cut a lock of his hair and send it to his wife along with a ring he removed from his finger. Gordon was given rather large amounts of whiskey to keep him alive for the execution and so he was not sober when he went to his fate.

This slave then \"found his way\", in a manner unclear, back to St. Louis and there sued for his freedom, on the grounds that Illinois was a free state. The circuit court found against him, but he continued with his case all the way to the Missouri Supreme Court, \"where although two out of the three Judges were advocates of slavery, the decision was reversed and it was unanimously decided that he was a freeman.\" This slave most likely used an 1824 Missouri state law that stated, \"That it shall be lawful for any person held in slavery to petition the circuit court...\".

The \"once free, always free\" argument was frequently used to the great benefit of enslaved blacks, in many cases leading to their freedom. This legal precedent was overturned in the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held both that slaves had no right to petition the court as they were not citizens and that to give a slave his freedom would be to deprive the owner of his property illegally."],"display_date":1827,"search_date":"1827-07-02","locations":[{"id":7914,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4432,"title":"Legend of the Lafitte Brothers at 941 Bourbon Street \n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1810-01-01","end_date":"1823-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Once upon a time, two pirate brothers lived in the cottage at 941 Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana. Although it may seem outlandish, the strength of this local legend about the Lafitte brothers, Pierre and Jean, persists to this day. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings, as well as The National Historic Landmarks Program, describe the structure on Bourbon Street as being built by the Lafittes between 1772 and 1791. Both sources claim that the brothers used the building to front a blacksmith shop to cover their reprehensible dealings in pirating and slavery."," The cottage at 941 Bourbon Street is a historical building in itself. It is located at the intersection of Bourbon and Saint Philip Street. This section of New Orleans is known as the French Quarter or Vieux Carre. The streets forming the Vieux Carre, or the old square, are the original streets of the city. William C. Davis explains that the names are \"redolent of [the] French and Spanish History.\" Historians acknowledge that this area prospered during the time of the Lafittes. Furthermore, the structure of the cottage is very emblematic of the French Colonial architectural style of the time period. The cottage is constructed with timbers of cypress, soft brick, and plaster. According to the historian Liliane Crete, the fact that the wood is cypress illustrates that \"the lowland of Louisiana was entirely covered with cypresses.\"","While 941 Bourbon Street is important because of its preservation of a historic style and time period, it is the brothers associated with it that solidify its historical importance and legendary quality. Many stories exist that tell of the Lafitte's blacksmith shop located on Bourbon Street and Saint Philip Street and the affairs, adventures, and trials of the brothers. The Lafitte brothers are very important to the history of New Orleans, particularly the slave trade. Many people in Louisiana wanted slaves, but several situations limited the supply, such as the embargo on importation of Africans into the United States. The Lafittes exploited the situation in order to become wealthy by providing slaves through illicit dealings when no one else could. They also became involved in many scandals and political situations.","Although legends, myths and other sources believe that the Lafittes lived or worked in the building, others argue the association. The author Barbara SoRelle Bacot believes, \"[941 Bourbon Street] is romantically known as Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, but it has nothing to do with Lafitte or any blacksmith.\"  She attributes the association to the nineteenth century writer George Washington Cable. Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence for either side, whether the Lafitte brothers truly built the structure is not what is important. 941 Bourbon Street is enlivened by the local legends of Pierre and Jean Lafitte and in turn has immortalized their legends in the region."],"display_date":"1810 - 1823","search_date":"1816-12-31","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4657,"title":"Visit to Slave Jail","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"1843-11-08","end_date":"1843-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 8, 1843, a reporter from the <em>Philadelphia Enquirer </em>described his visit to a slave jail. Outraged by the horrific conditions he decried “the wickedness and the cruelty of the abominable system…”   In his article the reporter describes the conditions of the jail and the different types of slaves who were being housed in the jail. The proprietor of the jail “was continually occupied in telling how comfortable and happy they were- how much enjoyment they derived from jumping, dancing, fiddling, gallanting and frequently remarked that they enjoyed more happiness than he or we did”. The proprietor insisted that the slave prisoners’ situation was not at all harsh but rather more pleasant that most jails, but upon inspection of the jail the reporter discovered that there was more to the jail and the slave prisoners under the surface. The proprietor was counting on this young slave’s act as a diversion based on the belief that “as outcast in a white dominated society, blacks alternately were portrayed as feeble-willed noble savages, comically musical minstrel figures, and dehumanized brutes”.","In one apartment of the jail there was a young slave by the name of Jim Crow Jr. who was who was forced by the jail proprietor to “ jump jim crow”. The reporter felt that “it was evidently done to draw our attention from a contemplation of the real situation of these unhappy beings”. In the next jail there was a mulatto young female slave that was suing for her freedom. What was interesting about her case was that she was so fair or light-skinned that she could easily pass for white. The reporter had the most sympathy for her by saying “my eyes filled with tears, and gladly would I have made almost any sacrifice, could I have released her from that gloomy prison”.","Before leaving the jail the reported thought about purchasing all the slaves from the jail, but the price was well out of his reach.

D. Dewey wrote to Reverend W. M'Kenney from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, he reflected upon his observations from the African colony he had just visited. The letter he produced in June 1825 portrayed sentiments expressed throughout the nation at the time on African colonization. He described the colony of Haiti in the most positive light, depicting the colony as a haven of liberties for freed blacks that were shipped there from the U.S. As he wrote to M'Kenney, he stated that the new members of the Haiti colony emanated \"…intelligence, manliness, and capacities for the various business of life, such as you never see among the colored people of this country.\" Dewey wrote of the improved everyday life of the freed blacks in Haiti, where they could exercise and enjoy the respect of their freedoms and their independence. He asserted that the Haitian populations were given many more liberties than under the American government and allowing freed blacks to take advantage of these freedoms was the only moral thing to do in order to better the lives of the previously enslaved. He reflected on how the American government had held slaves in \"the grossest ignorance\" and deprived them of their right to education, while in Haiti the newly freed African Americans could practice these rights without restraint. Dewey also concluded that, through the establishment of religion, the American public could rest assured that the freed slaves would be a humane and grateful population.","            With the formation of the American Colonization Society in 1816, the movement to colonize freed blacks outside the U.S gained a fast-paced momentum. At the time of Dewey's letter, the ACS portrayed itself as a conservative, antislavery organization that worked for the emancipation of slaves. The ACS insisted that the colonization of African Americans would Christianize the race and make them more humane, expand international trade, and end the slave trade. Many U.S citizens during 1825 believed the claims of the ACS, as shown in Dewey's letter, that the new colonies would create better environments for the freed blacks and that the colonization of these peoples was a moral practice. However, the true sentiments of the ACS and the large amount of support it gained can be traced back to another reason contrary to the betterment of blacks; Negrophobia. The fear of freed blacks' gaining rights in the United States caused many whites to embrace the ACS. Despite ACS claims of trying to promote emancipation, the society merely reinforced the ideology that African Americans would always be inferior to whites and therefore they would be better off in colonies either in Africa or the Caribbean. While the ACS had expected support from African Americans, they were largely mistaken. Shortly after the ACS was founded, 3,000 blacks convened in Philadelphia and unanimously voted in opposition to the Society. Between 1820 and 1823, sixty freed blacks moved to Africa from Pennsylvania. By 1825, one-third of them had died, and nearly half of the survivors had fled the colony. Those who had moved to Liberia, one of the African colonies, had suffered the largest mortality rate that had ever been reliably recorded at the time and only had experiences filled with misery, poverty and disease. Reverend Dewey's letter clearly showed how supporters of the ACS depicted the colonization movement as a positive, enlightening campaign in order to gain support from the white American population; however, in actuality, the ACS harbored negative, racist motives."],"display_date":"June 1825","search_date":"1825-06-15","locations":[{"id":5928,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4515,"title":"The Pain of Slavery","course_id":20,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-09-12","end_date":"1816-09-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A forty-five year old man by the name of Benjamin Powell walked into a foreign town from his former existence of Indian slavery.

Religious groups expressed their sentiments in publication including the Christian Register, which published an article in an issued dated September 3, 1825. The article argued for the transportation of slaves to their homeland in Liberia because it would be beneficial to the discriminated African American race for a plethora of reasons. The publication argued slaves would regain freedoms denied to them in America as well as allow them to establish their own government the way they desired. Freed slaves would be allowed to cultivate the land of Liberia by utilizing certain technology the United States would introduce to the country. Colonization societies believed light American presence would allow former slaves to excel in the agricultural, economic and political realms of their society because freed slaves in Liberia would have ties with one of the most technologically advanced nations of the era. The Christian Register boldly emphasized the emancipation of enslaved peoples as morally correct, and a resolution was desperately needed to appease slaveholders and abolitionists alike. Sending slaves to Liberia seemed to offer the best mode of compromise.","    The issue of whether the emancipation of enslaved African Americans was necessary during the nineteenth century played a crucial role in the development of beliefs in certain groups, such as the American Colonization Society and the Pennsylvania Colonization Society. The American Colonization Society, the Pennsylvania Colonization Society, and the Christian Register advocated that the sending of freed slaves would be beneficial to enslaved African Americans. However, after reanalyzing the efforts of pro-colonization societies and publication, historians of the 21st century have come to understand that colonization was in response to the threat of freed African Americans if emancipation legislation was passed in the United States. Abolitionists offered information, which discredited the efforts of colonization societies by arguing reports from Liberia were deplorable. Slaves were rarely sent to their homeland and conditions in Liberia were treacherous. There was no possible way freed slaves could colonize Liberia the way pro-colonization supports had argued they could in the nineteenth century. Abolitionists were capable of discrediting the ideologies of colonization societies because it was based on the belief of negrophobia.

David Wilmot, a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania at the time, added a proposal of how to settle the slavery question once and for all, known as the Wilmot Proviso. The proviso called for an end to slavery in any new states admitted to the Union. In 1848, the people elected Whig Zachary Taylor for president over Democratic contender Lewis Cass. So how did President Taylor really feel about the proviso?","    An excerpted news source in Augusta, Georgia, reported that some Democratic papers had published a letter said to be written by General Taylor in the Spring of 1847 regarding the proviso. The contents included in the 1848 pamphlet state that the letter was susceptible of a construction that would make General Taylor seem to favor that doctrine. That letter was later proven to be false and possibly fabricated, as the editor who received the letter and interpreted it to mean that President Taylor would favor the Wilmot Proviso had abandoned the issue, and General Taylor with it. This sampled article is one of several pieces in a anonymously published pamphlet from 1848 that look at whether Taylor actually believed that Congress had the constitutional power to settle the slavery question with the Wilmot Proviso. ","    Scholarship from 2006 suggests a split between the Northern and Southern Whigs on Taylor's intentions. James Brewer Stewart, Professor of History at Macalester College, argues that in 1848, the Southern Whigs claimed Taylor despised the Wilmot Proviso and if elected, he would successfully oppose it; yet Northern Whigs guaranteed that the moment that Congress passed the Proviso, Taylor would sign it.","    Towards the end of the pamphlet, the anonymous author found direct testimony of Taylor's opposition to the Wilmot Proviso through strained readings and comparisons. The language found from an exchange between southern statesman Joseph Segar and Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise in Hampton, Virginia stated that Taylor would exercise the veto on any bill containing the provisions of the Wilmot Proviso. Historian Holman Hamilton also adds that Taylor and Cass occupied the same ground, that the Proviso should not be adopted.

In the article, Douglas defended his opinions on the much derided and disputed issue of popular sovereignty.","He explained his interpretation of popular sovereignty with two basic arguments.  First, he contended that the position of the people of the territories, in regards to the issue of slavery, was similar to the position of the colonies under British rule, who were denied the right to stop the importation of slaves.  As an example, he described a letter sent to the King of England in 1772 citing a clause in the Virginia Constitution adopted in June, 1776, claiming as justification for Independence, \"the inhuman use of the Royal negative in refusing us [the Colony of Virginia] permission to exclude slavery from us by law\" (Douglas' brackets)","His second argument justified both Congress's role in the territories and the ability of a territorial government to decide the issue of slavery.  To accomplish this, Douglas referred to the clause in the Constitution which gave Congress the power to \"make all rules and regulations respecting the territory,\" of the United States.  This gave Congress the power to appoint a territorial government, as in Kansas and Nebraska, which would regulate the slavery issue on the basis of popular sovereignty.  Douglas also claimed that the founders often referred to the territory as \"States\" or \"new States.\"  Thus, if the territories are considered to be \"States\" or \"new States,\" then they, like any of the states, have the power to permit or deny slavery in their territory.","Douglas published the article in <em>Harpers Magazine</em> after a tumultuous decade of sectional bickering over the issue of slavery, in which he was personally responsible for the violently controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854).  According to historian James McPherson, Douglas' \"parliamentary legerdemain pushed the bill through the Senate,\" despite strong free-state Democrat and Whig opposition.  The bill permanently tied Douglas' name to the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which Douglas dubbed, according to Nicole Etcheson, the \"great principle of self-government.\" The Kansas territory was the proving ground for Douglas' pet project, and when, according to McPherson, the situation there began to deteriorate, Douglas' attachment to popular sovereignty became a political liability.","With this in mind, according to historian Robert Johannsen, Senators Albert G. Brown and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and James S. Green of Missouri confronted Douglas in 1859 and urged him to defend his controversial doctrine.  Brown demanded clarification because Douglas \"was emerging as the strongest contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1860.\"","A fierce defender of the doctrine, Douglas shall always be remembered for what he said, as quoted by historian Eric Dean, of popular sovereignty, \"I will follow that principle wherever its logical consequences may take me and I will endeavor to defend it against assault from any and all quarters.\""],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":15199,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"UNORGANIZED TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4463,"title":"Abolitionist Flogged for Allegedly Selling Pamphlets\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-08-03","end_date":"1833-08-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Amos Dresser, a student at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, left  the college after a ban on an anti-slavery society and traveled through the upper south  selling bibles.

According to Dresser, \"This added considerably to the general excitement, which I afterwards learned, was prevailing in relation to slavery--and in a short time it was noised about that I had been 'circulating incendiary periodicals among the free colored people, and trying to excite the slaves to insurrection.'\"","            On the evening of August 8, Constable John Braughton brought Dresser into custody where an impromptu Committee of Vigilance convened at the courthouse to try Dresser for violating the non-existent law of possessing anti-slavery material. During the convention, the committee resolved unanimously to search Dresser's trunk, finding antislavery publications. Dresser stated \"These, I informed the Committee, I had put in my trunk for my own perusal, as I wished to compare what had been written with the result of my own observation while in the slave states, and that no individual had seen them besides myself.\" After the reading of the letters, Dresser claims that \"Great stress was laid on these extracts, and I was questioned very minutely...\" and that \"They labored much to prove I was sent out by some society, and that I was, under the guise of a religious mission, performing the odious office of an insurrectionary agent.\"","            When the committee withdrew to deliberate on the case, Dresser recalled having no anxiety: \"There was no law forbidding what I had done...my intentions had been those of kindness to all--I had no secret feelings of guilt, arraigning me before the bar of my conscience, for any mean or clandestine movement.\" After reaching a decision, the committee found Dresser guilty of being a member of an anti-slavery society and of possessing periodicals published by the American Anti-Slavery Society.

In his speech, Everett discussed the reasons for the ACS, such as stopping the slave trade, and discusses their inspirations which include the spread of Christianity and American ideals.","Historian Irving H. Bartlett regarded Everett as \"conventional among Americans outside of the South\" in his views on slavery.  He knew that slavery was an \"unfortunate institution,\" but that it was protected by the Constitution.  This made Everett a relatively neutral party in assessing the accomplishments of the ACS.  Everett showed that the ACS had succeeded in its original goal which was to stop the slave trade.  He said that many other civilizations had attempted to stop the trade, but the ACS had actually done it by giving slaves that were on captured slave ships a place to settle and possibly assist them in finding their original homes. ","He later talked about the many reasons civilizing Africa had been a failure and why the ACS would correct this failure with their plans.  Everett believed that the white man could not civilize Africa because disease and cultural and environmental differences in Africa would not allow it. He went on to say that with all of the natural endowments of Africa, it had to be civilized because it was a waste of such a fertile continent. The argument of many of the critics of the ACS was that Africans were too inferior to Europeans to be civilized.  Everett said that this was not entirely true, and cited the example of the Egyptians and of many intelligent Africans who had been given appropriate education. Everett argued that if the lower classes of white men were compared with the African race then the superiority of whites may not be so apparent.  He compared the accomplishments in Liberia by the colony set up by the ACS to that of the first colonies in America such as Jamestown and Plymouth.  In Liberia they had already established a Constitution of organized republican government, courts, schools, communication to the interior, agriculture, and most importantly churches.  These accomplishments outstripped those by the first colonies of America in their first twenty-five years.","One of the main arguments by Everett was that Christianity guided the Africans into civilization and by the African Americans teaching the natives Christianity all will be civilized.

People who were against William Henry's arrest threw stones at the police office in which Henry was held and at nine o'clock at night, the suspect slave was freed and helped in his escape to Canada.

Because he captured Henry in compliance with the Fugitive Slave Act, the trial focused on enforcing of the Fugitive Slave Act and the case was brought to the New York Supreme Court. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 protected Henry W. Allen from his alleged kidnapping and he was found to be \"Not Guilty\" by the court. The reason for the upheaval in Syracuse stranded from the act's unpopularity in the Northern states because it was believed to appease slave-holding states."," Violence in response to the Fugitive Slave Act was not uncommon.

Rice, water casks, and cooking utensils were shipped on board of the vessel.  The only problem was that having rice, cooking utensils, and water casks together on board the vessel could be considered \"conclusive evidence of an intention on the part of the master or owner to employ the vessel in transporting Negroes from Africa to be sold as slaves.\"  Because of this, they had to sneak the water casks on board somewhere quiet, usually at the latest time possible before departure.  \"Nineteen vessels out of every twenty fitted out in the United States for this illegal traffic on the coast of Africa, manage to evade the law,\" one newspaper editor observed.  After having left port safely, the vessel had nothing to fear because British ships believed the United States government would not allow slave ships to sail under an American flag.  Once the vessel had reached Africa, it would \"run into one of the numerous river arms that characterized the African coast.\"  These river arms offered great places to load the slaves without attracting attention, and slavers could choose when they felt the best time of departure would be.

The fitting out of slavers became a prosperous business in the United States, one centered in New York City.  Vessels leaving New York were in close alliance with legitimate trade.  Downtown merchants of wealth and respectability engaged in buying and selling African slaves throughout the 1850s with little interference from the government.  \"During eighteen months of the years 1859-1860 eighty-five slavers were reported to have been fitted out in New York harbor, and these alone transported from 30,000 to 60,000 slaves annually,\" wrote historian W.E.B. Dubois.  \"The United States deputy marshal of that district declared in 1856 that the business of fitting out slavers was never prosecuted with greater energy than at present.\"  Because there were few United States war-ships in Brazil, American smugglers easily ran in cargoes, in spite of the prohibitory law.  Ships often used the flag of the United States to conceal acts of piracy.  When Brazil's trade declined, Cuba's trade greatly increased, and the illegal trading continued until British enforcement and further diplomacy finally ended the Atlantic trade in the 1860s.

There was a constant demand for slaves because they were vital to the stability of their individual plantations. \"Slavery shaped the economic growth of the lower South in the eighteenth century \" (Rosenbloom 1999). These individual slaves were not looked at as important figures, but what was essentially important to their owners was what they got out of them. Their labor was cheap, but what they produced was expensive. Therefore, the slave owner was making a complete profit through the purchase of a slave or slaves. \"If eight vessels were fitted out for this purpose, and but a single one escaped the vigilance of the cruisers, the profit accruing from the sale of her cargo would more than counterbalance the loss sustained in the capture of the remaining seven\". This quote explains the risk/reward factor that is related to the slave trade. A slave's dedication to the plantation can produce such a great profit over time. This economic factor leaves little doubt as to why a landowner would want slaves.","Nowadays the buying and selling of slaves is looked at in the right moral context. However, in the centuries even before the founding of America slavery was viewed as a way to achieve economic proliferation. This was seen by acquiring land to grow cotton in warm southern climates such as Florida. Feelings and rights were not accounted for when talking about slavery. What mattered most was that the slaves were delivered in the right quantity to their prospective owners. Africans were treated as a possession like any other object that was traded for at the time. However, possessing a slave at the time guaranteed a turnover rate in the favor of the owner. This concept began to spread throughout the country as owners battled for the possession of hard working and dedicated slaves. Society became dependant on the goods that slaves produced consequently demanding more land, which in turn meant more slaves. These slaves would be found through the network of trade from Africa and the Caribbean. Without this vast system of trade that brought about thousands upon thousands of slaves, plantations would have died out resulting in an economic failure."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":1319,"lat":25.7665375474,"lng":-80.1467565312,"zoom":8,"place":"DADE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":157,"tag":"Transatlantic Slave Trade"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":" Culture, Power, and Society","school":"Rollins College","course_id":21,"school_id":5}},{"id":4579,"title":"Slave Rebellion","course_id":21,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1838-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Slave rebellions were common in the south during the 19th century, as those held in bondage began to fight back against their oppressors.

He maintained that, once freed from their slave ties, \"negroes\" only fell back upon their tendency to idleness, returned to the \"savagism of their African ancestors,\" and converted back to their \"heathen\" way of life. Van Evrie used statistical elements to show that the abolition of slavery in islands such as Jamaica and Haiti resulted in the ruin of their economy and trade, the return to uncultivated wilderness of the lands, and the \"desolation\" of the plantations installed by the colonist countries.  ","For Van Evrie, \"freed negroes,\" as \"inferior human beings,\" would be a burden for American laborers in many ways: they would live on the labor of White people, stop producing goods and therefore generate an increase of price for these goods. They would not be consumers of northern goods any more, and they would increase crime and pauperism in the States.  He therefore encouraged American people to reflect upon these elements before abolishing slavery. Destroying slavery in the West Indies and in the United States would be equivalent to destroying hundreds of farmers, or of laborers.","Van Evrie claimed his tract about \"Free Negroism…\" to be a response to the \"innumerable\" abolitionist tracts published in the early 1860s.

Although he was captured within months, his rebellion had unintended consequences. It added fuel to an already growing fire – the movement to send free blacks to Liberia.

This solution has a \"threefold benefit\" because whites \"should be cleared of them,\" it helps Africa by having a civilized, Christian group living there, and \"our blacks themselves would be put in a better situation.\" To enhance his argument, Carey used excerpts from several state legislatures that approve of the colonization of Liberia as well as explaining the available opportunities for blacks in the colony. Blacks were able to \"cultivate their minds\" and be \"lords of the soil.\" Although this movement saw itself as benevolent, it was designed to rid the U.S. of free blacks, not to eliminate prejudices. ","            Although the argument for Liberia persuaded many, it still lacked funding. Carey acknowledged that many masters left money for their slaves to be transported to Africa, but in most cases, passage was extremely expensive. Researching the colonization of Liberia, Charles Foster explains that \"such an ambitious program would require capital beyond the powers of private benevolence.\"  Carey seemed to acknowledge the high price tag, but citied rhetorically  \"was any great object ever attained without great sacrifices?\"  To ease the financial burden, Carey suggested a Constitutional Amendment to appropriate funds for the cause as well as having individual state legislatures make donations.  Carey claimed that \"never did a nation appropriate money for a more valuable purpose.\"","            The desire to help free blacks emigrate and colonize Liberia was stressed throughout Carey's pamphlet. However, he spent little time talking about how free blacks feel about the movement. Carey did this for a reason – many free blacks had little enthusiasm about moving to Liberia.

Cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and wheat were cultivated on large plantations that saw tremendous profits. A large amount of cheap labor was essential to producing these profits. This cheap labor came in the form of slavery, and it allowed an immense amount of work to be done without costing too much. Without slavery this rapid economic expansion would not have been possible. There is no doubt that slavery was cruel and evil, but was it a necessary evil?","Initially, when Britain arrived in the Americas a plantation system was utilized. Their mercantilist ideas caused the people in the Americas to produce as much as possible in order to achieve the greatest wealth. This system utilized cheap slave labor to tend the large amount of crops on these plantations. However, this labor was cruel and unusual, and was one of the most debated issues within American society for three centuries. The conditions slaves had to endure were unjustifiable. Slaves lived in shacks, ate small amounts of food, were constantly separated from family members, and were beaten with any act of misconduct. Disease, malnutrition, sickness, injuries, and death were prevalent throughout most of the slave accommodations. There was a constant push for the abolition of slavery because it contradicted the ‘”all men are created equal” idea implemented in American society. “It is most certain that all Men, as they are the Sons of Adam, are; and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life.”[1] This came from a publication in a Boston journal in 1700. The article expressed the wrongs of the slave trade by referring to the specific selling of a slave named Joseph. “There is no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and liberty.”<sup>1</sup> The journal expressed this exchange as a lack of humanity towards Joseph. If humans were bought with money then they were not humans at all. The article produces a vivid argument for the contradicting idea of slavery. Americans expressed equal rights for all humans, but treated slaves with little humanity and respect.","Consequently, it is obvious and definite that slavery was cruel, sacrilegious, barbaric, and absolutely unjustifiable. But was it necessary for the progress of the Americas? During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Americas saw a gigantic increase in production and therefore profitability. This increase in production was only possible because of the immense amount of cheap labor supplied by slavery and the slave trade. “Slavery was overall very beneficial for Southerners. After 1830 cotton was booming and it became extremely profitable for a southerner to have a slave.”[2] The Americas had two established cash crops, cotton and tobacco. Both of these crops were labor intensive and required a great deal of manual work. It is apparent that the most cost effective way to utilize these cash crops would be to somehow implement large groups of cheap laborers. With this in mind; it is obvious the best economical solution would have been to use slavery. For this reason, slavery was necessary for the economic progression America saw in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.","In summation, no matter how necessary slavery was to the economic progression of the Americas it does not justify it in any way. But I can understand the thought process of the people at the time. Utilizing slavery was the best possible solution for cheap labor and directly contributed to the wealthy nation we are today. Slavery was evil, but also the most economically beneficial form of production during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."," ","[1] Green, Bartholomew . \"The Selling of Joseph .\" Ames. Cas.

I found thirty-five that directly referenced the health of specific slaves or mentioned their ability to perform work.  Of the thirty-five letters, twenty-seven addressed poor health or illness while eight mentioned the overall good health of the slaves.  Sickness and illness, especially the “chills” of fever seem to be most prevalent in the winter months. An obvious inference is that more slaves became ill during the fall flu season, however tropical diseases may have been the cause. ","   According to the statistics compiled by Geneology Trails Alabama experienced a yellow fever epidemic every year from 1841-1849 with outbreaks first reported between August and September each year.  This corresponds with the highest mention of sickness in letters from Charles Lewellyn, the overseer of the Cameron Plantation in Greene County Alabama, to Paul Cameron the owner which occurred in the fall of 1847.  Lewellyn mentioned twenty-two sick slaves on September 28, 1847 and seventeen sick on October 26, 1847.  Lewellyn reported that three slaves died of chills in his letter on September 28, 1847.  There were 78 recorded deaths attributed to yellow fever in 1847 in Alabama.","     The theory that mosquitoes were vectors for yellow fever was not proposed until 1899.  Prior to 1899 no measures were taken to reduce the propagation of mosquito populations.  According to the World Health Organization, yellow fever begins suddenly after an incubation period of three to six days.   Most cases only cause a mild infection with fever, headache, chills, back pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting.  In these cases the infection lasts only three to four days. 15% of cases enter a second, toxic phase of the disease with recurring fever, this time accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage, as well as abdominal pain which can result in death.  The medical knowledge in the mid 1800’s consisted of knowing that yellow fever was a tropical disease that usually originated in the Caribbean and was transmitted to coastal southern United States.  The primary form of preventing the spread of the disease was to quarantine the affected geographic area until after the first frost of the fall which was believed to kill off the disease which we now know to include the mosquito population.","    Lewellyn’s reports of major illness amongst the slave population end in early November of 1847.  There is only one mention of health after the November letters which was written on January 7, 1847 and mentioned the good health of the slave family.  This could be due to the end of the yellow fever epidemic or to the break in field work over the holidays following the completion of the cotton harvest. It seems that Charles Lewellyn did not have a sufficient knowledge of yellow fever to adequately attend to the health of the slaves in Alabama.  I was unable to differentiate between possible yellow fever and influenza or common colds in the descriptions of the health of slaves.  Lewellyn does not mention any yellow coloring of the slaves nor does he mention any efforts to quarantine the sick."],"display_date":"September 28, 1847 - October 26, 1847","search_date":"1847-10-12","locations":[{"id":174,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":404,"tag":"Illness"},{"id":403,"tag":"Yellow Fever"},{"id":144,"tag":"plantation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4802,"title":"Child Mortality on an Alabama Plantation","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-06-25","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Disease was rampant among the slave population in the Antebellum South. Poor diet, less than adequate clothing, and exposure to the elements, caused the immune systems of the over-worked laborers to break down, making them susceptible to contracting a variety of illnesses. A demographic that was particularly at risk were children age nine and under. Fully 45 out of every 10,000 slave children aged nine or younger died of diseases in the late 1840s. This compared compared to 11 out of every 10,000 white children of the same age. Dropsy, congestive chill, pneumonia, and fever are diseases that slaves would often battle in the Antebellum South. While doctors were often called in to give aid to sick slaves on plantations, medicine in the 1840s was lacking in its effectiveness, and slaves were not given the same level of treatment as white citizens. The Cameron family of North Carolina and Alabama detail in their correspondence with one another, the sickness and diseases of their slaves, many of whom are children.<br /><br />Sick children are mentioned at least nine times in the Cameron family letters, with several more instances of sickness among the adults mentioned on both the Stagville and Greene County, Alabama plantations. Diley was a slave on the Cameron’s Alabama plantation in the 1840s. He is mentioned several times in various letters written from Charles Llewellyn, the overseer of the Cameron’s Alabama operations, and Paul Cameron, owner of the Stagville plantation. Diley has a child, whose name is unknown, who is first mentioned as being sick on June 25, 1846. During the summer, slaves on cotton plantations would spend time chopping the cotton plants, and keeping the middles of the cotton rows free from weeds and other unwanted vegetation. This meant spending countless hours outside in the fields, with exposure to the elements and disease carrying insects. Children often worked alongside the adults in the cotton fields, assisting with these duties. While the cause of sickness is officially unknown, it is likely that Diley’s child fell ill due to insect-born disease.  There is another mention of a child of Diley’s, perhaps a different one, being ill on May 1 of the following year in a letter authored by Charles Llewellyn and sent to Paul Cameron. In a letter from Charles Llewellyn to Paul Cameron on May 21 1847, Llewellyn writes that “Diley has lost his youngest child, the Doctor was not sent for to it, nor I have not sent for a doctor but once since you left; when sent for, Doctor Ring, my reason for sending for him is I wanted a doctor as soon as he could get here or not at all.” This death occurs nearly one year after the first case of sickness among Diley’s children is mentioned. One could assume that this death is that of the previously mentioned sick child in Llewellyn’s letter to Cameron on May 1<sup>st</sup> 1847, though this cannot be certain. It is possible that Diley had more than one sick child. This is just one of several cases of child fatalities mentioned in the letters. There are several other slaves sick on the Greene County plantation, so a child with a compromised immune system exposed to sick adults who have endured a hard winter themselves, would easily fall ill. Illness on plantations often meant death, especially among the child slave population."],"display_date":"June 25, 1846 - December 31, 1849","search_date":"1848-03-28","locations":[{"id":174,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":144,"tag":"plantation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":407,"tag":"Death"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4803,"title":"The Second Middle Passage: Slavery Moves West","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-09-05","end_date":"1846-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The second stage of the transatlantic slave trade was also called the Middle Passage. The Middle Passage was a horrifying experience for slaves headed to the Americas. Slaves were quartered on ships for up to two months and treated as cargo. They were often chained in shackles and kept below deck where they had to lay down because there was less than three feet of height. There was never enough food or fresh air for the slaves. Many of the slaves died of starvation and disease. Some were so tortured by the trip that they threw themselves overboard. The floors where the slaves were kept were usually covered with excrement and blood. Sometimes the slaves were given exercise on nice days. This exercise included being made to dance, jump and sing by the sailors using whips. The sailors took out their frustration on female slaves. Due to all of these and more circumstances there was an 11% mortality rate of slaves on these ships.<br /><br />Around the mid 1800’s tobacco had drained all the nutrients out of the soil and plantation owners like the Cameron’s moved west with the expansion of cotton. Most of the slaves that were sent west were did so with slave traders. Very rarely did slaves travel west with their families and owners. Most slaves were forced to walk across the south, chained together. They were devoid of human interaction. The death rate was lower on this second middle passage than it was on the passage across the Atlantic but it was still higher than the death rate at that time. The slaves were not fed enough, they were not given clean water nor were they allowed to rest enough on their long journey. Once they arrived in this new land they had to farm a new crop. They were working longer hours with more back breaking labor. They had lost all semblance of a life they had had back east.<br /><br />Through the Cameron letters we can see that Paul Cameron purchased land in Greene County, Alabama and he chose to move his slaves west instead of purchasing slaves once he reached the new plantation. A man named Mr. Laws was hired to transport the slaves and they each cost between 6 and 7 dollars to move [1]. Paul had to convince his father that moving the slaves would be beneficial [2]. The party would travel with tents and wagons [3]. Paul Cameron would travel part of the way with his slaves and then continue on alone. The slaves would travel as a group with Mr. Laws [1]. All of the slaves besides one, Edmond survived the trip. Paul told his father in a letter sent after their arrival that they could not have rented any slaves better than their own and he would not buy any slaves from that part of the country. He also told his father that according to Mr. Laws, no other slaves had been brought to Alabama under better circumstances [4].<br /><br />Despite Paul Cameron’s best attempts to move his slaves humanely and to make sure that they had proper living quarters the slaves were still negatively affected by the move [4]. Not only were the slaves constantly fighting diseases but they were working hours they had never been forced to do before. The slaves wanted to go back to North Carolina. One slave, Milton, actually did run away from Greene County and head back to his home in North Carolina. During this second middle passage more slaves choose to steal away in the night than face the hard travel and work. Due to the late hours the slaves were working they no longer had time to cultivate their own vegetables and livestock therefore their diet changed. In another letter from Paul Cameron to his father his discusses the change in the slaves. The older slaves seemed to have withered away [5]. Paul Cameron also told his father about how the slaves were hoping for some extra rest at the holidays. The slaves usually celebrated the holidays in North Carolina by frolicking at festivities but in Alabama the work exhausted them so much that while they would like to frolic they preferred to rest [6].<br /><br />The Camerons were an exception to the rule during this passage. They choose to move their slaves rather than buy new ones. Paul Cameron may have thought no better slaves would be found in Alabama than his own. He may also have figured that despite the amount it cost to transport his slaves west he would have saved time and money when setting up the new plantation. However, the slaves were negatively affected by this trip. Their health was diminished, their quality of life was worse and their new lives were drastically different from their old ones. The work was harder and the pay out was smaller. While the trip and the experiences directly relating to this transfer, was not as devastating for the slave population as the original middle passage had been the men, women and children who were forced to walk from North Carolina to Alabama would never be the same.<br /><br />References:<br />[1] Letter from Paul Cameron to his father Duncan Cameron on October 25th 1844<br />[2] Letter from Paul Cameron to his father Duncan Cameron on September 5th 1844<br />[3] Letter from Paul Cameron to his father Duncan Cameron on October 12th 1844<br />[4] Letter from Paul Cameron to his father Duncan Cameron on December 7th 1844<br />[5] Letter from Paul Cameron to his father Duncan Cameron December 1st 1846<br />[6] Letter from Paul Cameron to his father Duncan Cameron December 19th 1845<br />[7] www.understandingslavery.com<br />[8] www.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_united_states#second_middle_p..."],"display_date":"September 5, 1844 - December 1, 1846","search_date":"1845-10-18","locations":[{"id":9683,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"},{"id":174,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":400,"tag":"Cameron family"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4804,"title":"Cameron Family Concern for Slave Health","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-10-01","end_date":"1847-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The good health of a slave was essential to a plantation owner. Without healthy slaves, there would be no successful plantation, and in turn no successful owner. This idea was only further confirmed after continued research into the Cameron family letters. From the information gathered it seems that the Cameron family genuinely wished for their slaves to remain healthy. The jury is out on whether this is for selfish reasons, such as maintenance of a successful estate, or for more selfless reasons, such as truly wishing that they remain in the best conditions.","The information provided to historians by way of the Cameron family personal letters has proved to be very enlightening in this debate. There are numerous references to a Dr. Ring attending to the slaves on different accounts. The first mention of this is in a letter from Dr. Ring himself to Mr. Cameron. In this letter Ring relays his work on a hearty slave named Limon. Mr. Charles Lewellyn, overseer of the Cameron plantation, sent for Ring to come and care for Limon after he fell very ill. Ring tells Cameron that he found Limon dying but that he could not attribute the reason to anything Lewellyn had done. We can speculate that perhaps Ring was checking up on Lewellyn’s work as the overseer as well as checking up on the ill slaves.  As the letter continues the reader learns that Lewellyn may have served as a temporary physician to the slaves when a doctor could not, or would not, come to the estate. Ring tells Cameron that Lewellyn administered aid to Limon and had seemed to heal him before Limon took a turn for the worst. Ring was at the plantation less than 24 hours when Limon died.","The death of a reputable slave was cause for concern for Cameron and it seems that more letters were exchanged as Mr. Cameron searched for the real reason of Limon’s untimely death since it occurred at the end of cotton season when a strong slave would certainly be useful in harvesting cotton. In the next few letters between Lewellyn and Cameron, Lewellyn reports on Dr. Ring’s whereabouts and his role in helping the slaves. There are also mentions of other doctors treating slaves in letters between Mr. Cameron and Thomas Bennehan. There is a reference to a Dr. Haywood, who resides in Raleigh, as he is concerned that his care for a very ill slave, Mildred, was perceived as unprofessional since Mildred is later taken to Philadelphia for better care.  More doctors are mentioned in later letters as other sources of medical information for the vast amount of slaves who fell ill in the years of 1846 and 1847.","As we can infer from multiple letters, the Cameron family did genuinely wish for the best care for their slaves. The letters tell the readers that not all care served its purpose, such as Dr. Ring’s work with Limon or Dr. Haywood’s attention to Mildred, which in turn led the Camerons to seek aid elsewhere. Although we cannot officially confirm the motive behind their kind treatment of their ill slaves but we can infer that the Cameron family wished for the best in these instances."],"display_date":"October 1846 - December 1847","search_date":"1847-05-17","locations":[{"id":9479,"lat":35.4918331625,"lng":-77.6685888168,"zoom":10,"place":"GREENE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":400,"tag":"Cameron family"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4806,"title":"Slave Owner Uses Modern Medicine to Treat Malaria","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-09-21","end_date":"1846-09-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["         In late September 1846 several slaves from the Fairntosh plantation in Durham, North Carolina fell sick with malaria.

Neither his concern over the health of his slaves however, nor his quickness to use newer medical treatments, necessarily indicate that Paul Cameron was a more humane owner of slaves, or that he possessed more egalitarian views. Rather, Paul’s use of medicines was part of a larger debate over medical treatment for slaves. The development and application of medical science was part of the ideological environment of the Antebellum South and an important argument for the justification of Slavery."," ","         The US South in the 19<sup>th</sup> century was an unhealthy place. Epidemics of cholera, yellow fever, and typhoid ravaged the population, killing many of those infected. Malaria, though not as lethal as other common diseases, was a great concern for slave owners as it could severely weaken their work force. Spread through the Anopheles mosquito, the parasite causing malaria damages the blood cells and the liver and causes fever, vomiting, chills and headaches. Though it infrequently causes death, the initial infection can last several weeks, and relapses of symptoms can occur months, even years, after the initial infection. 19<sup>th</sup> century physicians did not understand the origins of the disease, nor that it was spread through mosquitoes, but that did not stop them from prescribing a multitude of treatments for what they referred to as “fever and chills” or the “autumnal fever”. In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century a debate arouse over the proper treatment of slaves who contracted malaria. "," ","         Physicians were not taught specific treatments for slave diseases, despite calls for such training, and owners and doctors alike were left guessing over the proper course of medical treatment. (Savit 1981) Treatments such as bleeding and blistering had fallen out of use on whites, but were still prescribed for blacks suffering from the same diseases. Prevailing medical thought considered slaves to be resistant to malaria and other tropical diseases, and “those few blacks who fell victim to the fever were treated in a simple manner. Hot bricks were applied to the feet, hot brandy or water given in large quantities, as well as hot snake-root tea containing forty or fifty drops of spirit of ammonia.”(Haller 1973) This spirit of ammonia is likely the medicine Paul gave to his sick slaves."," ","         Paul was confident that this minimal treatment would suffice because the leading physicians of his day believed blacks to be resistant to malaria and other tropical diseases. This belief served as a justification for the institution of slavery, as such resistance was seen as evidence of Africans’ natural suitability and inclination for fieldwork. Paul’s treatment of his slaves was modern in comparison to his Alabama overseer Charles Lewellyn, who generally took a less active approach to his sick slaves. Yet, this attention should not be considered to be an indication of a kinder type of slave owner or a rejection of the harshness of the plantation system. The modern medical science practiced in the Antebellum South created new justifications for the institution of slavery. Paul Cameron may have been modern in his application of medical science, but his motives were grounded in an ideology of racial inferiority that served to legitimize slavery. "],"display_date":"September 21, 1846 - September 26, 1846","search_date":"1846-09-23","locations":[{"id":9683,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4813,"title":"Greene County Goes Yellow with Fever","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-01","end_date":"1847-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1847 inhabitants of the Mississippi River basin  had to deal with an outbreak of Yellow Fever.  Transmitted by mosquitoes, Yellow Fever caused symptoms including fevers, chills, headaches and nausea.  In the later months of 1847 the letters that overseer Charles Lewellyn sent to Paul Cameron about the condition of his plantation were fraught with the names of slave that were ill, recovering or had passes from work.  Many of the symptoms that Lewellyn described to Paul Cameron are commonly associated with Yellow Fever.  The illness that was affecting many of the people on the plantation came during the harvesting season a devastating time in Antebellum South for an illness to plague the plantations. ","In the letter sent to Paul Cameron on October 20, 1847, Lewellyn writes that somewhere between 15-40 slaves are sick with fever and chills.  In that same letter Lewellyn mentions that the neighboring plantations seem to fairing worse than they are when it comes to the illness among their slaves.  Though there is no specific mention of Yellow Fever as the illness that was affecting the slaves in Charles Lewellyn’s letters one can infer that this is what was affecting many of the plantation in the areas.  With widespread illness in the same area and symptoms that are commonly associated with Yellow Fever it seems likely that the 1847 epidemic was the cause of the illness that Charles Lewellyn had to deal with in the later months of 1847.","This threat of Yellow Fever could have been enhanced by the increase of rain fall in 1846.  In a letter dated April 30, 1846, Lewellyn discusses the impact of the increased rain on harvesting the cotton.  In this letter he mentions how the rain was so heavy he was going to need to replant some of the fields that had already been planted because the rain washed away what had been there.  Both the corn and cotton crops were affected by the rain.  Excessive rain would lead to increased areas of stagnant water, the preferred breeding ground for Mosquitoes. This increase in the Mosquito population  helped fuel the 1847 Yellow Fever epidemic only a few months later. ","According to the World Health Organization only approximately 15% of current cases of Yellow Fever reach the second more deadly stage of the virus that is deadly.  Though there is no concrete data that suggests what the mortality rate of Yellow Fever was in 1847, limited medical knowledge about the treatment of the virus probably led to more deaths then is witnessed today.  The Yellow Fever epidemic likely affected many of the plantations around Paul Cameron’s in Alabama.  Slaves spent countless hours outside during the harvest seasons increasing their exposure to the virus.  Charles Lewellyn would have been fighting a losing battle against Yellow Fever during the harvest months because of this.  Though even a Yellow Fever epidemic would not stop the harvesting on plantation of countless amounts of money in crops. "],"display_date":1847,"search_date":"1847-07-02","locations":[{"id":9683,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"},{"id":174,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":417,"tag":"Plague"},{"id":400,"tag":"Cameron family"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":403,"tag":"Yellow Fever"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4814,"title":"\"Weather\" or not a slave was treated well.","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-09-01","end_date":"1847-12-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When we learn about slavery and the slaves’ masters we often get a picture of an evil cold hearted man, who would whip and torment slaves, while they worked in weather conditions that made it impossible to get any work done. We also often assume that their (the slaves) masters would force them to work whether they were sick or even near death. Using the plantation letters from the Cameron Family we can create a different interpretation. Through these letters we can use the weather as an indicator to determine how well slaves were being treated and cared for on the plantation. This is not to downplay the immoral act of slavery or to say that there were not slave masters who treated slaves poorly because they did exist. Rather, the theme of weather and its patterns, across the letters, can give us a better understanding of how slaves were cared for and treated.","Between the years of 1845 and 1847, there are several instances where Lewellyn (the overseer of the plantation) shares his account of the weather conditions and his inability to get work done on the field. “The Negroes will make an effort to get out the crop by the 25<sup>th</sup> if the weather will permit it being done- but I fear they will not do so.” Even with good weather and the opportunity to get things done, illness has stopped their progress. “The weather here is very warm today, more like July than November, and yet we have a great deal of disease in our Negro family.” Regardless of the weather, if it was too hot or too cold, and without consideration for the slaves’ health, Lewellyn could have easily demanded that the slaves “weather the storm” and worked under any condition. Mr. Cameron, as well, could have ordered Lewellyn to put the slaves to work under any circumstance to ensure the production of his crops. The fact that they did not resort to those measures suggests that the overall health and wellness of their slaves were important. Productive, healthy slaves seems to be Mr. Cameron’s priority when he requested “the overseer to keep the [unintelligible] in the house as I [unintelligible] suffer more cold.” We can assume that Mr. Cameron’s request pertains to keeping the slaves inside to protect them from getting sick and to keep them healthy.","One may think that the Lewellyn’s or Paul Cameron’s intentions were for the good of the plantation and the production of the crop and not so much about the health and well-being of the slaves. Wilkins and Wilson suggest, with regards to the treatment of slaves, that most slave masters were not as brutal or sadistic as one is lead to believe. “<em>The Slave Narratives </em>are overwhelmingly favorable in the judgment of slave masters as ‘good men.’” They found out of 331 narratives that had a reference to a master, 86% suggested that their masters were “good” or “kind.” Some of those references also suggested that the master did not allow whippings and a number of them only allowed whippings while they were present.  Wilkins and Wilson also suggest that slave masters did not want slaves who were defiant and lazy. They wanted hardworking and responsible slaves.  “Such attitudes cannot be beaten into slaves. They had to be elicited.”","It is easy to believe that slave masters and overseers treated slaves as less than human or measured their importance to the amount of labor they contributed to. We can use the weather as an indication of how slaves were treated. From what we learn about, we would believe that slaves were constantly placed in situations that jeopardized their health and well-being, in order to produce and gather crops. These letters help paint a different picture. Slaves were relieved from working in the fields when weather conditions prohibited them from doing so. With numerous amounts of “rain days” many would assume that an overseer or a plantation owner would over work their slaves to make up for the loss production of their crops. At least in this case, by analyzing weather patterns and conditions we can determine the treatment of slaves and the relationship between slave master and slave."],"display_date":"September 1, 1845 - December 30, 1847","search_date":"1846-10-31","locations":[{"id":9680,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"},{"id":172,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":420,"tag":"Slaves"},{"id":419,"tag":"Weather"},{"id":144,"tag":"plantation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4832,"title":"Slave Life and Sickness","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-11-01","end_date":"1846-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From the original letters between the Cameron family and their employees, slaves are often mentioned since they are an integral part of the plantation operation. Since the letters were not written or received by the slaves themselves, the language is often derogatory or just in reference to the slaves as property of value. These letters show the nature of the culture and the lack of respect and responsibility that slaves are given for their part in the antebellum southern economic system.","Sickness appears to be a way of life for the slaves on southern plantations. Throughout the Cameron family letters, the names of various slaves are mentioned as being sick and unable to work. Some slaves are mentioned in multiple letters and eventually as having succumbed to sickness and overwork. A couple of these slaves that are mentioned repeatedly in the letters are Joe and Henderson. They come up because they are sick for a very long time. Henderson is sick from at least November 1844 till July 1846 and Joe from at least May 1845 till June 1846.","These men are mentioned 10 times in the letters transcribed from Charles Lewellyn (the foreman of the plantation) to Paul Cameron (the Cameron family member in charge of the plantation) and once in a letter from Paul Cameron to Duncan Cameron (Paul’s father). The letters from Lewellyn tell a very functional story about the number of hands that he is able to have at work with reference to the trips that Paul has made to inspect the situation himself. He does make a comment about the limits of their workload in September 1845. He says that they “won’t haul water for the hands”. An interesting note here is that he does not say that they “can’t” haul water, but that they won’t. This may just be a verbal slip but it could also be an insight into the degree to which the slaves are allowed to decide how much work they are able to perform.","The letter from Paul to his father tells a slightly different story and is a little more elaborative. Paul has a very limited outlook for the two slaves. He recognizes that there has been no improvement in Henderson since he saw him a year ago, a very long time for sickness. His judgment on Joe is not much better. The comparison of this account with that of Lewellyn seems to indicate that Paul has a less realistic view of the health of these two men. It could be that he is writing to prepare his father for the likely case that these men will have to be replaced knowing that a more dire report is safer than a rosier one.","<strong>Here are the references to Joe and Henderson in chronological order:</strong>","May 11, 1845: “Joe and Henderson are as they was when you left here”","August 1, 1845: “There is none of the hands now in the house dangerous at this time.

Dunham, inspector of customs at New Smyrna, located a small schooner from Virginia that was operating quite oddly. The ‘John Richard” which was captained by James Spillman, arrived in St. Augustine from Alexandria with provisions for the U.S. troops that were stationed in Florida. Captain Spillman intended to immediately stock-up and depart for the West Indies under the pretence of getting a cargo of fruit to take to New York. Dunham was informed that the vessel had in fact been charted to go to Nassau to bring into the Florida territory about 40 Negro slaves; belonging to two gentlemen residing on separate plantations along the coast where Dunham was stationed. Four days later the inspector received further information from “a gentleman of this place entitled to credit” about the Nassau slaver. What Dunham had notified about was that the correct number of slaves onboard the John Richard was actually around 100, and not 40. This new information also brought a sense of helplessness with the fact that now days later, the John Richard and all the slaves that were in it had left the port. Dunham confirmed in himself that the slaves involved in this trade would probably be carried to the coast along the Gulf of Mexico and placed on shore somewhere between Tampa and St. Marks. There it would be a very easy matter after those slaves were landed to spread them into the interior of the state and slowly afterwards get rid of them at the owners expense. Even with all this information and a more than knowledgeable approach as to where the slaves would be unloaded, Dunham’s claims went relatively unnoticed until his letter of the fifth instant respecting the slaves newly introduced into his district, had been received by the District Attorney. Incredibly, it was more than five years (1831) until the Secretary of Treasury returned the Report to Dunham. The truth was that slave trading wasn’t all that informal, and although the slaves had to be smuggled into the country, many people in power chose to ignore the influx of slaves because frankly, America needed them to ensure it’s ability to continue producing. Letters to and from the collectors of slaves helps to enforce the fact that their was actual Americans who had intel on the slave trading business and although they seldom caught and prosecuted the captains responsible – at least they were concerned with and passionate about stopping slavery."],"display_date":"June 6, 1826 - July 2, 1831","search_date":"1828-12-17","locations":[{"id":1281,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":443,"tag":"Smuggling"},{"id":444,"tag":"New Smyrna"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4846,"title":"Patriarchal Slave System: How it worked","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-01-01","end_date":"1829-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["<br /> ”Patriarchy is a system where males are the head of the family and have all the rights of decision-making,”a system that has persisted for many years in American History. Patriarchy was not only used in government bodies, but it was also used in determining a slave child’s fate. In A Treatise on the Patriarchal or Co-Operative System of Society a humble servant by the name of Z. Kingsley allows to find out how a couple’s offspring’s destiny was chose for them by their parent’s social status. <br /> Agriculture was a great foundation to the slave trade business, a business that soon became very popular among countries such as Spain, France, and the United States. Slaves were brought in from African countries and put to work in farms under the ruling of, more often than not, a white male. Sons and daughters of these slaves future all depended on the social status of their parents. Soon enough this procedure became a law, a “law that entitles the children of free quarteroons, to all white privileges, if the father is white.” Children, whose fathers were slaves, became slaves, and children whose father was white, was to have all of the same rights as a white would hold. <br /> Families were separated and many never reencountered after being transported to different parts to continue their lives as slaves. Children often loathed their parents for being slaves, and many ran away after search for freedom. White Americans benefited greatly from this new law. The reproduction of slaves greatly favored plantation owners since it added more slaves to work their land. Young children were not allowed to work in the fields, so masters often had children working in the house, doing chores such as cleaning. Many plantation owners allowed the children to stay in their house and play with the other children. After a certain age, they were placed along with the other slaves on the fields. <br /> Slave’s offspring was not only way slave population augmented. “The slave trade was the mechanism by which one of history’s greatest mass population transfers was affected,” and this was proven truth by the amounts of slaves that were being transferred over from Africa to America; men, women, and children. Ships were being sent over from all over African and European continent filled with slaves. While lives were being torn apart, and families were detached from their roots, American economy was increasing with every slave that stepped foot on slave soil. <br /> Slavery was a never-ending cycle, and slaves began to accept the fact that the slaves themselves and their children would be in bondage for the rest of their lives. Escaping the rigorous life of a slave was almost an impossible dream to achieve. The patriarchal system ruined the lives of young girls and boys who often dreamed of being free and returning to their homeland. The fight for their freedom was reflected on misconduct of many slaves, but such rebellions only cause them more pain. African American’s lives were changed, the only aspect being passed on from one generation to the next, was that of being a slave."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":1829,"search_date":"1829-07-02","locations":[{"id":14215,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":135,"tag":"Zephaniah Kingsley"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":456,"tag":"Patriarchy"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4847,"title":"Abner Jordan Shares His Life as a Slave","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"3/1/30","end_date":"3/31/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Abner Jordan was interviewed by a member of the Work Projects Administration for a Federal Writer’ Project that was documenting North Carolina slave narratives. Jordan has never left North Carolina since he was born there and agreed to the interview despite being the old age of 95. He discussed his birth with hesitance, claiming that he was “bawn about 1832 in Staggsville, Marse Cameron’s place”. Jordan ‘belonged’ to Marse Paul and interestingly enough, lived in an overcrowded two-story slave house on the Staggsville Plantation along with his parents and 13 other brothers and sisters. When he was of age, Abner Jordan attempted to run away with his closest friend (Marse Benny) and enlist in the war, however his master went and brought him back scolding him for “being too young to go and fight de Yankees”. Paul Cameron owned more than nine hundred slaves and he spread them out along his thirty thousand acre plantation. It was established in 1787 by the Bennehan and Cameron families, Stagville was the largest plantation in North Carolina. Abner Jordan said Paul Cameron owned so many slaves that, “when he meet dem in the road he wouldn’t know dem and when he ased dem who dey belonged to, dey’ tell him dey belonged to Marse Paul Cameron and he would say dat wus all right and from dem to go right on along”. Jordan’s father was a blacksmith who was also in charge of blowing the horn for the other slaves to come in from the fields at night. He noted that slaves were forbidden to leave the fields without Marse Cameron telling them they could, and only then could they go to their respective parts on the plantation. When the Civil War reached Stagville, the plantation was seized but rather than being concerned with the slaves, Northern soldiers were instead only interested in provisions, horses, and where Cameron had hid his silver & gold. After the surrender, Jordan’s family was one of the few couplings of African Americans to remain with Paul Cameron, and they did so for around five years.","An exterior picture of the two-story slave house on the Stagville Plantation for which Abner Jordan lived in, offers  an extra step into the life that Jordan was trying to humanize. Paul Cameron ordered the slave house to be built in the hopes that it would improve the health of those who had been living in poorly-constructed, leaky, dirt-floored cabins (which were very common on his plantation). After all, slaves that were healthy and rested could produce much more for their masters than those who were malnourished. The house that Jordan lived in is the only surviving two-story slave house in North Carolina, it housed African Americans with a common family name and lineage, with a single family consisting of 5-7 individuals living in each other four rooms in the house.

It has forced people to become more aware of their racial identity and moreover, it has been taken to the extent of violence as well as less extreme scenarios. In her 1928 essay about racial identity and segregation, Zora Neale Hurston claims, “I remember the very first day I became colored.”[2] She wrote that moving to a new region and coming face to face with segregation first exposed her to racial identity. Until this point she knew very little about the role segregation and racial identity played in American culture.","Initially, Zora lived in a primarily Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. In Eatonville she knew very little about segregation and the role it played in African American lives. The only white people Zora knew were those who simply passed through town, coming from or going to Orlando. She would salute them while they were passing and the white men were always very courteous and friendly. They would ask her to dance and sing, and would give her small amounts of money for her performance. Zora thought her fellow townspeople acted strange when these white people passed through her town because they would peer through curtains and most were afraid to come out on their porches. However, Zora did not think much of it and thought “white people differed from colored only in that they rode through town and never lived there.”<sup>2</sup>","Finally, Zora was confronted with her first taste of segregation and the large imaginative line that was drawn between whites and blacks when she was thirteen. Zora was sent off to school in Jacksonville where she first became aware of her skin color. She was treated differently in several different ways, but claims she was not sorrowful or ashamed of her heritage at any point. “I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more of less. No, I do not weep at the world--I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.”[3] Someone was always letting Zora know in some way that she is the granddaughter of slaves. Whether it was the inability to make some white friends, or her peers teasing her at school she refused to let it depress her.","Accordingly, segregation has shaped American culture for the past two centuries, and discreetly continues to do so today. Immediately following the Civil War and the emancipation of African American Slaves, there was obviously resentment between races. This resentment turned into extreme segregation, hatred, and even violence. This extreme segregation shaped American culture for almost half a century. Restaurants, parks, bathrooms, hotels, and many other public facilities turned into establishments that would split races apart. This segregation led to verbal and physical arguments and would often lead to horrendous acts of violence and abuse. Consequently, Zora mentions numerous instances of lynching and use of weapons resulting from this tension. The relationship between blacks and whites, especially post- Civil War, seemed almost worse than when blacks were slaves. Children who were not raised during the time of slavery were and are still forced to lead lives completely shaped by segregation. Children were often forced to stop communicating with friends of other races because the hatred and resentment was so intense during this time.","Furthermore, prejudice and discrimination affected the minds and emotions of many children. A study was conducted by Kenneth and Mamie Clark to investigate children’s racial identification and preference. They used dolls and drawings to decipher which images children preferred and which matched closest to their own skin color. The findings concluded that many black children preferred the white doll or drawing, and often picked colors that were lighter than their own skin color. Kenneth and Mamie also observe that their findings \"indicate a clear-cut preference for white and some of them evidence emotional conflict when requested to indicate a color preference. It is clear that the Negro child, by the age of five is aware of the fact that to be colored in contemporary American society is a mark of inferior status. A child accepts as early as six, seven or eight the negative stereotypes about his own group.\"[4] In fact, these decisive observations helped determine that schools should not be segregated by the Supreme Court case, <em>Plessy v. Ferguson.</em>","Segregation is still currently present in the United States, though not to the extreme of violence as it was thirty to fifty years ago. Affirmative action, all black colleges, scholarships, beauty pageants, and organizations exemplify putting racial categorizing. The initial concept of segregation following the Civil War contributed to these examples of segregation in American culture today.

and, after allowance, their time was usually employed in hoeing their corn, and getting a supply of fish for the week.”[5]","Kingsley was definitely an opportunist; he recognized the economic compensation of keeping his slaves happy by giving them sufficient shelter.  The labor force will perform better when they are content, thus increasing productivity.  Also he was considered an economic opportunist of his time because after Zephaniah Kingsley bought slaves, he would train and teach them labor and sell the slaves for more.  He undoubtedly acknowledged the importance of keeping his slaves pleased by providing them with above average cabins, in order to have run successful plantation.  For the most part, Kingsley respected the slaves and valued their hard work.","Zephaniah Kingsley was extremely wealthy due to the fact that he was a slave owner in an incredibly lucrative industry of manual labor in the developing United States.  The more wealthy an individual was the higher they were classified in society.  Clearly, large slave owners were considered to be in the upper class.  However, Zephaniah Kingsley was not well respected among society because he married one of his African woman slaves that resided in one of the tabby cabins.[6]  Race greatly affected one’s class in society.  When the United States purchased the entire state of Florida from Spain in 1821, race relations changed.  Under Spanish rule, society was broken up into whites, free people of color, and slaves.  “But the Americans arriving in the new U.S. territory in record numbers viewed all black people-slave and free alike-as members of an inferior race and unworthy of freedom.” Although Kingsley supported slavery due to the economic benefits, “Kingsley urged the Territorial Council to pass laws encouraging emancipation.”[7] Zephaniah Kingsley was mainly known as a slave owner, but was much more than just that; he was an opportunist, economist, and activist.  Kingsley’s idea of improving housing of slavery epitomizes how he ran his plantation differently than other large plantations."," "," "],"display_date":"1803 - 1821","search_date":"1812-07-01","locations":[{"id":15818,"lat":32.3884987877,"lng":-82.3675347364,"zoom":8,"place":"Montgomery, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":163,"tag":"Slave master"},{"id":412,"tag":"slave conditions"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":436,"tag":"florida slave history"},{"id":455,"tag":"Plantation Life"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4859,"title":"Cruelty in Florida Slave Plantations Leads to Apology and Changes Race Relations","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Florida was the sixth state to apologize for slavery, along with Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.[1]  In Florida, legislation has been considered to atone the vicious and inexcusable actions of slavery.  According to the article, <em>Giving Slaves a Voice</em>, Gary R. Mormino explains “one cannot begin to comprehend the history of Florida without understanding slavery.”[2]  Through personal interviews of seventy-two ex-slaves in Florida, it is clear that plantation life was incredibly unfair and cruel.  Apologies and reparations should be considered by all states based on the brutality within slave systems.  Money could never alleviate the emotional and physical harms brought about by the slave system.","Senator Tony Hill first purposed an apology for the acts of slavery in Florida in 2007.   In 2008, “Governor Charlie Crist initially said the state should also consider offering financial reparations to descendents of salves.  But within hours he had back away from that position.”[3]  Crist quotes, “Certainly it’s something you’d like to be able to do.”  He goes on to say, “Obviously, in a difficult budgetary time, it’s a challenging thing.  But I just want to focus on the good things that has happened today.”[4]","Slaves were brought to the shores of Florida as early as the 1500s, and the Spanish occupied the area of Florida up until 1845.  The Spanish treated blacks much better than the British slave system due to lesser punishments, and the British completely disagreed with intermixing of African Americans.  Florida made slave laws before it was even a state.[5]  Ex-slave Alex Thompson explains the blatant mercilessness of plantation life, “[Thompson’s slave master] gave us all we wanted to eat, but he cowhided us.  He had a cowhide and used to take us in a little room to whip us.  Did you ever know of master not to cowhide a nigger? [And] his wife wuz meaner to us than he wuz.”[6]  The former slaves’ first hand account expresses the reality and hostility slave masters took out on their slaves.  In fact, slaves would receive thirty-nine lashes of a whip for raising their hand at a white person, or using offensive or abusive language to a white person.  Another former Floridian slave, Charlotte Martin, remembered her oldest brother being whipped to death by Judge Wilkerson for staging an illicit church service.[7]  Although blacks did not have any freedoms during slavery, let alone freedom of religion, the killing of Charlotte Martin’s brother was definitely an inappropriate and immoral punishment.  Thus, an apology definitely seems necessary.  Interviews from former African American slaves shows that they did not have access to doctors or an education.  However, slaves managed to make natural resources as medicines and managed to educate themselves, as some slaves learned to read and write.","By 1860, 44 percent of Florida’s population was slaves.[8]  The ex-slave Frank Berry, who was considered a black Seminole with African heritage, went into detail upon race relations of blacks and whites before and after the emancipation, “Even in slavery we were treated better than we are now by the white people… Even the white people didn’t kill Negroes then as they do now.”[9]  African Americans were incredibly discriminated against by Southerns after the emancipation.  The confederates were filled with hatred towards blacks because they lost the war and slave owners lost their slaves.  Frank Berry’s quote infers the reasoning behind the formation of the Ku Klux Klan and other hatred groups.  Although blacks finally received their freedom just after the emancipation, they were still being discriminated against, and hated more than ever.  It seems clear there is an immense amount of validity to Governor Crist’s proposal for sorrow and reparation money towards descendents of slaves because racism seems to have even increased after the emancipation.  Race relations in American can be interpreted as better than ever, or still in need of dire progress.  American history can never forget what happened within the slave systems, but citizens will need to forgive in order to improve race relations."],"display_date":"1845 - 1870","search_date":"1857-12-31","locations":[{"id":1394,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":474,"tag":"Apology to Slaves"},{"id":475,"tag":"Reparations for Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4861,"title":"Slavery in Florida","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-09","end_date":"1865-02-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Florida became United States territory in 1821. Up until then, the Spanish had ruled the land for almost three hundred years. When Florida achieved statehood, the total population was twelve thousand, the majority consisting of free blacks, fugitive slaves, or Seminole, Creek or Mikasuki Indians. Some blacks found the more relaxed racial climate to their liking. By the 1730s, Spanish Florida existed as a haven for runaway slaves from Georgia and the Carolinas. While the life of a slave in colonial Florida was not necessarily better than the life of a British slave in Virginia, the institutions of government and church offered them better legal protection and far greater opportunity for freedom.","By 1830, Middle Florida had emerged as the state’s “black belt”. The vast majority of slaves lived in this region, consisting of Jackson, Gadsden, Leon, Jefferson and Madison Counties. Although cotton would come to be the main cash crop of Middle Florida, most slaveholders owning large areas grew sugarcane only for their own consumption. Planters often cultivated a variety of other crops other than their staple, such as corn, sweet potatoes, greens, squash, and okra.","On February 9, 1865 a twenty-two year old slave named Thomas was sold for fifty-five hundred dollars in Jefferson County, Florida. Life on a slave plantation improved greatly on the larger units as bondservants established extended kinship ties. Slave women often gave birth to their first children at young ages.  Sometimes, in order to keep slave families together, some masters allowed slaves the opportunity of selecting their new masters or heirs.","Religion served as a means of unifying the black community. In Florida, and other areas of the South, a mixture of Euro-Christian and African religious practices helped make life more bearable for slaves. They typically worshipped in the white-controlled churches of their masters. At Tampa’s Methodist church, some meetings were racially segregated, while others were not. Even though most sermons taught obedience, the slaves heard the message of equality before God. They came to believe firmly that the souls of slaves were as precious as those as whites. Enslaved blacks thus found within the church powerful reassurance of their humanity.","The relationship between slaves and their masters were imperative. Masters relied on their slaves as a means of survival in terms of profit. Agriculture was the main source of income for plantation owners in the South, and slaves were the ones who planted, maintained and harvested these crops in order to sell them. Slaves relied on their masters for food, shelter and protection. Most people in the antebellum era, especially poor whites, were extremely resentful towards blacks.","Slavery in Florida evolved from the Spanish, who were the first to settle there since its discovery in 1513.

Frances Cameron writes to Duncan Cameron, “A man servant who formerly belonged to my mother is about to be sold, and has applied me to buy him [...] I am particularly desirous of purchasing him [...] But a good male servant in my establishment, is indispensable ...” (series: 1.3.3, box: 43, folder: 1023, date: 1847-12-28, pp 1 - 2). Frances is telling Duncan that this man should be both purchased and valued. Lest we assume that this is merely begging for a new possession, we must remember that this slave to be purchased is another human. The Cameron family is aware of their feelings, as we can tell from accounts written by both Duncan and Paul. Duncan is less affectionate towards the slaves, but he still ascribes to them an ability to carry emotion.","This question of duality of impressions from the Cameron family, leads one to an idea that can be referenced as casual affection. This idea is one that allows for both the poor treatment of slaves in a dominant owner situation, and the ability to regard them as thinking feeling beings. A good analogy might be the dog sled team. The driver of the sled pushes his dogs hard and makes them work under difficult conditions, but at the same time is anxious that they should be healthy and well cared for.","As we see with Frances, this idea plays itself out in a way that is strange to our modern ear. On one hand, this relative of Duncan is anxious to purchase the slave instead of another person buying the same man. This may indicate a sense of attachment. The man had previously belonged to Frances' mother, so there is a sense of familial connection with the servant. At the same time, the letter begins a discussion of the price with Duncan, negotiating almost as if this were a plaything of great interest. On the other hand, this is someone bartering for the life of another man. The letter tells us that this particular slave can be had for $550, instead of the regular asking price of $700, a difference of $150. Quibbling over the price of something has a very demeaning connotation. Imagine if you were getting ready to go to an amusement park with your family, and the decision maker of that trip decided that you were not worth the $150 it would require for you to join the family? How would you feel? What would you think, if you knew that $150 was greater than your determined value?","Beyond all this, Frances' desire to acquire this slave is so great that a letter to Duncan is warranted. We do not know exactly who Frances is. We know there was a Frances recorded in the 1880's, but this Duncan would most likely be a fairly young man when writing this letter in 1847. Are these two Frances Camerons the same person? The only thing we know for certain is that Frances expected Duncan to be surprised at receiving a letter asking for money.","As it stands, it does not make sense that Frances would have either affection or dominant ownership of this servant, but the idea of casual affection allows for both feelings of affection and feelings of ownership, without degrading either concept."],"display_date":"December 28, 1847","search_date":"1847-12-28","locations":[{"id":9683,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":455,"tag":"Plantation Life"},{"id":400,"tag":"Cameron family"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4959,"title":"Sojourner Truth asks \"Ain't I a Woman?\"","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1851, Sojourner Truth stood in front of the Women's Convention in Ohio, looking over the numerous white faces, and asked the crowd “Ain’t I a woman?”. In the speech that followed, Truth challenged the idea that men should treat all women the same, “That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place, and ain't I a woman?” Truth wanted to challenge the idea and the general understanding of a “woman” and womanhood to the conference. She believed the term should expand to include black women. She believed that every woman deserved to be treated with respect by men of all color no matter the color of the women’s skin.","Sojourner Truth also known as Isabella Baumfree was an African American woman and a slave. She was a young teenager who was sold to John D. Dumont. Seventeen years later, Isabella escaped Dumont’s control and became a runaway slave. After traveling family to family for two years, she found herself in New York City. The Anti-Slavery Act, that was passed, allowed Truth to be free. She was able to sue her former owner for selling her son into slavery. In 1843, Isabella changed her name to Sojourner Truth and preached in New England about women’s rights and slavery.  Later on in her life she helped other slaves find freedom and success in society. Generally women who were forced into slavery at an early age did not have an education, Truth helped the women learn how to succeed in the outside world. Black women in society were seen with little respect and a low social status. Twenty years after Truth’s moving speech, historians felt “the silence had been broken and the veil was raised to reveal the long obscured and ignored activism and experiences of one half of the black population in America”[1]. When historians look back on Sojourner Truth’s speech, they realize she stated a radical idea for the mid 1800’s because she proposed and questioned why black women were not treated with the same respect as white women."," ","[1] Clark Hine, Darlene. \"Ar'n't I A Woman?: Female Slaves In the Plantation South-Twenty Years After.\" (2007): 14."," "],"display_date":"1850 - 1860","search_date":"1855-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":582,"tag":"Ain't I a Woman?"},{"id":581,"tag":"Anti-Slavery Act"},{"id":580,"tag":"Sojourner Truth"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History: New York, New York","school":"Stonehill College","course_id":27,"school_id":22}},{"id":4976,"title":"Calhoun Foreshadows Two Nations","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-02-06","end_date":"1832-02-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 6, 1837, John C.

After acknowledging an anti-abolition meeting that had taken place in the town just a few days prior, the anonymous author of the front-page article went on to denounce the meeting as foolish and to predict the gradual alienation between the North and South, until the point where the South no longer wanted anything to do with the Union. To this anonymous author the separation between the North and the South seemed almost inevitable; South Carolina had already expressed desire for independence in the Nullification Crisis in 1832 and the South, with the preference for states’ rights over federal ones, was already uncomfortable with the North having so much power. It became clear that the author hoped to garner support for the abolitionist movement in defaming its opposition; the meeting, the author asserted, was a “farce” populated by “third-rate lawyers” who were attempting to fight an impossible battle in Geneva. With no economic connections to the South, residents of Geneva saw no reason to support the anti-abolition movement.","The issue concerning states’ rights and the extent of states’ powers in relation to the Federal government dates as far back as the Articles of Confederation which gave states a great deal of power; a more powerful Federal government was eventually instituted, though the arguments over the rights of the states continued. This issue became a core concept in the discussions of slavery in the South, where intellectuals, politicians, and plantation owners defended its position in the Southern economy. The United States had not yet faced the possibility of adding more slave states to the Union, but the precedent was tested in 1819. Just fifteen years prior to the anti-abolition front’s meeting in Geneva the United States had become embroiled in disagreements over the introduction of new slave states after the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory, which exacerbated the animosity between the North and South. The Missouri Crisis constituted one of the first open clashes concerning slavery and states’ rights: the debate centered around the creation of a new state, Missouri, as a slave state. Prominent Northern politicians such as Rufus King violently opposed this idea and fought against Missouri’s admittance as a broadening of Southern slavery. Eventually a compromise was reached, allowing Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state and Maine as a free one. This compromise only served to delay the eventual confrontation even further, and allowed for problems to continue to surface between the abolitionists in the North and slaveholders in the

the midst of the Civil War, one woman remained behind the scenes of the battlefield documenting the war and experiencing the fighting first hand.  Belle Edmondson kept a diary from January to November of 1864 in which she detailed occurrences in West Tennessee such as the Union and Confederate battles, tragic accidents of friends, visitations by friends and family, travel to various southern cities, and everyday occurrences such as meals and church.  Edmondson’s primary role during the war was that of an intelligence gatherer, courier, and contraband smuggler for the Southern troops.  Edmondson's wartime experiences occurred on land controlled by neither Union nor Confederate soldiers.","Within Edmondson’s vast collection of journal entries, she described with great detail the fighting she witnessed and her desire for the Confederates to disarm and capture the Northern forces.  As a hero of the Confederacy, she wrote on April 13 of heavy firing between Fort and Gun boats and the fifteen Union soldiers who arrived and forced Edmondson to feed their horses.  Shortly afterwards, the soldiers stole some of those horses.  Her attitude in the diary shifted on Saturday, April 16 when she wrote of the arrival of thirty Union soldiers, six of which dined over breakfast with her.  She described them as gentlemen and expressed her surprise at finding their company pleasing to dine with.","While Belle's experience with Union forces shifted from inconvenient to tolerable, Stephen Ash described in his book \"When the Yankees Came: Conflict and Chaos in the Occupied South\" that many southerners experienced \"shock, confusion [and] panic\" at the incoming Federal soldiers.  Ash explained that much of this terror, as experienced by Belle when they arrive on her property, was \"often aggravated by uncertainty about the enemy's exact location and intentions.  With communications disrupted and facts scarce, rumors flourished.\"  A native of Edmondson's home state of Tennessee, Nimrod Porter described his fear at the Union's arrival in February of 1862 when he stated, \"The awful state of affairs, and the greate uncertainty of events, & the suspense is truly almost too much for me to beare.\"  Many throughout the south lived in panic over the presence of Union forces and had to live among fear of their unknown locations.","Two days later on April 18, Edmondson received another visit from Memphis Union soldiers and expressed her disgust over one of them who was a black abolitionist, indicating Edmondson's hostility toward those enslaved.  Throughout the many issues discussed in Edmondson’s diary, her vocal expressions of racism and detailed account of the fighting express the real feelings and anger experienced by those living in south during the Civil War.  Obviously in favor of Confederate forces and vocally against the actions of the Union, toward the end of her diary, Belle wrote on August 29, 1864 of her excitement for General Lee with his victory in Virginia.  While her enthusiasm ebbs and flows with the changing actions of the soldiers on both sides, the constant hatred and corruption radiated throughout the south, and her account allows us to witness southerner’s trials and tribulations throughout the Civil War."," "],"display_date":"January

the 1830s a young South Carolina preacher and slaveholder delivered a sermon that justified the institution of slavery in America within the realms of Christianity.  Years later, a reverend in Cincinnati gave a sermon about his endeavor to find proof of the injustices of slavery and the rightful backing of abolitionism through Christianity.  Both of these preachers were able to find justification for their own personal and political beliefs within the Bible, but that is not uncommon today.  What is unique is that both of these men were, in fact the same individual, Reverend W.H. Brisbane.","Reverend W.H. Brisbane began his life as a fairly unremarkable young white male in southern nineteenth-century America.

teachings and ignoring the pro-abolitionist literature that he came across, Brisbane underwent what he refers to as a moral awakening in which he saw the \"error of his ways.\"  He immediately freed

anti-slavery.","This issue of religion being used as justification for slavery, secession, and eventually war is a prominent issue in nineteenth-century America and it is fascinating how one man can at one point or another be a champion for both sides of a polar issue.  <em>American Abolitionists</em> by Stanley Harrold outlines how abolitionist movements generally started as radical, northern institutions but as information and social consciousness grew, more and more moderates began to join the anti-slavery clause.  It was abolitionist literature that originated in the north that played a vital role in Brisbane's own self-examination.  This moment of contingency in American history, where moderates, religious leaders, and even some former slaveowners gave their support for abolitionism had far reaching effects throughout the rest of the nineteenth century."],"display_date":"February 12,

years of meetings focused on the business of dealing with church members who struggled with drunkenness or loose morals, the minutes of the Turkey Creek Baptist Church took a fairly drastic turn into the nineteenth century, showing records of meetings now consumed with the granting of fellowship to slaves.  Almost every entry in the mid-nineteenth century included some account of “a woman of colour belonging to…” or “a man of colour” coming forward to relate his or her “travels” and “after an examination the Church recieved” the new member.  Expanding Christianity to all people, including slaves, is no cause for question or concern, but the suddenness of the matter is one fact worth questioning.","In the mid 1800s, the Civil War was imminent and growing abolitionist sentiment throughout the nation was apparent.  Slaveholders in the South were ever under scrutiny, but the Christian slaveholders wanted to clarify their objectives.  As Christian masters it was their duty to be just and convey to their slaves that the authority was delegated to them by God.  Evangelicals had to “redefine the scope and shape” of their responsibility when “routed in their battles with slavery.” This “Mission to Slaves” exemplified the Evangelical ethic of slaveholders, reinforcing their belief and outward claim that slavery was an effort to convert African-Americans because neither the civil nor “social condition affected the need for salvation or the responsibility to provide it.”  This Mission did not reach maturity until around 1830, but Methodist and Baptist churches in the South had begun years earlier, hence the entries from the Turkey Creek Baptist Church dating as early as 1822.","In short, when skepticism and disapproval of slavery grew, those who believed they were serving a higher purpose were forced to defend themselves.  By increasing slave membership to their churches, Southern Evangelical slave owners were able to provide those who doubted with evidence of their cause."],"display_date":1822,"search_date":"1822-07-02","locations":[{"id":11416,"lat":34.1679782338,"lng":-82.3756180087,"zoom":9,"place":"ABBEVILLE, South

Doane remembers the hard work that had to be done on her South Carolina plantation while her father was away at war.  Though they never saw any Yankees, Confederate soldiers were frequent guests at the Cumming’s home.  Ragged and half-starved, these desperate soldiers took full liberties to raid their provisions, passing in hordes and killing their chickens.  Mrs. Cummings, however, did not deny the ravenous soldiers food. ","One of eleven children, Mrs. Doane (young Miss Cummings) lived with her family on a 3000 acre plantation in the low country of South Carolina at the fork of the Salkehatchie River.  When word came late one afternoon that her father was among the Confederate soldiers who were passing through Salkehatchie but could not get away to visit his family, it took her mother no time to make plans.  After giving her children their supper, she laid mattresses in the big covered wagon and put them to bed under the care of the faithful slave “Mudder.”  A slave drove the wagon as Mrs. Cummings drove the buggy with a baby in her lap and her eldest son at her side.  The experience of seeing her father and camping with the other families who had come to see their husbands and fathers was a thrilling memory that Mrs. Doane never forgot.","In addition to bravely carrying her family out to meet her husband, Mrs. Cummings also heroically saved the family cotton supply.  Mr. Cummings had left the gin house full of cotton when he went off to war, and many of their neighbors were also endowed with large supplies of cotton.  Upon hearing that the Yankees were coming, the neighbors decided to burn all the cotton rather than give the enemy of the pleasure of raiding their stores.  When they tried to persuade Mrs. Cummings to do likewise, she replied that there was nothing she could do about it if the Yankees came and burned the cotton, but until that time, she would keep her cotton right where it was.  Surprisingly, the Yankees never came, and Mrs. Cummings saved the cotton which would prove very profitable to the family in the years following the war.","The nation’s sudden emergence into the Civil War immediately transformed the South.  The role of women grew vastly to include all of the responsibilities of men, as their husbands were away at war.  At least at the beginning of the war, the romance of the military and its association with honor, courage, and glory was able to outweigh the reluctance of women to see their husbands leave them in charge at home.  Women were rudely awakened from their effeminate habits and learned not to privilege their personal interests.  All southerners seemed to realize that if the South were to survive, women had to be patriotic and assume the political interests of men.  As the self-sacrifice of women for their loved ones gradually turned into the self-sacrifice <em>of</em> their loved ones, women were faced with a conflict between patriotism and protectiveness.  Many women cared more deeply about their men than about the abstract cause of patriotism, and some broke down when the struggles of the war became too much for them.  The experiences of southern women during the Civil War were vast and varied, but many heroines such as Mrs. Cummings rose up to defend the cause of patriotism that was steeped in the desire to assist their husbands in any way possible."],"display_date":"May -

being purchased as a slave at ten years old, forced to relocate from Virginia to Alabama, and required to endure hours of hard labor and beatings.  This was the life of Walter Calloway, born in 1848 in Richmond, Virginia.  At the age of 10, Calloway was bought by slave master John Calloway whose plantation resided just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.  As he sat on a porch outside his home answering questions, he recalled the strenuous labor he performed at the tender age of ten, along with his mother and brother.  His master, who was often cruel to their slaves, was bearable and fed him well, but it was the overseer named “Green Bush” and African-American named Mose who performed the mistreatment to Walter and others.  Walter described the torture when he said, “Green Bush what sho’ whup us iffen we don’t do to suit him.  Yassuh, he mighty rough wid us be he didn’t do de whippin’ hisse’f.”  He continued to describe the beating of a fifteen-year-old girl that almost killed her.","As his labor took the majority of his time, Walter and the other slaves were deprived of schooling.  They were required to go to the school and take care of the white children at times, and he then stated the white men eventually all joined the Army, as was expected of them.  After the Civil War, Walter described the lack of action on the plantation except for “gangs of so’jers passin’ th’ough gwine off to de war.”  Confederate soldiers would pass through and take some of their food for the soldier’s rations.","Then the United States soldiers arrived on the plantation and he was told to warn Mrs. Freeman but before he returned the Union soldiers had wrecked havok on the plantation.  They destroyed the smoke house, hams, and the remainder of the rations.  He had heard they also burned cotton plantations and steamboats harbored in Montgomery.  Shortly after the war, Walter was freed but he was quick to state that “we ain’t nebber been what I calls free.”  He and the other slaves had no money and all were scattered in various different locations.  He ended his interview as he asked for help back into the house.","In the article “North American Slave Narratives” William Andrews described the importance of studying the narratives of slaves during the nineteenth century to better understand the time period, and the issues happening during their lives.  In addition, “the autobiographical narratives of former slaves comprise one of the most extensive and influential traditions in African American literature and culture”.  While the narratives provide excellent historical documents, they also helped bridge relationships between Africa-Americans and whites after the war, allowing for whites to begin to understand the repression the African-Americans had faced.","The narratives such as Walter’s will be used for generations in the future in order to attempt to grasp some sort of understanding about this troubling period in American history.  Charles L. Perdue provided his view of the importance of slave narratives in his book “Weevils in the Wheat: interviews with Virginia ex-slaves” when he said “Though most historians have not utilized the ex-slave interviews in the past, there is a growing realization that prior histories have been one-sided on the subject of slavery and that the slaves’ view of the institution is essential to round out the picture\".  The first-hand account of the period is invaluable to historians and students alike and he further explained, “the ex-slave interviews provide us with insights into Afro-American culture that are not obtainable from other sources”.  Stories like Walter Calloway’s must continue to be shared and studied to shed further light on their troubles and the tribulations they worked to overcome.","Walter’s narrative not only described the horrible mistreatment of slaves, but the lack of the value of African-American lives during the nineteenth century.  They were purchased as commodities and forced to work hard labor as young as ten years old.  Although Walter and his mother and brother were able to stay together, this was often not the case and most families were separated and spread throughout the country."," "],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":300,"lat":32.2508016784,"lng":-86.1660804753,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5055,"title":"<em>Reverend L.

The story of slavery and the lives of the surviving slaves still effects America today. The personal recollection of their stories some years later, allowed for all Americans to peer into the lives of slaves and see what it was like to be a slave. Although, not everyone got to tell their story, there are lots of recollections that allow Americans to learn about the various types of slaves and slave owners. One of the slaves that recounted his life was Reverend L. Ferebee in his twenty four page autobiography.","One of the specific episodes in Ferebee’s book recounts the selling of his mother. Ferebee remembers his master selling his mother when he was just a few years old. He describes in full the catastrophic day his mother was sold. One can feel the pain and anguish that young Ferebee felt when seeing his mother that day. He recounts the story of why his master decided to sell his mother. The Reverend explains how aggressive his mother was. Mrs.Ferebee did not like following directions and was a rebel. Her mistress tried to hit her one day and she fought back. When the master came home, instead of beating her for disobeying, he decided to just sell her and avoid the drama. Ferebee discusses how he was also sold along with his mother and two of his siblings. This was considerate of his master because most slave children were separated from their mothers when sold off. But, his second master leased him off when he was a young teenager for about a year because he no longer needed his services. When Ferebee returns he is surprised to find that his mother has once again been sold. This time he has no idea where to find his family and feels alone and depressed.","The twenty-four page autobiography of Reverend Ferebee demonstrates the effects, of slavery. Textbook accounts of slavery fail to teach us that the thirteenth amendment did not simply solve all of the pain and hurt the families underwent. Slavery separated several families and it tore young children from their mothers. When discussing slavery most people speak of the pain that slaves underwent when working out in the fields such as being expected to pick between 100 to 200 pounds of cotton and when being beat by their masters. But, they rarely speak of the emotional pain they went through.

Extra! Read all about it! Newspaper supports illiteracy!” This confusing fictional phrase would have been the perfect attention grabber for The Confederate Baptist, a southern newspaper that did just that.  In its second ever publication, The Confederate Baptist included a column on its front page entitled “Teaching our Slaves to Read.”  The newspaper largely served as a religious tool of education during the years of the American Civil War and thus hardly an issue was released that did not romanticize the war effort, justify the traditions of the South (particularly slavery) or attempt to instill the virtues of the Confederacy.","<br /> In this particular piece, the editors of the paper dealt with the tension between their Christian basis and slave-owning readers.  While numerous issues of the newspaper presented different versions of religious based justifications for slavery, here the issue was about teaching slaves about the Bible.  The spreading of the Gospel was fundamental to the Baptist belief system but actively teaching slaves to read and write presented a real threat to the institution of slavery and was in fact illegal in both Georgia and South Carolina in 1862.  Luckily the contributors of The Confederate Baptist found a loophole that allowed them, in their minds, to uphold both traditions of slavery and Christianity.  The column states that “the reading of the Scriptures is not essential to the salvation of our slaves.  Faith cometh by hearing, and all the benefits of revelation may be communicated to them by what has always been the great means of conversion, the preaching of the Word.  Oral communication has ever been God’s chosen method of saving sinners.”","<br /> In her book, When I can Read My Title Clear, Janet Duitsman Cornelius examines this issue of “Bible Slavery.”  While literacy was certainly not common among slaves, some slave-owners did advocate the education of their slaves, to varying degrees and for varying reasons.  One slave-owner recalled that it was advantageous to him to have slaves that could read but not write, thus education was simply pragmatic in nature.  Other slave-owners decided to educate their slaves in opposition to a central government telling them what they could and could not do with their “property”.  Other Christians felt that personal reading and understanding of the Bible was essential to salvation and therefore taught their slaves to read.  In none of these cases, however, does one find a true sympathy for the situation for the slaves beyond religious ideologies and therefore education is never brought to the slaves in the South that would lead to a potential improvement of their situation."],"display_date":"October 8, 1862","search_date":"1862-10-08","locations":[{"id":11638,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":445,"tag":"Education for blacks"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5084,"title":"The Price of Slavery","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-02","end_date":"1847-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["To a group of slaves about to be sold to a new owner, the future is uncertain. Their new home may promise decent food and board, or it may mean the separation from their closest family members, abusive overseers, and grueling work that drives them to the brink of death. This is what thirteen slaves faced when they were sold on January 2, 1847 by John D. McCullough to Samuel W. Evans. The document promised their ownership by Evans until their death or his, at which time his heirs would take further ownership of any surviving slaves. In addition, McCullough promises in the contract that he will defend the ownership by Evans of these people against any person who claims otherwise. The insights these provide into antebellum Southern society are many.","The fact that McCullough includes his defense of ownership in the contract shows us the state of the Southern economy at this time. Slaves made up a majority of the livelihood, providing the region with the largest portion of its economic output. Runaways could be a problem, but those recaptured were returned to their owners. However, there is the chance that, like any other form of property, dishonest men could capture the runaway slaves and call them their own. The inclusion of a witness to the sale of slaves in Evans’ contract shows how important it was to protect their means of an income, all the way until and through their death, guaranteeing their children and families a way to continue making money as well. This also provides another possibility. In the case that a slave runs away and is found among abolitionists, a slave owner would have the proof needed to show that the man or woman had escaped and, according to the later Fugitive Slave Act, had to be returned to his or her rightful owner.","In addition, it is important to note the price that these men and women sold for. The total amount for the slaves was listed as $5,300 – about $408 per slave. This was less than large slave markets, such as those in New Orleans, where slaves could go for up to $1,200, but the fact that this was a private sale means more bargaining was involved. However, this leads to another problem; slaves were hyperaware of their value as a commodity. At the war’s end, when these people were looking for work in labor as free agents, they would ask for the same prices that they had garnered before the war; however, white plantation owners were unwilling to pay such prices, leaving both ends in a poor position: the newly freed blacks without work, and the whites without labor to work their fields. The Southern economy would be destroyed for years to come as both groups of people struggled to make sense of their new situations."],"display_date":"January 2, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-02","locations":[{"id":11495,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":768,"tag":"Prices"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5092,"title":"Is Divorce a Northern Thing","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["J.D.B De Bow printed one of the most widely circulated southern agricultural chronicles of the 1800’s; the purpose of the journal was to bolster the South and the region’s economy.

The court case brought up hard questions about slavery within the United States of America and challenged the slavery laws between the northern states and the southern states.","The events that inspired the Lemmon case began in 1852 when the Lemmon family and eight of their African American slaves traveled from the state of Virginia, where slavery was legal at the time, to the state of New York, where slavery was illegal. While the Lemmon family and their slaves were in New York City, an African American man named Louis Napoleon found the slaves owned by the Lemmon family and determined that they were being held against their will. This was illegal within New York City. So, Napoleon went to the Superior Court of New York City and filed a writ of habeas corpus, which is Latin for \"that you have the body,\" for the African American slaves. On November 6, 1852, Justice Elijah Paine granted the writ of habeas corpus for the slaves, which required Lemmon to produce his slaves before the court.","The <em>New York Times</em> article from January 24, 1860 discussed the plaintiffs’ points of argument before the Court of Appeals in the Lemmon Slave Case. The plaintiffs’ lawyer Mr. Charles O’Connor first pointed out that New York State could not forbid slavery because it was not illegal in the United States. In 1860, the Constitution of the United States did not yet have an amendment making slavery illegal. O’Conner next noted that the Judicial Department of New York State has no right to declare African American slavery illegal contrary to the law of nature. Finally, he argued that New York State could not prevent citizens of sister states, where slavery was legal, from passing through New York.","A follow-up article in the <em>New York Times</em>, dated January 26, 1860, addressed the counterarguments of the Counsel of New York, Mr. William M. Evarts. Evarts responded to O’Conner’s arguments before the court. The first point was that every human being within the state of New York was entitled to the writ of habeas corpus. The second point was that the relationship between slave owner and slave did not continue from Virginia to New York then Texas. The third and final point his argument was that travelers are bounded by the laws of the state in which they reside, no matter whether they stay one day or several years.","The State of New York Court of Appeals made its decision on the Lemmon case in March 1860. The Judges ruled 5-3 in favor of the African American slaves. One of the majority opinions was written by Judge Denio. In his opinion Denio said that some cases concerning the Commerce Clause would be able to protect slavery as property when dealing with interstate commerce but this case was not one of them. The Commerce Clause is part of the Constitution of the United States that allows the federal government to regulate interstate commerce so there is no wrong doing between states. Another member of the majority, Justice Wright, stated that the United States Constitution denied any power affecting slavery, which does not involve the Fugitive Slave Clause. This clause requires that slaves that escaped to another state to be returned back to the owner in the state from which they escaped.","The judges who favored the Lemmon family were Justices Clarke, Comstock, and Selden. Justice Clarke stated that citizens of other states traveling through New York State must be allowed to pass through with their property even if the property includes slaves. Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden also “expressed a concern at the violation of comity and justice in interstate relations wrought by the New York statue” [1]. Following the New York decision the Lemmon family appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Before the United States Supreme Court could hear the case the US Civil War started in April 1861. Then in September 1862 President Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation which freed all slaves in the United States.","In conclusion, the <em>New York Times </em>article from January 24, 1860 provides fascinating insights into the legal issues affecting slavery and interstate travel before the Civil War. This court case was part of the final stage in the United States history that triggered the Civil War and made all Americans free no matter where they came from and what color their skin was."," ","_________________","[1] Gordan, III, John D. \"The Lemmon Slave Case.\" The Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York, 2006: 1, 12."],"display_date":"January - March 1860","search_date":"1860-02-14","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":858,"tag":"habeas corpus"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":857,"tag":"Lemmon Case"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5147,"title":"In this episode, a historical essay titled The Underground Railroad by Levi Coffin is described.

In order to be successful, slaves needed the shelter, food, and safety of various abolitionists who were sympathetic to their cause. For the slaves, the long journey was anything but easy, but those who helped them along the way faced their own challenges. In his 1850 essay titled <em>The Underground Railroad</em>, Levi Coffin chronicles the trials and tribulations of operating a safe house for slaves.","Levi Coffin, known as the president of the Underground Railroad, successfully helped thousands of slaves escape to freedom. Born and raised in North Carolina during the early 1800’s, Coffin was exposed to the horrors of slavery at an early age. It was here that he developed his overwhelming sympathy towards the oppression and injustice of blacks. With his parents and grandparents opposed to the institution of slavery, Levi was encouraged to be compassionate towards the slaves. In fact, Coffin and a cousin started a school that taught blacks to read by using the Bible. Unfortunately, disgruntled slave-owners forced the school to be shutdown In 1824, Coffin and his wife Catherine moved to Newport (now known as Fountain City), Indiana. It is here that he established a successful merchant business and became an integral part of a truly humanitarian effort.","As a man of strong faith, Coffin believed strongly that it was his moral duty to help the slaves along their journey to freedom.  He was heavily ridiculed by members of his community and urged to think about the possible devastating consequences to his family and business. As noted in his essay, Coffin responded to his critics by explaining, “if by doing my duty and endeavoring to fulfill the injunctions of the Bible, I injured my business, then let my business go. As to my safety, my life was in the hands of my Divine Master, and I felt that I had his approval. I had no fear of the danger that seemed to threaten my life or my business. If I was faithful to duty, and honest and industrious I felt that I would be preserved, and that I could make enough to support my family” [1].  With strong conviction, Coffin continued to keep his home open to the Underground Railroad. Slaves would arrive unannounced, typically in the middle of the night. They were taught that a hitching post out front signified a safe house. From here, Coffin and his wife would prepare the slaves for their travel to the next stop along the route. The slaves were accommodated with food, clothing, and a place to rest. Then, Coffin explains, in the darkness of night, he would lead the group of slaves along the secret, and dangerous path. He acknowledges that the chance of getting caught by bounty hunters and their bloodhounds was very real. In fact, Thomas Garrett, a fellow abolitionist in Wilmington, Delaware was arrested and fined $5,400 for housing slaves.","For over 20 years, Levi Coffin and his wife stayed committed to the fugitive slaves despite the possible repercussions and the arduous labor. In his essay, he describes the hardships, “the care of so many necessitated much work and anxiety on our part, but we assumed the burden of our own will and bore it cheerfully” [2].   Inspired by Coffin’s efforts, many of his neighbors, who once criticized him, began to become involved.  While many were still unwilling to house the slaves out of fear of persecution, most were willing to provide clothing and food. Through various publications, speeches, and action, Levi Coffin became a fearless crusader in the fight for the abolishment of slavery. By his courageous action, Coffin encouraged others to join in the effort to help slaves escape bondage."," "," ","[1] \"Levi Coffin\", The Underground Railroad, http://The National Center for Public Policy Research (http://www.nationalcenter.org/UndergroundRailroad.html).","[2] <em>Ibid</em>."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":3733,"lat":39.864392731,"lng":-85.009873998,"zoom":10,"place":"WAYNE, Indiana"}],"tags":[{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5154,"title":"The Changing Public Attitude towards Slavery","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-03-10","end_date":"1841-03-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the changes in the public mindset towards slavery had not yet been fully reinforced by law but the distaste with which other countries had viewed the institution for some time was clear.  Blatant racism was still plainly evident, yet the abolition movement was now growing and the public response to prejudice was now becoming very different.  After recent written accounts of slavery in the United States had been published by intellectuals such as Harriet Martineau and James Silk Buckingham, there were others from overseas taking on the voyage to the United States.  They wished to reveal and record what they saw about this young, powerful republic with such controversial politics at hand, in wonderment of the idealized American principles burdened so heavily by slavery’s contradiction of them, and to participate in the abolishment of the institution.","On March 10, 1841, one such voyage carrying many passengers of international backgrounds from Great Britain to America.  Joseph Sturge, an author and anti-slavery movement member, recalls how an inebriated British man, in calling to attention a waiter standing by, referred to him as “blackey”.  The waiter responded, “My name is Robert; when you want anything from me, please address me by my name; there is no gentleman on board who would have addressed me as you have done; we are all of the same flesh and blood; I did not make myself; God made me”.","His intoxication was of no excuse, and while many passengers on board indeed held their own opinions as to the lesser status of black men, it was also understood by the observers that there was not a man present, no matter their prejudices, who would have supported the initial offender against this much-deserved return. Sturge’s observations reflect that the passengers on the voyage to America could see the waiter as a man, much as themselves, and could not deny the accuracy of his response.  In decades earlier, few black men standing alone would have dared speak out without fear of immediate and unanimous reprisal, yet this was 1841, and here was a glimpse of the gradual but necessary progressions of the public outlook about slavery as an unacceptable institution.","Abolition-movement members such as the American brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan were working diligently towards their cause, an attempt to “ma[ke] the whole nation look the captives in the face”, as yet another overseas onlooker noted.   People were becoming uncomfortable with slavery and racism as it seemed uncivilized and sinful amongst developed men.  Author St. George Tucker noted how even in pursuit of  independence and the hope for a better life which the Americans had sought for themselves, somehow they had turned from the oppressed into the oppressors, and in many cases, much more viciously.","The traveling writers from overseas were being joined by many American intellectuals, such as Emerson and Thoreau amongst others, all pointed in their goal of revealing a changing attitude about slavery in the United States.  Developments in communication allowed this perspective to circulate more widely than ever possible before.  Many people now not only understood the institution of slavery but were faced with its details every day.  The cultivation of thought encouraged by publications seemed to require a new evolution in behavior."],"display_date":"March 10, 1841","search_date":"1841-03-10","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 -

In 1856, an Englishman, Frederick Law Olmstead, wrote <em>A journey in the seaboard slave states. </em>It is about his long journey in the seaboard slave states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana.  In the chapter on Virginia, Olmstead expresses an unforgettable experience: he saw the whole process of slaves being sent to the market for sale just like merchandise.  He went to the slave-market and asked for the price and information, witnessed the procedure of slave auction and bidding, and saw slaves forced to depart from their families.  He even saw a black slave only cost $2.50.","During this period, the slave companies were all legal, and this kind of commerce flourished: “I turned into a short, broad street, in which were a number of establishments, the signs on which indicated that they were occupied by ‘Slave Dealers,’ and that ‘Slaves, for Sale or to Hire,’ were to be found within them. They were much like Intelligence Offices, being large rooms partly occupied by ranges of forms, on which sat a few comfortably and neatly clad negroes, who appeared perfectly cheerful; each grinning obsequiously, but with a manifest interest or anxiety, when I fixed my eye on them for a moment,” Olmstead says. He describes that many colored people, adults and children, were being sold like merchandise as home-servants or field-workers.  They were forced to leave their families, but no one seemed to feel a thing; in the auction, Olmstead describes, “there was an entire absence of emotion in the party of men, women, and children, thus seated preparatory to being sold.” Afterwards, Olmstead tried to do some research on general views of slavery in its social and political relations, and he discovered that people were fairly satisfied as long as the slaves were better off – as he interviewed a farmer, he says, “But what can we do that is better? Our free negroes--and, I believe it is the same at the North as it is here--are a miserable set of vagabonds, drunken, vicious, worse off, it is my honest opinion, than those who are retained in slavery. I am satisfied, too, that our slaves are better off, as they are, than the majority of your free laboring classes at the North.”","On the other hand, Olmstead was shocked that even poor white people were more “privileged” than the black people and black slaves: they received higher wages than black people, and they refused to do the jobs that black people usually did.  “Their wages were from fifty cents to a dollar [a day], varying with the demand and individual capacities . . .  No white man would ever do certain kinds of work, and if you should ask a white man you had hired, to do such things, he would get mad and tell you he wasn't a nigger.” With that said, black people and slaves were totally oppressed by whites (even poor whites), which added more stresses and dejection to their lives.","Olmstead’s story surely illustrates the picture of the slave trade through outsider’s eyes, and he showed how common and acceptable the slave trade was in the 1850s. In 1863, Francis Fedric, who actually was a slave in Virginia and Kentucky, wrote a book named <em>Slave Life in Virginia and Kentucky,</em> which was about his life as a slave over fifty years, including slaves being bought and sold, the events of slave-market, and his slave life with his fellows.  In the text, he states, “My master has bought about 100 slaves . . . for my master, at the next slave-market, intended to purchase more slaves.” Fedric’s book depicts the reality of the slave trade and the frustration and distress that slaves had to confront."],"display_date":1856,"search_date":"1856-07-01","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":891,"tag":"Slave States"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5205,"title":"This episode discusses is a specific event that occurred due to the establishment of the Fugitive Slave Laws in the 1850s called the Jerry Rescue.","course_id":58,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-10-01","end_date":"1851-10-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William “Jerry” Henry was a Missouri slave during this time period.

However, once the paper entered into the South, Garrison began to receive various threats to his life.","According to author Nick Fauchald, in Columbia, South Carolina, there was a $1,500 reward posted by the Vigilance Committee for the capture of any persons who had possession of <em>The Liberator</em>, and there were other cities that passed laws forbidding the paper to even leave the post office. In Raleigh, North Carolina, it was threatened that Garrison would be thrown in jail if he ever entered into the city; and the Georgia House of Representatives passed a bill which offered a $5,000 reward for anyone who captured Garrison and brought him to court. Garrison, however, did not take these threats seriously claiming that they were “free publicity” and boasted, “My language will displease many. To displease them is my intent.”","By publishing these threatening letters in his own newspaper, Garrison showed that he was not afraid, but instead used them to demonstrate that he was unwavering. Despite these letters, and hundreds more like them, Garrison was not deterred from his cause. In reality, Garrison and his supporters became even more devoted to their anti-slavery cause, which contradicted the intended effect of the Southern writers."],"display_date":"January 1, 1831 - February 15, 1839","search_date":"1835-01-23","locations":[{"id":6207,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5341,"title":"The <em>Freedmen’s Record </em>Reports on the Prosperity of Freedmen","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-10-01","end_date":"1865-10-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to the <em>Freedmen’s Record</em> report, many southerners perceived freedmen as “a hopelessly lazy, sensual creature who, if he has enough to satisfy the lowest animal wants, will be content.” They feared that freedmen would resort to theft instead of working to fulfill their needs.  The<em> Record</em> attempted to change these perceptions by exposing the tremendous success of freed African Americans in the North.  This is observed when the <em>Record </em>stated, “the amount of crime committed by this class of persons is much less than that committed by white men.”","The <em>Freedmen’s Record </em>was a monthly publication by the New England Freedman’s Aid Society, which worked to point out the hard work and success of many freedmen.  In the October 1865 issue, the statistical research of Dr. J. McCune Smith received considerate attention.  Smith,the first African American to receive a medical degree, found through his research that African Americans invested over eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars in New York, Brooklyn, and Williamsburg combined.  In New York City and Brooklyn alone, African Americans were said to have nearly five million dollars in property, while in Detroit, they had three hundred thousand dollars and “are excluded from the best public schools, which they, in common with their white fellow-citizens, are taxed to support.”  The same could be said for Washington, D.C., whereas in Philadelphia, nearly four hundred and fifty African American children attended public schools and fifty were students at universities in Albany or Oberlin.","The <em>Record </em>also detailed the hardships of freedmen,contributing the lack of success to:  the limited opportunities in certain areas, little to no schooling, and that some businesses would simply not hire blacks.  Even with such disadvantages, “The proportion of Irish paupers in Massachusetts, a year or two ago, to the whole Irish population, was one in one hundred and thirty-one,” while the ratio for African Americans was only “one in one hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and twenty-six.”  Even though the African Americans should have been at a much greater disadvantage than the white Irish population, they had similar proportions for a poor population.","The financial success of northern African Americans proved their ability to adapt to a freed lifestyle and obtain more than basic necessities.  In many cities, they contributed thousands of dollars to their schools and churches.  The <em>Freedmen’s Record</em> attempted to brush away fears of an inability to adapt in hopes that “they are admitted to all the privileges of freedmen!”"],"display_date":"October 1865","search_date":"1865-10-16","locations":[{"id":6210,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5372,"title":"Horrible experiences slaves endure in the 1800's","course_id":80,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-02-06","end_date":"1839-02-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The experience of slavery for men, women, and children was equally horrible. The amount of labor on the plantation farms was the same for both genders. The differences between the genders were the jobs appointed to them. Men were usually appointed jobs that included certain skill like carpentry and blacksmith. Women were usually working in the fields or as house servants. Accordening to Hallam, “For black men and women, slavery was an equally devastating experience. Both were torn from homeland and family. Both were forced to perform grueling labor, subjected to mental and physical degradation, and denied their most basic rights. Enslaved men and women were beaten mercilessly, separated from loved ones arbitrarily, and, regardless of sex, treated as property in the eyes of the law.\" When both genders worked in the fields, men were assigned to do the more physical tasks of plowing the fields and the women had the less physical job of hoeing the crops.","Slaves were allowed to have families, but the owners ultimately had control on what the families did with their lives. Mothers and their young were often separated. Ebenezer Davies observed many horrors, “She had at her breast an infant boy three months old. The slaver did not want the child on any terms. The master sold the mother, and retained the child.\" Usually, babies that were born on the farms became the property of the masters. Hallam explained, “The average enslaved woman at this time gave birth to her first child at nineteen years old, and thereafter, bore one child every two and a half years. This cycle, encouraged by the master, was not without benefits to the mother\" The pregnancies of the slaves insured their masters an efficient production cycle of slaves.","When men and women were auctioned, they were both treated like animals.

There was a resentment at the Union for the acceptance of the escaped slaves, whom some had been undertaken as labor to the Union forces. \"Contraband\" described former escaped slaves due to the fact that the Union would not return them to their former masters. One of the main motivators of guerrilla warfare during the Civil War was the issue of slavery. When Lincoln issued his emancipation policy and asked the border states to also end slavery, the possibility of slavery coming to an end provoked extreme frustration in Missouri. As the Federal troops began to enter the Border States they encountered Confederate troops and meet resistance bands of irregular soldiers or guerrillas. There were many different groupings of guerrilla warfare; bushwhacker, jayhawker, and partisan. There was guerrilla warfare taking place on the North and South sides, with this being said, it depended where your loyalties lay whether you were a jayhawker, bushwhacker, or a partisan. Jayhawkers were anti-slavery fighting guerrilla soliders, bushwhackers were bands of irregular fighters who hid in dense locations of vegatation in prepration for ambush, and partisans were calvary soldiers who were smart and performed dashing raids on Union troops. Sometimes the bushwhacker had no loyalties to either the North or South and was committing atrocious acts just to be vindictive. Their basic goals were to cause terror, rape, rob, and vandalize the local communities.","     The Smoky Hill and Republican Union Paper in Junction City, Kansas describes how the bushwhackers were strategic in their attack, taking prisoners by name and even knowing where the seventy-six former slaves were being kept on the boat. The attack was led by guerrilla leader George Todd who served under the well-known William Quantrill. The “assassins” took over the boat and also they robbed the passengers of thousands of dollars of personal belongings and money. They also destroyed government property such as freight and employed some of the passengers to help them. The passengers were willing to help if meant to save their lives. Unfortunately not all the passengers met such a fate. The bushwhackers took the “contrabands”, marched them off the boat and lined them up in a row. The paper describes as these “poor, helpless creatures” were shot and fifteen fell dead. Thirteen former slaves did get did away as the men proceeded to go back to pillaging the Sam Gaty but the paper states that later remainder of the “contraband” was killed by these \"inhuman monsters\". (What the paper fails to state is if there were seventy-six contrabands on the Sam Gaty, and fifteen were killed, why does the Smoky Hill Republican Union only headline that fifteen were killed?)","     In any case the Smoky Hill and Republican Union paper does state that this appalling act was certainly one of the worst and would evoke revenge. This was a savage attack on the people of this steamboat and the Union. These bushwhackers, who generally did not take sides on the war, made a major statement with the assassination of these former slaves with ties to the Union. However their main goal was to cause fear and confusion for the opposing troops, and they accomplished that with their attack of the Sam Gaty. The civil unrest in these communities of border states, especially Missouri, during the Civil War was of a large scale, and caused serious turmoil between neighbors and authorities. According to guerrilla warfare historian, Richard Brownlee, the turmoil was also in regards to Missouri’s frustration at being portrayed to Northerners as potential secessionists and parts on North Missouri the state was in \"near anarchy\" because of the increasing strain of conflict. It was difficult for local and state governments to handle the raging situation with guerrilla warfare. Brownlee notes in certain areas of Missouri that some communities disintegrated entirely due to the violence of guerrilla activity. These bands of irregular fighters were motivated and difficult to control and their reputation outlasts them even today."," "],"display_date":"April 4, 1863","search_date":"1863-04-04","locations":[{"id":7633,"lat":39.0084856397,"lng":-94.3460789427,"zoom":9,"place":"JACKSON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5554,"title":"Escape through Death: The Story of Fugitive Margaret Garner","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-01-27","end_date":"1856-01-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Deemed “a tale of horror” by <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em>, Margaret Garner, a fugitive slave, took the life of her child in order to save her from a life of slavery.  This is the story that Cincinnati woke up to on the morning of January 29, 1856.  Two nights earlier, sixteen slaves had escaped from Kentucky into Ohio, eight of whom included Garner and her family.  According to <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em>, the family had stolen horses and a sleigh from their owner, Mr. Marshall, and crossed the frozen river on the night of January 27. Once in Ohio, they sought refuge at a former slave’s home.","The fugitives’ owners arrived the next day searching for the runaways in order to take them back to Kentucky.  Because of The Fugitive Slave Act passed in 1850, they were able to obtain a warrant and the assistance of the local United States Marshal.  The act stated that it was the duty of marshals and deputy marshals to carry out the warrants.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> detailed the events that unfolded at the house where Garner and her family were hiding: shots were fired, a deputy marshal was injured, and the door was breached.  Upon entry into the house, they discovered the dead child.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> described the scene by saying, “a deed of horror had been consummated, for weltering in its blood, the throat being cut ear to ear and the head almost severed from the body, upon the floor lay one of the children of the younger couple, a girl three years old.”  Garner proceeded to hit the dead child with a shovel before being restrained.  At the time, it was unclear who had killed the child; <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> stated, “The fearful act lies between one or the other of the miserable parents, perhaps both, but doubtless, the truth will be brought out by the coroner to-day.”","Indeed, the truth was “brought out.”  Julius Yanuck, a historian, discusses the story in a journal article almost a century later.  When Garner discovered that they were about to be captured, she devised a desperate plan that would save her children from returning to slavery – escape through death.  Quickly she grabbed a knife and seized her three-year-old daughter.  Using the knife, she gashed open her daughter’s throat.  She then turned to her other children, but was stopped before she could manage to do more than mildly injure them.","Much agitation grew out of the escape and murder.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> summed up the article and captured the sense of tension by saying, “Abolitionists regard the parents of the murdered child as a hero and heroine, teeming with lofty and holy emotions, who, Virginiuslike would rather imbue their hands in the blood of their offspring than allow them to wear the shackles of slavery, while others look upon them as brutal and unnatural murderers.”  Whether selfish or selfless, the acts of Garner were not quickly forgotten."],"display_date":"January 27, 1856 - January 28, 1856","search_date":"1856-01-27","locations":[{"id":10239,"lat":39.1954617755,"lng":-84.5426360039,"zoom":10,"place":"HAMILTON, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5559,"title":"California Opposes Slavery on Grounds of Social Idleness","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-05-12","end_date":"1850-09-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By the late 1840s American feelings on slavery smoldered.  According to historian James McPherson, the southern states were pushing for a pro-slavery constitution in California, and western slavery not just as an abstraction, but as a legitimate southern goal.  As the debate raged in congress over the admittance of California as a free or slave state, the Californians in San Francisco had all but settled the issue for themselves. The May 24, 1848 issue of the<em> Californian,</em> a newspaper out of San Francisco, published an article expressing local views on slavery; “Wherever slavery exists it is invariably accompanied with a supineness and stagnation of the vital blood of a nation, consequent upon the prevalence of the short-sighted idea that to work for a living is ungentlemanly.”  The population of California had largely lived under Mexican rule, under which slavery had been outlawed for some time. The previously Mexican population, combined with a lack of major immigration from southern states, yielded a territory in which free labor was the dominate system.  Not only did slavery not develop in California, the working Californians held a resistance to the institution, which considered physical labor the domain of slaves, and not of gentlemen.","The<em> Californian</em> continued to attack the institution of slavery, holding it responsible for a perceived lack of southern motivation: “Take, for example, the state of Georgia, one of the best lumber regions in the United States. Thousands of pine trees are rotting in her forests, while the lumber used in house-building is imported from Maine.” In the author’s view, the unmotivated whites in southern states made up a “class of ‘unproductive consumers,’” that was “fearfully large.”","The labor system in the North was much more akin to the ranch and farm life in southern California and the mines in the northern part of the territory.  This similarity, in contrast to the clash with southern values, helped firmly place California’s ties with the northern states and the free labor system.","Like many free states, California’s resistance to slavery did not stem from a moral stance, as much as from a desire to protect free labor.  According to historian David Lavender the legislators banned slavery as much because they were opposed to the idea of free men working beside blacks as they were against the institution of slavery.  He also reported that several of the state-makers considered barring all blacks from the state, free or slave.","In 1850 congress settled the debate over California through the famed compromise of that year, in which the South was pacified with a new and tougher Fugitive Slave Act, and the reorganization of Utah and New Mexico into territories that could determine whether or not they would allow slavery on their own.  However, California was admitted to the Union as a free state, a state that reflected the opinions of its people, not a State brought into the Union as a simple means of balancing power between two competing factions."],"display_date":"May 12, 1848 - September 20, 1850","search_date":"1849-07-16","locations":[{"id":15203,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5580,"title":"Slave Sarah Frances Shaw Graves Recalls an Unjust Whipping","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-01","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","Sarah Frances Shaw Graves was born a slave in Missouri.

In reality, she believed that the master’s daughter, Puss, kicked the dust onto the bride’s dress. Nevertheless, she endured, “the worst whippin’ I ever got. The worst whippin’ in my whole life an’ I still got the marks on my body.” When they all got home, the master meant to whip her again. Graves remembered, “…I got mad, an’ told him it was a lie, an’ if Puss said I kicked dust on the white folks she was a DAMNED LYIN’ DEVIL.”[sic] He believed her and whipped Puss for lying to him. She commented that she never cursed because she is a good Methodist woman, but she did that day to save herself another whipping.  She talks throughout the interview about her masters whipping her for things she did wrong and things she did not deserve to be whipped for. She even says at one point that her mama’s master, “…whipped his slaves for pastime.”","As described in <em>Roll Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made</em>, slaves were sometimes killed due to excessive whipping. Whipping was a way to break or correct slaves, but abolitionists described this action as inhumane. Slaveholders believed that whippings were better than capital punishment. Their defense was that, “civilized countries like Germany permitted young mine workers-mere boys- to be whipped.” They did not believe that whipping was a crime, and that if it was a crime, it was only minor one.","To find this information about Sarah Frances Shaw Graves and other former slaves, the Works Progress Administration (WPA), conducted interviews with former slaves. The interview was done in person at her home in Skidmore, Missouri. The WPA conducted their series, Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers’ Project.

Jefferson served two terms as President of the United States from 1801-1809. He will always be remembered as the principal author to the Declaration of Independence. On October 26, 1826, at the Columbian College in Washington D.C., Jefferson’s eulogy was delivered by a member of the senior class. John W. James writes, “He whom we mourn, was surpassing great; great in intellect; great in stores of knowledge; great in the highest offices a nation could bestow; great throughout his life.”  Jefferson’s political impact certainly resonated throughout the entire nation. He sparked the greatest expansion westward as he was responsible for the Louisiana Purchase. Jefferson, however, passed away on the day the country celebrated their independence.  James explained, “He whom, on the <em>Fourth of July, </em>no one could forget; who fondly hoped was then uniting in the rejoicings of his country, was indeed but hovering over the earth, ready to take his flight to an eternal rest.”","Jefferson, like many white male citizens, enjoyed the freedoms in the early periods of the nineteenth century. He did not live long enough to see his country torn apart by the issue of slavery. Unfortunately, as author James McPherson explains, “Jefferson’s empire for Liberty had become mostly an empire for slavery. Territorial acquisitions since the Revolution had added slave states of Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, and Texas to the republic.” This became the great contradiction of the United States. A country engrained in democratic principles and equality did not preach and practice those principles. John O’Neal, member of <em>Junebug Productions, </em>examines, “The only social system that is more ubiquitous than racism is that which supports and gives definition to the system of male privilege that has come to be called ‘The Patriarchy.” Jefferson, a slave owner himself, contemplated his positioning on slavery. He opposed slavery yet owned slaves. Intentionally or unintentionally, Jefferson’s westward expansion and disposition towards slavery contributed to the racial atmosphere of the United States.

The idea of the abolition of slavery became the central political issue in the North as well as the South during the 1850s. In 1853, Doctor John H. Van Evrie of New York explained, “Gigantic efforts are now being made to convince the people of the North that the overthrow of the present relations of black and white races in the South, or what is mistakingly called ‘the Abolition of Slavery.” Doctor Van Evrie argued against the benefits of the abolition of slavery for whites, blacks, and the whole of the United States civilization. As he clarified, “To overthrow the present relation of the races is to injure both the white man and the Negro, and to inflict a deadly blow upon the cause of humanity, civilization, and Christianity.” Fortunately, his political opinion was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. However, racism remained rampant in the North and especially in the South. Dr. Van Evrie argued that a philanthropic movement, sparked by the Quakers, led to a gradual emancipation of slaves in the northern states. He concluded that, “Several states were induced to follow the example of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.” Gradual emancipation occurred in New Jersey and New York followed by the rest of the northern states. The movement gained significant strength in the latter part of the decade.","Historian Leon F. Litwack explained that, “Fundamental differences existed between a condition of legal servitude and freedom, municipal, state and federal statutes which relegated northern Negroes to a position of legal inferiority.” Northern freedmen were not held captive by slavery; however, they did experience discrimination and certain prejudices which subjected them to poor socio-economic standing. Litwack detailed in his article that, “Northern Negroes found themselves systematically separated from the white community.” Although Van Evrie’s argument may be immoral, he was right that the abolition of slavery would cause problems for the population as a whole. Integration of blacks into the communities had been a disaster as Litwack points out. Blacks were mistreated greatly and the political debate on the abolition of slavery annihilated the wig party altogether. Dr. Van Evrie would certainly argue that the abolition of slavery caused more harm to the United States than good."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5634,"title":"The Campaign of Louis Kossuth and the Slavery Question","course_id":96,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-10-20","end_date":"1851-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1851, Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth became an international celebrity who found himself trapped in the divisive slavery politics of the United States. He gained notoriety worldwide as a brilliant crusader for the liberty of his country, and upon announcing a tour around the United States to enlist support for his cause, Kossuth was met with the enthusiasm of the American media. The <em>New York Times</em> welcomed him and published his “Address to the People of the United States.” In his address he explained Hungary’s “struggle of independence” as not much different from America’s former struggle. Kossuth flattered Americans, suggesting that American liberty inspired the rest of the world: “May your great example, noble Americans, be to other nations the source of social virtue; your power be the terror of all tyrants- the protector of the distressed; and your free country ever continue to be the asylum for the oppressed of all nations.”"," ","Though Kossuth intended his message to be an invitation to help him, different parts of the nation interpreted it in their own way. Kossuth never mentioned slavery in his address. However, his appreciation of the US as a “free country” and his condemnation of “tyrants” caught the attention of abolitionists who hoped to enlist Kossuth in their cause. Abolitionists felt something of kinship with Kossuth as they viewed the oppression of slaves and Hungarians to be similar causes. Abolitionists urged Kossuth to endorse abolition but felt betrayed when he refused to do so. Knowing that such a declaration would cost him support in the most of the country and hoping to raise funds from rich southerners, Kossuth tried to avoid associating with abolitionists. He appealed to Southerners in supporting states' rights but ultimately was unable to advocate for democracy abroad when many leading Southerners would hardly promote democracy at home. His image as a freedom fighter was too much for conservative southern slaveholders to handle, so they rejected Kossuth’s presence and mission during his tour."," ","After a stay of about a year in the US, Kossuth failed to raise adequate support and funds for his cause. His tour of the US revealed how avoiding slavery politics was impossible during a time when the question of slavery consumed the nation. Though his cause was separate from slavery issues, Americans managed to interpret Kossuth through an American lens. Since his mission did not fit exactly into any side of the slavery debate, Americans felt comfortable ignoring Kossuth and focused on their own issues. The strong divisiveness of slavery politics shaped how Americans confronted foreign policy, and Kossuth’s visit proved the US was not ready to confront issues of freedom internationally when freedom was being contested so heatedly on their own soil."],"display_date":"October 20, 1851","search_date":"1851-10-20","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":1218,"tag":"The New York Times"},{"id":1597,"tag":"Louis Kossuth"}],"course":{"name":"Transatlantic Abolitionism","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":96,"school_id":11}},{"id":5635,"title":"Sojourner Truth: Feminist and Abolitionist Speech","course_id":99,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-05-28","end_date":"1851-05-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sojourner Truth, an emancipated slave, had a vision in 1843 that convinced her that God wanted her to speak the truth about Americans' sins against African Americans as well as women. She presented these two causes as \"inextricably intertwined.\" Sojourner Truth became a public speaker in many events in antislavery and women's rights.","On May 28-29, 1851, Truth gave a particularly compelling speech. She began her speech by saying that she had the same physical capability as men did. She claimed to be just as strong and just as able. This indicates that she considered both sexes to be equal, but that is not all that she was saying. Truth was also speaking of slavery. The reason that she believed she was as physically capable as men was that as a slave, she worked alongside men plowing, reaping, husking, chopping, and mowing.","Continuing in her speech, Truth said that, as for intellect, women have a little pint and men have a quart. Harriet Beecher Stowe also mentions this concept in her book Sojourner Truth, The Libyan Sibyl. She quotes Truth: \"S'pose a man's mind holds a quart, an' a woman's don't hold but a pint; ef her pint is full, it's as good as his quart.\"","Sojourner Truth ended her speech, saying: \"But man is in a tight place, the poor slave is on him, woman is coming on him, and he is surely between a hawk and a buzzard.\" Truth is directly pointing to women and slaves, which, when combined, make up the essence of her ministry. The tone here is very matter-of-fact. There is no question that Truth believed that the eventual success of the feminist and abolitionist movements was inevitable.","Sojourner Truth was born a slave in New York state, but she was freed in 1827 when that state abolished slavery. She was never taught to read, but that did not stop her from travelling to speak to people about God and His hatred of unfair treatment of African Americans and women. \"She had had such a full experience of the wrongs of slavery, that she could not believe they were permitted by God. She was sure he must hate them, and would destroy those who persisted in perpetrating them.\" As for the feminist part of her teachings, she often asked the question: \"Was not Christ born of a woman?\" She answered her own question in this famous speech in Akron, Ohio, saying: \"Through God who created him and woman who bore him. Man, where is your part?\"","Sojourner Truth was a woman ahead of her time, who believed in God and the healing of this nation through the abolitionist and women's rights movements, and she made no apologies for those beliefs.

There are moments throughout the narrative as a whole where feelings of loneliness or helplessness shine through although she never expresses her opinion because it would be uncharacteristic for a slave to do so.","Bethany Veney was one the slaves in Virginia who never had to endure being sold at the market and worry about being separated from her children by distance. Although Bethany was eventually separated from her children, she managed to reunite with them later on in her life when she became free slave.

She did not have to deal with being examined by potential buyers or fear being sold in public. Bethany was sold twice in her life, once after her first master died and the second time she asked to be sold alongside her daughter because she did not like her master, whom she described as harsh and cruel.

To add insult to injury, his father had stolen their master's horses and had them attached to the cart that would carry the family to safety. When the master, Rev. Thompson of Canaan Township, arose the next morning, he would discover both his slaves and horses missing while James Mars and his family were rolling into the neighboring community of Norfolk, in the foothills of the Berkshire mountains in the remote northwest corner of Connecticut. The consequences of this defiant, daring escape would be tense and unsettling for the escapees, as they would be relentlessly hunted by Thompson and his posse. In pursuit of freedom, they were running for their lives.","James Mars's slave narrative is absorbing, and he tells it thoughtfully and with careful consideration of details to place the reader in sufficient context. From what the reader can gather, Mars's master, Rev. Thompson, owned property in Virginia as well, and his wife -- who was from there -- coupled with tensions between the North and the South influenced him to move down to his southern estate. However, when he broke the news of the move to his slaves, Mars's father outright refused to be taken South and plotted a daring escape to save his family from inevitable disaster. Mars bestowed great credit to his father for having had the foresight and courage to attempt such a risky endeavor. As Mars explains in the narrative, \"My father, although a slave without education, was intensely watching the movements of the teacher of the people [Thompson], but kept all that he saw to himself, yet he was steadily planning his escape.\" Removing his family to nearby Norfolk, Mars's father sought shelter from a number of sympathetic white families. They hoped that if they held out long enough in Norfolk, their master would just cut his losses and depart permanently for Virginia; however, Reverend Thompson proved relentless in his determination to recover his slaves, and ultimately he discovered the whereabouts of his slaves and negotiated with them to ensure that he at least recovered the monetary worth of the family's two boys, Mars and his brother. The accord the two sides arrived at saw Mars and his brother being sold to separate masters -- with the slave family, surprisingly, awarded some say in determining who their boys would work for -- while Mars's father, mother, and sister were freed. This order of business settled, cruel Thompson finally departed for Virginia. The whole experience lasted, it can be inferred, a matter of months.","Mars's narrative is an unusual one in the grand collection of slave narratives, not only because of the northern location but also because Mars and his family were allowed such generous space in interacting with their legal owners. Historian Walter Johnson, in his landmark monograph <em>Soul by Soul</em>, explores how, in the slave markets of southern cities such as New Orleans, the commodities being offered -- a.k.a., the slaves themselves -- exercised some agency in the transactions in that they could, through facial expressions or posture or other means of passive communication, influence who purchased them. However, compared to this minimal control in determining their own fates as articulated by Johnson, James Mars and his family were able to obtain substantial leverage in negotiating with their master. For example, the exasperated Reverend Thompson agreed, per his slaves' wishes, to free Mars's parents and sister and relinquished control of the two boys to other slave masters whom Mars's family had had a say in selecting for their sons. And, while Mars was serving as a slave to his designated master, Mr. Munger, he demonstrated surprising boldness in dealing with Munger, repeatedly butting heads with his owner over when and under what conditions he was to be freed. Ultimately, Mars negotiated a satisfactory termination of his own involuntary servitude under Munger and on warm terms with the family to which he served, as he asserted he felt he had become a member of the family and remained in touch with them throughout his adulthood. In stark contrast to Walter Johnson's argument that reveals the meager means of agency that Africans in southern slave markets derived from the daily transactions, Mars and his family, albeit living in the North but nonetheless in a largely inhospitable climate and at an earlier time than the era depicted in Johnson's monograph, were able to exert some significant leverage against their owner and therefore paved the path for future abolitionist endeavors.","Beyond mere agency of the slaves, Mars's narrative indicates also, in agreement with Walter Johnson's definition of the \"chattel principle\" in <em>Soul by Soul</em>, that slave owners had a foremost concern for cash and that that thirst for wealth far outweighed any paternalistic obligations toward their slaves that slaveowners sensed. Mars was especially disturbed, it seems, by how his former master Rev. Thompson, the esteemed and morally impervious pastor of his parish, could not only practice the inhumane institution of slavery but also, in good conscience, be willing to either condemn his slaves to a life of misery on a southern plantation or sell them to another man for hard cash. Mars's depiction of Thompson directly relates to Walter Johnson's explanation of how slave masters, though some purported to have a paternalistic, charitable attitude toward their slaves, were in fact and invariably more concerned with increasing their wealth and would not hesitate in selling loyal slaves and separating families in exchange for cash. The slaves, perceived as chattel property and mere commodity, were expendable, and thus the inhumanity of slavery was only metastasized."," "],"display_date":"1798 - 1815","search_date":"1807-01-01","locations":[{"id":15295,"lat":41.7868855542,"lng":-73.2333892529,"zoom":7,"place":"Litchfield, Connecticut"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5656,"title":"Refuge in Religion: The Story of the Baptist Minister Noah Davis","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Noah Davis sat puzzled, he contemplated his next move. He had already purchased six of his children back from various slave owners, through hard work and many favors gained from people he discovered on his travels. His life defined turmoil. Noah Davis worked against the clock to purchase his seventh and final child, his daughter who was born into bondage. Noah Davis was already well versed in the North, as he had traveled often in search of funds to help pay for the church he planned on starting in Baltimore. He arrived into Boston where he was able to leave with 400 dollars toward his daughter's freedom. On those Boston streets, Davis stood star struck as he noticed his old master. He remembered what his master once said to him, \"I am not afraid of you running away Noah,-- you may go where you please.\" This was the same man, who made Noah's freedom possible, the same man who granted Noah Davis a free pass to the North to collect the money to buy his own freedom.","Noah's fortunes shifted greatly, and he thanked God. He then traveled to Providence, where he had worked hard to collect the money to purchase his daughter's freedom. Noah Davis was invited to preach, and give sermons at local Baptist churches throughout Providence. On his final day, through these church meetings, the most significant moment in Noah Davis' quest for his daughter's freedom occured. While Noah prepared for his trip to New York, a man of great authority approached Noah with a propisition. In front of the entire meeting, the man proclaimed \"Brother Davis, give yourself no more trouble about that daughter,-- You say you have to stop in New York. Let me say say, that when you get home, whatever you lack of the four hundred dollars, write to me, and I will send you a check for the balance.\" Noah proclaimed this as an act of God, and to his relief, promulgated \"I now left Providence, feeling in my heart that the place is rightly called by that name, as far as I am concerned.\"","In truth, Noah Davis was blessed to have the mild-mannered master in Fredericksburg, as he was allowed space to develop as an individual. However, as discussed in Walter Johnson's book <em>Soul by Soul, </em>were the concepts of turning people into commodities and the creation of a law of supply and demand for slaves. The harsh reality is that Noah Davis not only had to buy himself out of freedom, but also his seven children who were born into bondage as well. Through his focus on faith, and the connections he was able to make during his time traveling and in Baltimore, he was able to possess the strength to purchase his family. It is one of the many horrors of the slave market, and slavery in general, this idea that a family can be broken apart, and then sold individually in correlation with a notional concept of a human stock market. Even though Noah Davis freed his children from bondage, this reality is merely a fantasy for the majority of slaves who were taken from their kin and sold in the \"Deep South\".","This quote in Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em> displays the rarity of the circumstances in which had unfolded for Noah Davis, \"... some few others were able to gain their freedom by purchasing themselves.\" Noah Davis lived a life in which he was able to escape the normal.

As a child, he was separated from his family, and was sold and purchased by three different masters. Brown suffered from many acts of cruelty from his masters: he lost partial use of one eye after being kicked in the face repeatedly by an overseer. He was also used in a number of gruesome experiments performed by a doctor who was seeking the cure for sun stroke. After multiple attempts to escape, Brown found himself in a slave pen in New Orleans. After being sold from the pen, Brown finally managed to escape from his owner in Mississippi, and he was able to attach himself to part of the Underground Railroad, making his way North. He eventually managed to gain passage to England, having heard tales of freedom in Britain from slaves in his past.","While Brown attempted to maintain a low profile in the slave pen, he was able to observe some of the subtleties that lay beneath the surface of the slave trade. During his three months at the slave pen, Brown was able to gain insight into the slave trade, noting the subtle differences between potentially cruel owners, compared to those who may have been more forgiving. Walter Johnson, in his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, discusses how slave-traders were regarded with disdain by all, including other slave-holders. In fact, multiple times Johnson quotes Brown's narrative, particularly the chapters in which Brown discsses his time in the slave pen. Traders would constantly force slaves to stand straight, smile, and \"act the part\", in order to manipulate buyers, even when the slaves were at their most vunerable. Brown recalled how \"Even the poor, dear, little children, who are crying and wringing their hands after 'daddy and mammy,' are not allowed to exchange with them a parting caress\"(118). There was heavy emphasis placed on the interaction between potential buyers and slaves, but some slaves, including John Brown, were able to use this to their advantage. Although small, slaves found a source of power within the Slave Market. Some buyers would avoid slaves who stood too tall and answered too quickly, thinking that those slaves might cause trouble. Others would pass over those who showed weakness, either physically or emotionally. Through his observations of these interactions, Brown developed an ability to \"cheat the system\" in a way, acting undesirably towards buyers who he thought would be cruel, while adopting a more favorable view towards potentially more gentle masters.

The funds her church had raised to put her through school had been stolen from her, but her passion had not been taken along with it. Saving up her earnings to pay for her schooling had been difficult, but her dream of one day being able to teach fellow former slaves to read and write so that they could become better Christians helped her bide her time to ensure that day could come."," ","Slavery in the United States could not be boiled down to a universal experience. The varying degrees of cruelty exhibited by owners created a spectrum of suffering on which the lives of slaves fell. Kate Drumgoold had the good fortune of growing up in the years just before the Civil War broke out in the home of an exceptionally caring owner. She was one of thirteen children, but she was frequently separated from her mother and siblings and the family underwent long periods of time without contact. Drumgoold had no choice in being parted from her family during her younger years, but she would not allow this powerlessness to define her life later down the line. Attending church was an integral part of Drumgoold’s relationship with her ‘white mother,’ as she referred to the wife of her owner, and the education she received there endowed her with a sense of personal empowerment. Upon reaching adulthood, though Drumgoold was technically free, she still depended on the employment of the same families who would have owned her just years earlier. Despite this, Drumgoold disregarded official assignments concerning the location of her work, choosing instead to remain loyal to the families she liked better, the women she felt needed her, and ultimately, herself. She asserted power in a situtation where she seemed to have none."," ","It is true that Drumgoold was already a free woman when she shaped her circumstances, but that does not mean her ancestors were unable to create a sense of agency for themselves. Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em> delves into the mindset and behaviors of all parties involved in the New Orleans slave market—traders, owners, and the slaves themselves. Johnson informs the reader of the ability the slaves in pens had to potentially influence their sales through networks of communication, personal observations, and mastering the art of answering questions. The availability of this opportunity varied and some individuals were more adept at taking advantage of it than others, but what is important is that it did in fact exist."," ","Kate Drumgoold lived in Virginia in a domestic setting, not in New Orleans as a field hand, and she was never put up for auction, but she and the individuals discussed by Johnson exhibited similar skills in manipulation for personal benefit. Those who remained enslaved were only able to control their lives so much, but Drumgoold used the freedom afforded her by time to pay it forward, working to put herself through school so that she in turn could educate other former slaves, continuing the tradition of self-improvement against the odds."," "],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":13742,"lat":37.3864763379,"lng":-77.5769179581,"zoom":9,"place":"CHESTERFIELD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5645,"title":"The Power of Family Bonds in a Teenage Slave Girl's Story","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Mattie J. Jackson wrote her story down after she has achieved her freedom in her late teenage years and published the booklet in 1866 in Lawrence, MA in order to raise money for her education. She had a restless childhood with many ups and downs due to constant changes of location with and without her family members. Actually it is more her family’s story, which she tells it in a very personal but not exaggerated emotional tone, which is maybe even more touching.","Her story shows how important and shaping family bonding was for slaves although it was so difficult to maintain it. Even a constantly changing family provided some sort of communal life as Johnson describes it in his book <em>Soul by Soul</em> and therefore a refugee for all the members. Her mother’s first two husbands were able to escape slavery while she always had to stay only helping them to achieve freedom, nevertheless, she was able to go on and adapt to the new situations in order to protect her children.","Mattie profited various times from the spirit and courage of her mother Ellen Turner. Once she was heavily punished for no reason and their owner did not stop to hit the girl. So Ellen interfered and did not leave her daughter although he threatened to punish her as well. The combined strength of the two granted them some agency as “he was aware [her] mother could usually defend herself against one man, and both of [them] would overpower him.” This was not a helpless family that accepted to be harassed by their owners instead they stood together and tried to make the best of their condition namely bonding in resistance.","Although Ellen tried everything to keep her family together, she and her children eventually became victims of the “chattel principle” which implies that “any slave’s identity might be disrupted as easily as a price could be set and a piece of paper passed from one hand to another.”Relentlessly Ellen and her daughters have been sold separately even though she made a contract with her owner that she would not escape if he promised not to sell her children. However, the slaveholder broke his promise simply because it served his interest seeing only his property and commodity in them, which he could trade as it pleased him. So Ellen and her three children became objects in the trader’s yard serving the mercantilist purpose of bringing back money to the pockets of their owner. At least Ellen managed in having been sold together with her little son leaving one bond unbroken.","Apart from each other they eventually achieved their freedom and mother and son were able to find Mattie in Indianapolis. The strength of the ever-constant bond of affection between them is obvious in Mattie’s phrasing of the event: “I was overjoyed with my personal freedom, but the joy at my mother’s escape was greater than anything I had ever known”. Only a short time later Ellen’s second husband and father of Mattie’s half brother was able to contact the family and invited the children to live with him in Lawrence, MA, which again proves the lingering effect of family bonding among slaves even after many years of separation. This action of an unrelated man Mattie used to know in her childhood was a communal act of affection, which gave her the opportunity to receive an education in New England and live the rest of her life in peaceful freedom."],"display_date":"1846 - 1866","search_date":"1856-07-01","locations":[{"id":7916,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5647,"title":"The Power of the Slave Market","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-01","end_date":"1869-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Cyrus Branch's father, Neptune, was used to getting lied to.

Upon his owner's death Neptune found himself in the hands of a new master who approached Neptune with an enticing offer; purchase your own freedom. When he finally accumulated the means to do so, his owner graciously accepted the money, but whether out of cruelty or neglect, he fails to file the important legal paperwork required to make such a purchase legitimate. A despondent Neptune was forced to pay again. These instances in Cyrus Branch's narrative enlighten the reader to slavery as a market in the south that depended on rules and regulations, just as any property, and how Southern whites viewed social hierarchy.","The primary focus of Johnson's Soul by Soul is the reality of slavery being the buying and selling of a \"good\". A commodity essential to the function of the South. Often times, slavery as a market is rarely discussed, and Johnson enlightens the reader on the economic reality of the slave market, specifically in Louisiana. In turn, the narrative of Cyrus Branch (John White) is heavily dependent on the buying and selling of slaves. It is very clear, in both these works, that slavery was a financial staple in the Southern way of life. Soul by Soul is very clear of the importance of record keeping in terms of slavery in that era. Like all property, slave deals were expected to be official in formation and documentation, and it is easy to see how Neptune was so easily cheated. In Cyrus' own life, he was sold four times until he was finally able to escape to the North.

He went to the kitchen, where his mother worked, and asked his mistress of his mother’s whereabouts. She said nothing and ordered him back to work. This frightened Watson. He was scared, lonely, worried and weak without his mother. Soon the trauma brought upon him illness. An illness that he was not expected to recover from.","An old slave woman came to Watson’s aid. She felt sorry for the child and began to take care of him. She treated him like the mother that he lost. During his recovery she told him about the mysterious disappearance of Watson’s mother.

The trader entered the house and attempted to take Watson’s mother away. She resisted to the best of her ability. The trade had to tie her up by her hands and feet and then proceeded to drag her away in the horse and buggy that he arrived in. The mysterious disappearance was no longer mysterious. In fact, it was common for slave families. Watson was no longer scared, or lonely, he was now angry, angry that he lost his mother to the slave trade, angry that his family was broken up. He swore that he would escape when he became of age and search for his mother, but as Watson's days in bondage wore one, his mother became a distant memory.","Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em> talks a lot about slavery in the south from the perspective of the slave trade.

Smith</em> serves as a potent reminder of the horrific conditions endured by slaves during the years leading up to the Civil War. Smith’s particular narrative gains added import because of the detailed manner in which he exhaustively recounts the daily realities of slave life. However, there are exceptional elements to the narrative as well. The fact that he learned to write well enough to publish a narrative indicates that Smith’s experiences were, in a very significant way, extraordinary. Thus, <em>The Autobiography of James L. Smith </em>serves as both a representative and unique picture of life in the antebellum South, and eventually, in the postwar North.","Smith begins his narrative by recounting a childhood accident that left him lame for life. He was then hired out to a succession of masters, performing various jobs and learning skills, serving variously as a cook on a small boat, a cobbler, and a house slave. Eventually, the skills he gained as a cobbler led him to be sold to a shoemaker in Virginia. However, Smith ran away from the South in his twenties, successfully reaching Philadelphia. His story does not end there, nor does his historical import. Smith continues to provide a valuable explanation of what life was like for a former slave, recounting prejudices that he faced in the North while looking for work. He ends his account with a detailed treatment of the role of African Americans in the Civil War, exhorting fellow writers to treat his compatriots’ role with more respect.","Smith gains particular historiographical importance when he is placed in the larger narrative of slavery in the American South. Notably, he offers a compelling counterpoint to the views expressed by Saidiya Hartman in her book, <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>. Though Hartman claims that slaves were dehumanized by their daily interactions, as well as incidents of exceptional violence, Smith is notable because of his extremely evident human characteristics that derive from his life experiences. Smith asserts independent agency in escaping from slavery, and in doing so, offers a stinging rejoinder to the claim that slaves’ identities were entirely created for them by white masters.","Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul </em>explores the slaving industry through the eyes of the New Orleans slave market. Smith never personally experienced the horrors of the market, as a man born into slavery. However, his narrative demonstrates the power of threats to be sold further south. Being sent to a slave market is depicted as the worst possible punishment that a master can inflict upon a slave. Through his depiction of the slave markets as a location of dehumanization and cruelty, Johnson demonstrates exactly why that was.","Smith concludes his personal narrative with accounts of his experiences as a preacher, his marriage, and his eventual move to Norwich, Connecticut. However, he veers from personal narrative to a reflection of the role of African Americans in the Civil War, providing a useful glimpse at early historiography regarding a subject that was, according to Smith, badly neglected in the immediate postwar period. He writes, “it is a fact to be lamented that the historians of our country speak so little about the heroic deeds of the colored troops; in fact, by some no mention is made of them at all” (Smith 113). Smith proceeds to give full voice to the neglected narrative of African-American troops in the Civil War, describing the contributions of troops from a variety of theatres, including the Western frontier. <em>The Autobiography of James L. Smith </em>thus concludes by offering one of the first historical treatments of the heroic efforts put forward by African-Americans in service of their own cause. The narrative therefore should properly take its place as a key document, one that is immensely helpful in advancing our understanding of both slave experiences on the plantation, and African-American experiences in the war effort."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1861 - January 1, 1881","search_date":"1871-01-01","locations":[{"id":13985,"lat":37.6195233772,"lng":-76.3456930418,"zoom":10,"place":"LANCASTER, Virginia"},{"id":11230,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"},{"id":398,"tag":"slavery, runaway"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5649,"title":"\"Whiteness\", Power and Control","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["William Wells Brown was owned by Dr. Young, but was hired out to work for different masters throughout his slavery.

He could not make his escape, being heavily outnumbered and carrying the substantial type, so William fought back. He was able to make his retreat, but the sons of slave-holders took the type. William informed Mr. Lovejoy about the incident, and Lovejoy was able to return with the type. However, he did inform William that Samuel McKinney said he would whip him because he had hurt his son. McKinney was true to his word, finding William on the street and striking him over the head five or six times with a large cane. It took William five weeks to be able to walk again.","In Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em>, it is the idea of “whiteness”, the principle of being a true white Southern male, it was necessary to be able to keep slaves in their place. It was the idea of proving how white someone was by how they treated blacks, by either being a slave-holder, becoming a slave-holder or seeking vengeance on a black, treating them as less than human. That was the kind of act McKinney was displaying. The purpose behind finding William again, with the express intention of hurting him, was because William had attacked his son. That was how McKinney perceived the event.","For McKinney the beating was about protecting his white, slave-holding honor. A slave had stepped out of place by hurting his son. It was not important that his son had started the confrontation; it was about how William defended himself. His actions were about protecting the southern hierarchy, the hierarchy on which everything depends. An idea put forth by Saidiya V. Hartman in <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>, the exercise of power by the slave-holders upon the slaves was as important as having a legal title to the slave property. For all slave-holders, it was essential to keep control over the enslaved population because the entire economy was based on that hold. Slaves provided the labor that kept the plantations in business, negating the cost of labor. The planters were able to then invest the funds saved back into the plantation for more land and more slaves. For Southerners, slaves were important for their economic value, and created a cycle where Southerners felt they could not function without slaves. That cycle needed to be protected with violence as a way to maintain control over the labor force.","In William Wells Brown’s life this was one of the few instances where he was personally subjected to the cruelty of the Southern white male. He was personally targeted with the purpose of causing him lasting, physical pain because of his actions, required actions, against a white slave-holding son. As explained in the context of both Johnson and Hartman, McKinney’s actions were intended to prove his “whiteness” and as a symbol of power and control that all slave-holders have over all slaves. McKinney performed a deplorable act, but an act that was not uncommon in the antebellum South."],"display_date":1849,"search_date":"1849-07-02","locations":[{"id":7916,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5652,"title":"Push Enough to Run","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Men and women who owned slaves had to constantly emphasize their position of authority and dominance over the people they owned. Some did so through beatings, starvation, and atrocious treatment. Others did through simple words, such as order a slave to perform a task that the owner knew the slave particularly despised. Regardless of how, each slave's day was full of a constant reminder that they were nothing more than owned manual labor; without an immense stroke of luck, that was all they would ever be.","In Charleston, South Carolina, William Green was reminded of this fact every single day. From the earliest point of his life he was robbed of the good luck that would've made him a free man. He missed being freed by the will of his old mistress because he was born three months before she died; he was no longer to be freed when he was twenty-five because his new master traded him without mentioning that fact to his new owner, and so he became a slave for life.","Eventually, the humiliation and degredation became too much for him to take. Green was acutely aware that the only fact that he was not beaten by his new master was because he was the favorite slave of his master's wife. So instead of being whipped and degraded directly by his master, Green was sent to fetch a box from the jail. Now for Green, that was the last thing he could take. His master had ordered him to go fetch a package from the jail, which on the surface seems mundane. In actuality, as Green very well knew, his master was sending him to the jail to be whipped by the man who ran the jailhouse. So instead of willingly walk to his own beating and potential death, Green decided to flee to Massachusetts. After many months of struggling, he arrive in Springfield, where he lived the rest of his life as a free man.","As Hartman discusses in Scenes of Subjugation, \"a slave must be subject to the master's will in all things,\" and Green wasn't. Whether it was because of the protection from his master's wife, or his acute sense of the injustice he was forced to be subjected to, Green was not an obedient slave. And because of that, his master saw himself as forced to send Green to be whipped at the jail, in an attempt to teach him respect and discipline. And while the master himself couldn't subjugate Green, because Green was still a piece of property, he could still order Green to go somewhere where he could be subjugated. Unfortunately for Green's owner, that line of thinking ended up backfiring.","Becuase of his early life and being robbed of his freedom by being traded, William Green was constantly painfully aware that his life and liberty had been injustly taken from him. This was a constant theme throughout his narrative, and the passion with which he writes about his early years in Charleston clearly show how much hatred he had trapped inside of him during that time.

Helpless and completely immobilized, Charles experienced the incredulous cruelty and suffering of the slavery system.  His natural impulse to feed himself and his fellow slaves were punished in the most humanly disgraceful way.","With all the horror and terror that slaves experienced during this shameful period in our history, one wonders if slave owners ever felt pity for slaves or realized that they were of human flesh and not mindless beasts of burden.  Johnson writes in his book, <em>Soul by Soul,</em> “It was often the case that benevolent correctives and declarations of slave humanity intensified brutal exercise of power upon the captive body rather than ameliorating the chattel condition\" (5). This statement suggests that slaveholders abused their power by destroying the humanity of these poor human beings through torturous acts. Instead of improving their slaves’ already tenuous situation by treating them decently, owners exercised brutal power and used this power to excess. It defined them as an ignorant and hateful group of people."],"display_date":"1830 - 1850","search_date":"1840-07-01","locations":[{"id":6088,"lat":38.0258033782,"lng":-75.2629443285,"zoom":9,"place":"WORCESTER, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":381,"tag":"Antebellum America"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5659,"title":"Community: The Saving Grace of Slavery","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Huddled beneath a large, decrepit tree in the woods, Isaac Mason was closer to freedom than ever before.  He had escaped his master, which seemingly should have been the hardest part of his journey.  However, Mason found himself desperately trying to convince his fellow fugitives that freedom was worth it—worth the wait and worth the nerves.  Mason’s whole future, and his freedom, was on the line as he tried to persuade the two slaves that had escaped with him to stick to the objective.  Looking up at the North Star, the star placed there by the Lord “to lead people out of slavery,” Mason took things into his own hands.  With hope in his heart, Mason found John Brown, the guide they had been waiting for, a few miles away from their hideout.  While Mason undoubtedly had to be passionate on his quest for freedom, he also had to be willing to trust others.  As the three runaway slaves were transferred from Brown to the hands of another man, Mason convinced himself to simply transfer his confidence in Brown to the stranger.  Mason justified this saying Brown’s “deep interestedness in rescuing his race from the cruel chains of slavery, had established the faith that he would not permit us to be betrayed into the hands of a friend or advocate of the cruel institution.”","It was not as hard as one might have thought for Mason to put his trust in complete strangers.  For in a way, the blacks of the southern states had already experienced so much together, and were far from strangers. There was a community built upon the shared experience of slavery.  The bonds formed by those enslaved persons were stronger than the institution of slavery itself.  Mason was lucky enough to escape the slave pens Walter Johnson described in his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, but the communal aspect of slave life was not something one could pass on.  As Johnson points out, there was “a trace of a dense communal life made up of shared time, common meals, and intimate proximity.”  He goes on to state, “slaves were not alone in the trade,” (71). On a broader note, no slave was ever alone in their struggle.   Mason wouldn’t have escaped slavery if it were not for the community formed by the slaves.  And countless other journeys to freedom would have unremarkable endings were it not for the community effort of the blacks.  Slavery was a cruel institution, but it gave birth to an unparalleled communal force."],"display_date":1822,"search_date":"1822-07-02","locations":[{"id":6012,"lat":39.3581940306,"lng":-75.9236060696,"zoom":9,"place":"KENT, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":126,"tag":"fugitive slave"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5663,"title":"The Religion of Slavery: Uncovering community supplanted by religion in ‘The Narrative of William W.

He was unfortunate enough to be subjected to the harsh realities of chattel slavery through years of being rented out to various owners stretching from Missouri to Mississippi. A great deal of his time was spent aboard steamships, as a hand to take care of slaves or to wait on passengers. Wells recounts that after one particular summer aboard a steamship, he returned to the farm to find that his master had “got religion.” William had just left the employment of Captain Reynolds aboard the steamship Enterprize. What may have seemed like a ‘dream’ employment to slaves used to harsh labor conditions turned into a constant reminder for Brown that he was not free, as he was forced to watch white passengers pass from place to place as they pleased, while his brothers and sisters were chained below on their passage to the desolate slave pens of New Orleans.","William Wells Brown was somewhat relieved when he was able to return to life on the farm, despite the work in the “burning sun.” However, he was soon to be placed into the farmhouse as a waiter, where he found a that his master had become a man of devout worship. Brown made an important distinction when he talked of life before religion, and after. William wrote, “Formerly, we had the privilege of hunting, fishing, making splint brooms, baskets, &c.  on Sunday; but this was all stopped. Every Sunday, we were all compelled to attend meeting.... At night, the slaves were called in to attend [prayer]; but in the mornings, they had to be at their work...”","Bruce Levine, in his book “Half Slave and Half Free,” asserts that the distinctive labor systems of the North and the South, and particularly the reliance on slavery in the antebellum south, permeated into all aspects of regional life, including religion. Building from this assumption, the abrupt replacement of activities with religion points to the strength of the slave community, and the urgency of slave holders who were dependent on slave labor to undermine it.","William Wells Brown, when later speaking of his observations of a slave auction in St. Louis, recounted the pitch of an auctioneer to potential slave buyers. He writes, “Why should this man tell the purchasers that she has religion? I answer, because in Missouri, and as far as I have any knowledge of slavery in the other States, the religious teaching consists in teaching the slave that he must never strike a white man; that God made him for a slave; and that, when whipped, he must not find fault,--for the Bible says, \"He that knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes!\" And slaveholders find such religion very profitable to them.” Both the twisting of religious verse to justify the beatings of slave and the act of the beatings themselves both served and equal purpose: to keep the slave population in a place of servitude and to degrade any sense of autonomy the slaves might have had.

This gift was ment to make peace. At seven years old Clarke became her property. Banton chose Clarke since he was the son of her father, in choosing him she could split a family up and provide a deeper form of torture. Clarke quoted on what he heard from Mrs. Banton “she would fix me so nobody should ever think I was white” (Clarke 21). Despite having a deeper motivation to beat Clarke, she was abusive to all of her slaves.","Clarke said that there were not many days where Banton didn’t abuse one of her slaves. It was entertainment for Banton, who drank often. She brought up her children to take the same brutal approach to slave holding. One of Lewis’s jobs was to stay up at night to rock the crib of one of the children, if he stopped they would scream for their parents. Taking a break from rocking the crib could warrant a whipping. Two of Banton’s children did not agree with her treatment of the slaves, by doing this they did not endear themselves to their mother.","Abuse was a specialty of Mrs. Banton and she had particular instruments of abuse. Tools such as a shovel and shears were used, materials like rawhide and hickory spurs. Nothing matched her favorite oak club. Clarke said later “Infinitely more bitter than death, were the cruelties I experienced”(Clarke 14) when referencing the beatings he received from Mrs. Banton. In some situations Banton would have Clarke ask for whippings from her drunken husband. Bad enough he was being whipped, worse he had to ask for it.","Saidiya Hartman mentions in her book <em>Scenes of Subjection </em>that a slave owners display of power and dominence was just as important as the actual title to a slave. In other words if you were going to have a slave you needed to prove you could dominate them. In the case of Clarke and Banton, Banton not only needed to own Clarke, but she needed to show him that even though they had the same father, he was her property and was not human enough to be related. Also Banton showed the most dominance by making Clarke ask for a whipping. By doing that she showed that she had so much power over him that he would ask to go through a brutally painful experience.","After working for Mrs. Banton for ten years Clarke was transferred to another plantation. He said that no beating from Mrs. Banton was worse then the pain he felt from being separated from his family. He would only see his family three times in the ten years he worked for Banton.

The name of the slave was Henry Watson. Henry was born into slavery by his late mother, Letty. Like most slaves he had no recollection of his age, he had heard that the age of a slave is kept by the different seasons of the year. If a child were to ask of their age, the answer would be similar to this quote “this planting corn time, you are six, eight or ten”.","Henry awoke one morning in an utter confusion. He asked for his mother but no one spoke his mother was gone. The separation from his mother took a toll on Henry’s emption and body. No one expected the poor young boy to recover until old slave-women began to take care of him. The only way she could comfort young Henry was to give him the most information she could about the untimely disappearance of his loving mother. The story she told was cruel but common in the slave trade era. One day a slave-trader had pulled his buggy up to the front door of the house and his mother was sent forth. As she approached the buggy, she was knocked down, tied and thrown into the buggy. She was never to be seen again. This traumatic event made Henry strong and angry.","Henry learned that the principal business of slave masters was to raise slaves to be sold on the market. Unfortunately, Henry had learned the hard way about the trading process. One day, Henry’s life was turned upside down unexpectedly. Henry saw a man approaching his master’s house so he ran with the rest of children to hide. He got wind that his master was looking for him and ordered him into the house. The man inspected Henry and was satisfied. During the slave trade era, the body of a slave was inspected to for whipping scars or any other discretion on the body. Walter Johnson of <em>Soul by Soul</em> stated that Slave Traders “had to consider the slaves’ perspective to make sure they would have a body to go with the bill of the sale”. Slaves entered the trade alone and anonymous making Henry alone as ever.","In Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul </em>he speaks mainly of the slave trade and the surrounding market.

His proposal had a long and controversial life. During an attempt to pass the bill in 1848, Senator Thomas Corwin, a Whig from Ohio, stood up before the Senate and gave his arguments against the piece of legislation. Senator Corwin opposed slavery. At one point, he stated that if there were a country so hot “the white man is supposed not to be able to work, I would not allow you to take slaves there.” Yet he still strongly opposed the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the amendment was unnecessary, because slavery already existed in some form in the new territories. The senator referred to land expansions in his argument, saying, “if at any time…you have acquired territory where Slavery existed in such form and consistency…it has been permitted to remain where by law it did exist.” Despite being staunchly antislavery, he paradoxically fought against this bill. Senator Corwin had another motive behind his protest of the bill. He saw that the Proviso was just causing another Sectional Crisis and dividing Congress. Corwin opposed it because he, like many at the time, feared that it would lead to southern secession. His speech was an attempt to prevent this eventuality from happening.","The Wilmot Proviso quickly became controversial in Congress, and in some cases, it was for reasons other than slavery. Historian James McPherson writes that there were some southerners who opposed it because they saw “the northern effort to exclude it [slavery] as an insult to southern honor.” The Wilmot Proviso, as this amendment came to be called, passed in the House on two separate occasions, and both times the Senate voted it down. The country was already divided by a series of Sectional Crises, and the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso only exacerbated the problem. Historian Eric Foner called it “the beginning of a path which led almost inevitably to sectional controversy and civil war.” Corwin claimed that there was no way the proviso could possibly lead to that eventuality, but his actions say otherwise. In March of 1861, he proposed an amendment known as the “Corwin Amendment” that would have made it illegal for Congress to amend the Constitution to restrict slavery. The Corwin Amendment was the senator’s attempt to placate the South and prevent them from seceding. He saw how polarizing the Wilmot Proviso was. Corwin opposed it not because he supported slavery, but because he wanted to keep the United States a whole nation. He debated in vain, and the Proviso continued to divide the North and the South."],"display_date":"August 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-08-25","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1801,"tag":"Wilmot Proviso"},{"id":1802,"tag":"Mexican War"},{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5782,"title":"A Pittsburgh Journalist Predicts the Annexation of Cuba, Alaska, and Hawaii","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-08-03","end_date":"1854-08-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the years leading up to the Civil War, the North and South both used the annexation of territories as a strategic device to gain political power. In 1854, with both sides looking to add land, one journalist predicted that the Russian territories in North America, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands), and Cuba would all be U.S. territory within one year. The anonymous author of the article in the <em>Daily Morning Post</em> also hinted that the territories would all then become states. He reasoned that the Whig Party would respond to the purchase of Cuba by the Democrats by purchasing Russian territories and the Sandwich Islands. Sympathizing with the North, the Pittsburgh-based author wrote \"if Cuba comes in as a slave state, the Sandwich Islands and Russian America will enter as free state and over-balance it.\" Although cast into the context of free soil and slave state balance, the annexation of these territories was not only about that battle. The author also recognized the importance of commerce and Manifest Destiny in the annexation, realizing that the Sandwich Islands could serve as a perfect halfway point for ships travelling from the West Coast to China, Japan, and the Indies. He added that \"adventurous Yankees\" could control the natives and turn the islands into a thriving community.","The South had its eye on the annexation of Cuba as early as 1848, when President James Polk unsuccessfully offered Spain $100 million for the island. If Spain had accepted this deal, historian James McPherson believes it was still unlikely to happen because the North's Whig Party had control of the House and would not have appropriated the funds. Knowing it would come in as a slave state, the Whigs would have opposed this move. In 1854, the Democratic Party again tried to purchase Cuba in a proposal known as the Ostend Manifesto. The journalist referred to this proposal in the article when he said \"events now occurring in Spain give promise of such a result (acquisition of Spain).\" This proposal turned out to be unsuccessful because, according to historian High Thomas, anti-slavery newspapers condemned the proposals once it became public knowledge.","Today, it seems that the journalist may have been wishfully thinking when he predicted the country would be able to purchase the Russian territory and the Sandwich Islands. He thought Russia would be eager to sell the land instead of having it taken by Great Britain, because that were combating one another in the Crimean War at the time. His prediction did come to fruition five years after he penned the article when Russia offered the land to the United States. He was only wrong about the time table. There is also little evidence that reveals the U.S. made an effort to acquire the Sandwich Islands in the 1850s.","Despite the inaccuracy of the writers' time table, his predictions demonstrate the desire for more land beyond the continent.

Marion Sims started his day with his routine house-to-house calls in Montgomery, Alabama. Dr. Sims was a well-established and distinguished practitioner of medicine who came to Alabama from South Carolina to establish his own medical practice; he was also best known for his accomplishments in Women’s health and for the establishment of the first Women’s Hospital in the state of Alabama. While on his routine house call, he was notified by a friend that Mrs. Merrill, who was the wife of a prominent farmer, was terribly ill. Upon his arrival, Dr. J. Marion Sims described the situation at hand. ““She was in bed, complaining of great pain in her back, and a sense of tenesmus in both the bladder and rectum, the bearing down making her condition miserable”. Dr. Sims had to act fast on the female patient. Dr. Sims remembered two things while this emergency took place. First he remembered how much he “hated investigating the organs of the female pelvis”, and he also remembered his professor Dr. Prioleau of the Charleston Medical College, who said, “Gentlemen, if any of you are ever called to a case of sudden version of the uterus backward, you must place the patient on the knees and elbows-in a genu-pectoral position- and then introduce one finger into the rectum and another into the vagina, and push up, and pull down”. After executing protocol, Dr. Sims knew ultimately he had to get the uterus in position by using this method prescribed above. Mrs. Merrill was screaming from the top of her lungs as Dr. Sims still hand deep in her vagina pushed his hand toward the lady’s uterus wall and turned his hand upward and downward pushing with all his might until he could no longer feel her uterus or her womb. Mrs. Merrill enduring all of this pain suddenly said “Why, doctor, I am relived.” Just then as Mrs. Merrill was about to lie down on her back, she let out an explosion. Mrs. Merrill was speechless and bashful, but Dr. Sims knew this escape of gas was not from the bowel, but from the vagina. Dr. Sims had a revelation. He thought if the pressure in the vagina could be released in a certain way by the positioning of the body and other methods, he may have an explanation for a possible cure for vesico-vaginal fistula.","Vesico-vaginal fistula is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the bladder and the vagina that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of urine into the vaginal vault. This abnormality is caused by complications in child births or other extreme causes. This female abnormality was very common and Dr. Sims was the leading doctor who experimented, tested, and always tried to seek a solution for this occurrence. His main subjects or guinea pigs were often on African American women. His leading test subject was a slave by the name of Betsy who suffered from this complication. Once the complication was solved for the first time on Mrs. Merrill, Dr. Sims immediately went to his test subject Betsy and performed an operation to heal her infirmities. Throughout the years Dr. J. Marion Sims overcame many medical feats and saved a countless number of women through his expertise, but he is sometimes viewed as a bad guy. According to Dr. L. L. Wall who wrote in The Journal of Medical Ethics, we see that there are some who defend his surgical practice. “Modern critics have discounted the enormous suffering experienced by fistula victims, have ignored the controversies that surrounded the introduction of anesthesia into surgical practice in the middle of the 19th century, and have consistently misrepresented the historical record in their attacks on Sims.” Dr. Wall acknowledges that Dr. Sims used enslaved African Americans as his guinea pigs, but it was not because they were vulnerable, it was due to the incredible suffering they endured on a constant basis.

His narrative starts with telling the reader about his early childhood life and the hardships of staying a family. He stresses to the reader that though many claimed the evils of slavery were getting easier during the times when laws protecting slaves started to come about, but it was in fact the other way around. The masters of the slaves came down harder and the separation from one’s family was more common. He tells the story of how he was taken from his mother and the whipping that she received just for holding him one last time. Ball also speaks to how his father was changed by his enslavement and how his father’s temperament became moodier the older he got. The next section of the narrative tells of his time in the navy yard as a hired out slave and how he met his first wife during that time. Ball shows the hardships that come from being married as slaves because of the fact one changed masters so frequently that staying together becomes impossible. Ball goes on to describe his time when he was sold to a slave trader from Georgia and having to walk all the way to his new plantation in South Carolina cuffed to 51 other slaves. Then, when he arrived he was sold to a cotton plantation where he describes the unfair treatment the slaves received. He compares his experiences from Maryland to that of Georgia and finds Georgia lacking. Ball found Georgia to treat their slaves as not even human beings where Maryland treated their slaves with a sense of pride. It was because of the cruelty that he discovered in Georgia that he decided to escape from slavery and walked back to Maryland to return to his wife and children there. Once there he hired himself out for wages and managed to escape the notice of the government for a long enough time to buy a farm. However, his wife died in 1816 and he remarried two years later. His new life was a very dangerous one and it was not long that he was once again recaptured and returned to slavery. While he was enslaved once again, his family was captured and sold into slavery also. He ends with his escape from slavery once again and his fleeing to Pennsylvania to avoid capture again and with the hopelessness of never seeing his family and children again (Ball).","            This narrative gave credence to two other authors who wrote about slavery by using many different examples of slaves, slave holders, and slave traders. One of those authors was Walter Johnson who wrote the novel Soul by Soul and in it he describes the issue of paternalism. Johnson states that “paternalism, then, was something slaveholders could buy in the slave market” (Johnson 111). For instance, when a slave was traded from master to master he or she would beg his or her old master to allow him or her to stay. It was this begging and this need to be with their old masters that gave way to the feelings of paternalism. Paternalism was a dangerous road for the slave trade to travel on because it enabled the trade to stay alive that much longer. It was this excuse of having feelings of paternalism that helped the slaveholders and the slave traders get the overall public to see the worth that slavery has, by degrading those that were enslaved they enabled the country to try and rationalize something that was irrational. Further, the narrative also shows how the slaveholders effected the process. Ball’s description of some of his holders and some of his tasks he did for these holders revealed how the relationship that the holder had with his slaves truly was an intricate one. For the slaveholders controlling these slaves and having these slaves was a point of pride. Ball describes instances where he said the slaves had to look good because it would have been seen as a very bad thing for the master to mistreat his slaves. "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-01","locations":[{"id":52795,"lat":32.1656221,"lng":-82.9000751,"zoom":8,"place":"Georgia"},{"id":52796,"lat":33.836081,"lng":-81.1637245,"zoom":8,"place":"South Carolina"},{"id":52797,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C"},{"id":52798,"lat":38.4949503,"lng":-76.5025742,"zoom":8,"place":"Calvert County, MD"},{"id":52799,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia P.A"}],"tags":[{"id":386,"tag":"Paternalism"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":2736,"tag":"Separation"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6373,"title":"Escaped Slaves and Lost Profit: John Joseph's escape","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-01-01","end_date":"1843-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The shadows of the trees over-casted the lone road, a single man on horseback patrolling down. He was finishing his late night rounds for the evening, anxious to get home to his family. He was heading down a road to look for any suspicious activity when there was a ruslting in the bushes along the side of the road. He froze and looked over, and saw someone dart out into the road. It was a teenager, around eleven years old. He looked around skittishly, before running to the cop. It took the cop one look to see the black skin of the boy. He grabbed his hand roughly. “What certificate do you have?” the cop shouted, brandishing a pistol. The slave boy, John Joseph, was lead back to his master. ","The story of a slave who was taking back after attempting to escape is all too common in the south. Since the start of the trade, slaves have always looked for escape. Most that did manage to get away found their ways to the Mississippi River. The river, with the steam boats that moved up and down with traded goods, were often open to the idea of hiring on dark skins for the helpful work around the boat, such as deckhands, riggers, table setters, and most commonly, in the furnace rooms for the large steam engines. 'The thousands of blacks who arrived in New Orleans...thus a crucial nexus of the Atlantic world' (16, <em>Black Life on the Mississippi</em>). John had not reached freedom, despite his murmerous sells till he was discovered by a british team on a boat in the Mississippi. They heard his woes, and carried him out to London. ","Slaves that didn't get to a safety port were often dragged back to their old owners and lashed. The lashing left tell tale scars along their backs, which could impact the resale value. Slavers who were in the market for another batch would inspect each slave carefully for any obvious signs of disease, illness, weakness, or scars. Diseased slaves were good as dead, and a weak armed slave could do little for the tasks in the fields of cotton. Scars along the back are similar, to the slavers, as scratches along a car. It shows that either the previous owner was a poor one, or that the slave was disobedient and didn't work or tried to escape. John Joseph had scars, and this would have decreased his value in the markets. John was whipped numerous times under his first owner's thumb. The standard practice at that farm was to whip the slaves, and then see how much they could bring of the harvest. This amount would then be their expected harvest. John attempted escape, as depicted in the story, and when he was brought back, he recieved thirty lashes and was doused in salt water. The scars detailed an escape event, a stiuation where he tried to flee, and it impacted his pay. "],"display_date":"January 1, 1820 - August 8, 1843","search_date":"1831-10-20","locations":[{"id":52763,"lat":29.9510658,"lng":-90.0715323,"zoom":8,"place":"New Orleans, Louisina"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":500,"tag":"trade"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6375,"title":"This Side Up, With Care: The Narrative of Henry Box Brown","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-03-23","end_date":"1849-03-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Henry Box Brown is notorious for escaping from slavery in the southern United States by shipping himself to freedom in the North in a wooden box. In <em>Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown</em>,<em> Written By Himself</em>, Brown described his experiences as a slave, and the events that triggered his bold plan to free himself. Brown was born into slavery in Virginia in 1815, and he described his life as not as physically brutal as that of other slaves. Regardless, Brown argued that slavery was cruel and damaging, particularly in consideration to how it separated him from his family. Brown and his wife were promised by their respective slaveholders that neither of them would be sold, so that they could remain together. Unfortunately, Brown’s wife and children were eventually sold to a slaveholder in North Carolina, and as a result Brown decided that he needed to escape slavery as the helplessness wrought by being enslaved became unbearable. ","Brown had the idea to ship himself in a wooden crate disguised as dry goods to territory in the North where slavery had been abolished. With the help of white abolitionist friends, Brown was successfully shipped from Virginia to Pennsylvania in a box that was three feet one inch long, two feet six inches wide, and two feet deep. Brown travelled in the box a distance of 350 miles in a period of 27 hours. He carried with him only a small portion of water stored in a bladder, for the purpose of hydration and wetting his face so that he would not faint. During the journey, the box was often thrown, tipped, and turned upside down, causing Brown pain and injury. The box was labelled “this side up with care,” but on a few occasions the box was tipped upside down, and Brown had to carefully balance himself so that he would not snap his neck. He risked being found and brought back into slavery or being physically hurt during his treacherous escape, but he successfully completed the trip without harm. When the box arrived in Philadelphia, Brown was greeted by several abolitionists, who celebrated his safe and successful journey. Brown’s testimony of his desperation to escape shows how even in the absence of physical brutality, slavery was a cruel, dehumanizing institution because of the mental and emotional impact it had on enslaved people.","The slave trade separated people from their loved ones and destroyed lives without any remorse, and as a result slaves like Brown reacted dramatically. In <em>Soul By Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market</em>, historian Walter Johnson introduces the chattel principle, a concept which states that “any slave’s identity might by disrupted as easily as a price could be set and a piece of paper passed from one hand to another” (19). This principle essentially describes how the life of a slave was never stable because the threat of sale always loomed over their heads. Johnson further describes how disruptive slavery was to the bonds that enslaved persons forged between each other, stating that most intelligent, self-aware slaves knew that every social relation, whether by blood, love, or friendship, was in no way secure because its dissolution by the slave trade was always imminent. In Brown’s narrative, he criticized this disruptive nature of the slave trade, stating that “the tyrant slaveholder regards not the social, or domestic feelings of the slaves… without giving the slightest consideration to the domestic or social ties by which the individuals are bound to each other,” because the slaveholders felt that the slaves’ feelings did not matter (17). Being separated from his family greatly pained Brown and caused him to grow weary of his bondage, which triggered his determination to escape from slavery hidden in a wooden shipping crate."," "],"display_date":"March 23, 1849","search_date":"1849-03-23","locations":[{"id":11224,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"},{"id":52765,"lat":37.9925909,"lng":-77.973865,"zoom":8,"place":"Louisa County, Virgina"}],"tags":[{"id":2729,"tag":"Runaway Slave"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6376,"title":"Thomas Anderson and His Faith in God","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Thomas Anderson, known as Uncle Tom where he resided in Hanover, Virginia, grew up with no one to care for his welfare causing him to become very cold and wicked. This outlook and attitude continued until he was nineteen, when he was led to a religious meeting held by Baptists. There he learned that the wicked had no hope beyond the grave, scaring him into searching for a friend, which he found in God. His newfound faith instilled a positive outlook within him that God would always be there to help him. His master at the time did not understand religion, claiming he could whip the fancy of religion out of him; so he tried, but upon failing to break Tom’s spirits, he was defeated, and Tom was no longer whipped after that day. Although beaten and bloodied, Thomas felt strong and whole because of the Spirit that warmed his heart, the love of God defeating the physical brutality of his slave master. With his master’s permission, Tom joined the church; his master himself thought if there was a Christian in the world, it was Tom. Throughout his life, Thomas Anderson’s faith in God was unshaken.","It is commonly known that to be enslaved is to endure a life of brutality at the discretion of one’s slave owner; the case of Thomas Anderson was no different. In order to combat the ideal of such cruel treatment, slave owners would allow their slaves some sort of reward, benefit, or “freedom,” as Saidiya Hartman discussed in her book, <em>Scenes of Subjection, </em>about masters who allowed for festivities such as a Christmas party. Thomas’s slave master allowed for his participation in the church, which thus can be perceived as one of the “freedoms” a slaveholder may have provided. This “freedom” is simply a tool utilized by slave owners to justify to themselves that their ruling and power over their slaves is not as harsh as it seems, when indeed it is. By offering such privileges, the slaveholder hopes to pacify his slaves, while also expecting hard work in return; this is exactly what these privileges resulted in, but more so out of fear that if these offerings were not respected, the master’s brutality would intensify. These “freedoms” created fear among slaves, just as a beating would do, being used as a scare tactic to achieve the master’s personal demands. This was a system that instilled fear in slaves, who would succumb to the brutal world they lived in.","Yet another brutal aspect of the life of the enslaved was the inhumanity among the slave trade. Individuals involved in the slave trade were young and single, as this allowed the individual to be as detached from any sense of family bonds and dynamics, therefore being able to separate families without being troubled by conscience. Despite the hardship associated with ones family being separated, Uncle Tom spoke of such matters in a positive light, bringing attention to his hope for a reunion. He did discuss the hardship involved in seeing his children dying, being sold, or being traded and taken away from the family, but he looked to his religious foundations to free him of negative thoughts and a poisonous mentality. His faith in God gave him hope that he and his children would one day be reunited, if not on earth, in the life that followed. Luckily, the “freedom” Thomas was allowed taught him to approach life with his head unbowed. God instilled within him a positive outlook on life that allowed him to carry himself through the hardship, trusting that his faith in the Lord would serve him what he deserved for enduring the life he did."," "],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":52766,"lat":37.4315734,"lng":-78.6568942,"zoom":4,"place":"Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2730,"tag":"Slavery and Religion"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6385,"title":"The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery in America to Freedom in England","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-12-01","end_date":"1852-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William and Ellen Craft were both born in 1820s Georgia to, by the standards of that time, fairly sensitive masters. Neither was ever beaten by their masters, yet they still could feel the shackles of slavery. They met each other in 1846 by coincidence, and by 1848 were married. Their decision to escape slavery was heavily influenced by, besides their desire for and right to freedom, their desire to raise children out of the confines of slavery. Their escape was quick—eight days from their initial idea—however it was not easy and they ran into many obstacles along the way.","Their idea was based on the fact that Ellen’s quadroon skin made her passably white. So, they decided she was going to dress up as William's male master and chaperone him to Philadelphia, a free state. With nerves rumbling, they gathered costumes and props--Ellen decided to wear glasses and poultices around both her mouth and her arm so that she would neither be recognizable nor be asked to speak or write. Their masters issued them “holiday” papers for a short Christmas vacation. Along their journey, they encountered Ellen's family's friend and William's employer, but luckily were not caught. Many pro-slavery Southern Whites they met warned Ellen, code-named \"William Johnson,\" that her “slave” may escape when they get to the North. Blacks free and enslaved urged William to seek freedom when he got to Philadelphia.","If William and Ellen had good masters, why, then, did they want so badly to be free? Did they not have food, a job, a bed? This sentiment is what Saidiya Hartman says is the worst part of this institution. \"If the excess of enjoyment imputed to the enslaved displaced what we would think of as disturbing circumstances, it did so only by obscuring violence and comflating it with pleasure\" (Hartman 25). The institution's ideologies as a whole seeped within the community in the form of subconscious racial discrimination and subordination, allowing whites to alleviate their guilt in an instance where a slave seems to be treated more humane than usual. This natural inclination towards racism under the lens of paternalistic, goodly masters is seen throughout the Craft's interactions with the upper-middle to upper class white persons on the trains and steamers. When they were on a train in Richmond, an elite woman mistook William for her escaped \"Ned\" because she “never in my life saw two black pigs more alike” (Tweedie 62).  This incidence truly emphasizes the social atmosphere of the era. A majority of whites held skewed views of blacks and a lot of people were very proud and open about it. This woman was of a paternalistic view of blacks, that they were less intelligent and she knew what was best for them. This idea led her to change the will of her late husband, which had called for the emancipation of his slaves. She sold them because she thought it was “such a cruel thing to turn n****rs loose to shift for themselves, when there are so many good masters to take care of them” (Tweedie 64). A discussion, thus, took place amongst her, Ellen, and gentleman who was sitting by them, though it brought no change of mind to the woman. She reserved her paternalistic view of her slaveholding status."," Mysteriously, the couple came across much luck in their travel. At the port in Baltimore en route to free land in Philadelphia, a \"Yankee of the low order\" (Tweedie 68) claimed he could not let men with slaves pass without his approval, to prevent the emancipation of the slaves. With sheer luck, the conductor of the train recognized the couple and convinced the Yankee to let them board. While in Philadelphia, they met a man who was a member of the Society of Friends and who graciously hosted them for three weeks. During those three weeks, the freed William and Ellen learned the alphabet and how to spell and write their names.","It came to be, however, that they were not safe in the supposedly free land of the North for, in 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was enacted and their masters sent out warrants for their re-enslavement. As quickly as they arrived in the North, they fled for Canada and then England. William remarks at the end of his narrative about how unfortunate it is that, in order to be free, he and Ellen had to flee a land that prides itself in freedom and equality for the land which that country fled from just a few centuries prior.","                                    \"In short, it is well known in England, if not all over the world,                                                                                        that the Americans, as a people, are notoriously mean and cruel                                                                                    towards all coloured persons, whether they are bond or free\" (Tweedie 111). "],"display_date":"December 1, 1848 - January 31, 1852","search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":52774,"lat":32.8406946,"lng":-83.6324022,"zoom":8,"place":"Maçon, GA"},{"id":52775,"lat":32.0835407,"lng":-81.0998342,"zoom":8,"place":"Savannah, GA"},{"id":52776,"lat":32.7764749,"lng":-79.9310512,"zoom":8,"place":"Charleston, SC"},{"id":52777,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":8,"place":"Richmond, VA"},{"id":52778,"lat":39.2903848,"lng":-76.6121893,"zoom":8,"place":"Baltimore, MD"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"},{"id":52780,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"id":52781,"lat":42.3600825,"lng":-71.0588801,"zoom":8,"place":"Boston, MA"},{"id":52782,"lat":43.661471,"lng":-70.2553259,"zoom":8,"place":"Portland, ME"},{"id":52783,"lat":45.2733153,"lng":-66.0633081,"zoom":8,"place":"St John, NB, Canada"},{"id":52784,"lat":44.9902861,"lng":-64.1310364,"zoom":8,"place":"Windsor, NS, Canada"},{"id":52785,"lat":44.6488625,"lng":-63.5753196,"zoom":8,"place":"Halifax, NS, Canada"},{"id":52786,"lat":53.4083714,"lng":-2.9915726,"zoom":8,"place":"Liverpool, UK"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":501,"tag":"Escaping slavery"},{"id":2306,"tag":"Slave narratives"},{"id":420,"tag":"Slaves"},{"id":2737,"tag":"Civil War era"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6388,"title":"William Green's Journey Towards Becoming a Freeman","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From the beginning of his life, William Green’s freedom was taken from him. William Green was born in Oxford Neck, Maryland about three months before his mother was set free. Green’s owner, Miss Goldsbury, at her death set all of her slaves free and their children were to be free when they became of age. William Green was therefore entitled to his freedom at the age of twenty-five, but he was cheated out of it. When Miss Goldsbury died Green fell into the hands of Mr. Singleton. Mr. Singleton, was going to take Green to the South to sell him, but Green’s mother begged him not to take her son away. He agreed that if she found someone to buy Green that he would sell him to them. Edward Hamilton bought Green and when he was sold the fact that Green was to be free at the age of twenty-five was not mentioned and therefore Green was sold as a slave for life. Green lived with his mother until he turned nine, at which time he was taken to work in the house of Mr. Hamilton. Until he was twenty, Green worked in Mr. Hamilton’s house as a body-servant, a race-rider, and later a waiter. When Mr. Hamilton’s daughter, Miss Henrietta Hamilton, married Dr. Jenkings, Green was given as part of her wedding dowry. Dr. Jenkings was a disagreeable man and Green did not like him. Green’s job was to wait and take care of things in the house, go on errands, and ride with the doctor when he went to see patients. One day, Green got into a quarrel with the doctor over how Green spent his leisure time. The doctor cracked a whip at Green and they started to fight until they were both out of breath. After that, Green told Dr. Jenkings that if he ever whipped him again Green would never do another day’s work for him or any other man. Green would remain with the doctor for about a year following the incident. Green was not satisfied with being a slave and had decided that he “had spent as much time in slavery as he was willing to” (Green, 15) and made a plan to escape with his friend, Joseph. On their journey, Green and Joseph met many friends who aided them on their way towards freedom. They were able to make it to New York and later Springfield, Massachusetts where Green was able to get a job, settle down, and live the life of a freeman.","William Green was not satisfied with being a slave and he was willing to stand up for himself and his freedom. Saidiya Hartman writes in her book <em>Scenes of Subjection</em> that “the exercise of power was inseparable from its display because domination depended upon demonstrations of the slaveholder’s dominion and the captive’s abasement. The owner’s display of mastery was just as important as the legal title to slave property.” A slaveholder showing his power was essential to his domination. Many people believed that slaves were suppose to submit to white people and that it was their job to do so. Dr. Jenkings was not able to exercise complete domination and power over William Green. This is because Green had been apart of Mrs. Jenkings dowry, so he was not one of the Doctor’s slaves and was not his property. Green was one of Mrs. Jenking’s favorite slaves and she had some influence in the way that Green was treated and often “let him have his way.” (Green, 13) With Dr. Jenkings not being able to have complete domination over Green, Green developed the courage to stand up for himself and this was shown with Green’s willingness to disobey his owner and when he told Dr. Jenkings that he would never work another day if he was ever whipped again. When Hartman talks about the brutality of slavery, two of things that she mentions are cruelty and resistance. William Green experienced both of these.  Examples of the cruelty that Green experienced was when he was cheated out of his freedom by being sold as a slave for life and not one who would be free at the age of twenty-five and the way that Green was treated by Dr. Jenkings. Even though Green was dominated and treated with brutality by his masters Green was not afraid to stand up for himself and resist them. Green’s courage grew as he resisted against his master and the act of slavery and as he began to think about freedom. With this courage Green made the decision to run away. It took “all of the nerve and energy that a poor slave can bring to his support to enable him to make up his mind to leave in the precarious manner” (Green, 15) but Green was willing to do so and because of this he was able to become a freeman. "," "],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":52791,"lat":42.1014831,"lng":-72.589811,"zoom":8,"place":"Springfield, Massachusetts"},{"id":52769,"lat":39.0457549,"lng":-76.6412712,"zoom":8,"place":"Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6404,"title":"Coming South: A Confederate Sympathizer in a Northern State","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-14","end_date":"1860-12-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Just days before South Carolina seceded from the United States in December of 1860, an article titled “Coming South” was printed in a South Carolina newspaper, the <em>Abbeville Press.</em> The article included a letter written by a Northern Gentleman who wanted to support Southerner’s interests in rebelling against the abolitionist North. He believed that the South had been tolerant of the North’s tyranny for too long, and that the Southern states should rebel against the Union. The letter was originally addressed to a large commercial house in Mobile, Alabama, and it discussed the mounting political tensions at the time of publication between the Northern abolitionist states and the Southern pro-slavery states. The author of the letter stated that he was always a believer in the “divine and legal right of slavery,” and in state’s right of secession, and his beliefs made him an outlier in the North. Because secession seemed likely, the author wanted to express his support for the state’s right to secede, and for his desire to conduct business with or even migrate to the South in the event of secession. The author had accumulated land and wealth, and also produced goods that were exclusive to northern states, which would be valuable to the cotton states. The author claimed that if the Southern Confederacy was created as its own union, his first priority would have been to defend that right to secede, and his second would have been to help establish trade between the Confederacy and Europe, both of which would have been essential to fostering the Confederacy’s independence. The author chose to side with the South, because he believed fundamentally in the right to own slaves, to trade freely, and to secede if these rights were infringed upon.","In the letter presented in “Coming South,” the author addressed the issue of secession in terms of it being the only means to protect the interests of the South. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War,</em> historian Bruce Levine discussed how Southerners believed that their position in the United States was untenable, and how the fear of abolition lead to secession (226). The letter author reflected the dominant ideology of the South at the time, because Southerners felt that in order to protect their economic interests and their existing lifestyle, it was necessary to remove themselves from a union that sought to eradicate slavery. Levine notes that antislavery sentiment had “demonstrably taken hold of a huge portion of the northern population” and that this instilled fear in the South, but the Northern letter author interestingly contrasted the dominant view of his region (233). The letter author's position as a wealthy gentelmen suggests that his interest in engaging with the South stemmed from economic concerns. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free, </em>Levine described instances of Northerners who sought to reconcile with Southern planters for the sake of economic gain, and stated that those who sided with the South were usually “key sections of the economic elite who feared alienating the slave owners more than they disliked slavery” (229). Essentially, in some instances businessmen, like the letter author, were more concerned with profiting from the Southern agricultural giants than they were with the moral aims of abolition. In \"Coming South,\" the <em>A</em><em>bbeville Press </em>used the letter to<em> </em>further the newspaper’s own pro-slavery and pro-secession agenda, by highlighting the possibility of economic and moral supprot from wealthy men in the North. The article did not give a name, location, or any identifying information about the letter’s author, so the letter could even have been a fabricated piece of propaganda, intended to encourage readers to side with secession. Southerner’s feared oppression from the majority of the North, but the existence of a pro-secession minority in the North would give Southerner’s reason to believe that they would be supported and successful if they removed themselves from the Union. Overall, the letter transcribed in “Coming South” is significant to period leading up to secession and the Civil War, because it reflected the contrast between Northern and Southern interests, and foreshadowed the eventual secession of the Southern slave states.  "," "," "],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":52809,"lat":30.6953657,"lng":-88.0398912,"zoom":8,"place":"Mobile Alabama"},{"id":52808,"lat":34.1781719,"lng":-82.3790147,"zoom":8,"place":"Abbeville South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":500,"tag":"trade"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6439,"title":"Fugitive Slave John Brown's Experience in a New Orleans Slave Pen Exposes the Horrors of the Slave Trade","course_id":145,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1840-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a typical day in a New Orleans slave pen, John Brown got called up to the flogging room—a room dedicated to punishment for slaves who misbehaved on the auction block. Here, slaves were beaten repeatedly with a long leather paddle, known as a “flog”. The “flog” delivered punishment equivalent to the whip, but did not leave wounds that could jeopardize the price of a slave. When his name was called, Brown knew that he was not wanted for punishment, but for assistance. As the men, women, and children were stripped naked and laid flat on the floor, Brown was forced to hold down their feet until the brutal torture was over.","Brown spent much of his time between sales in New Orleans hotels, banks, and stores that had been converted into slave pens. These pens were almost always full, each holding close to 500 enslaved people and always being replenished with new slaves. Inside the barred windows and concrete walls of these pens, Brown witnessed the same horrors and disgraces on a daily basis.","As each slave arrived in various conditions, they went through intense processes of grooming, which Brown described as no light business. Hairs were plucked and dyed and deformities were hidden. Slaves were stuffed with food in order to give them a healthy look. They were forced to dance to a fiddle for exercise, or dance to the whip if they refused. After these daily processes, men, women, and children were separated and “sized out” (or put in groups based on their size) once again to be prepared for the second sale of the day—the afternoon sale.","Brown described the slave pens as a brothel for young mulatto women whose fates were in the hands of buyers only wanting them to satisfy their sexual desires. Because they were forced to lie about their age to make themselves more appealing to buyers, slaves often never knew their true age They faced consequences if they did not say the age the trader chose them to be. Slaves were sent to the flogging room for what Brown considers the “unpardonable” offense of not speaking up and looking bright on the auction block. A well-made, flawless looking slave was devalued by their lack of interest or vacant stare. Brown said that the uncivilized manner in which slaves were handled and inspected epitomized the horrors on the auction block. As husbands and wives, and mothers and children watched their loved one be sold in front of them, they dare not bid a goodbye or give one last embrace, or they would be faced with severe punishment.","John Brown believed that only those who experienced slavery could tell and truly understand the horrors that happened beyond the auction rooms where the dealer is left alone with their “chattel” offered to him to buy. But he refrained from telling the most horrifying scenes he witnessed in his narrative. So, why would a freed slave, who is aspiring to educate abolitionists on the true horrors of slavery, choose to leave out the most gruesome details that defined the slave market? Historian Karen Halttunen argues that witnessing such intense cruelty puts reformers like John Brown in a difficult position. Brown omits the most painful material from his narrative in order to highlight the slave industry’s obscene nature. In Brown’s case, saying less actually says more. By stating that he is excluding the most painful details, readers are forced to think about and imagine what could possibly be worse than the horrors Brown did include. Brown introduced the very kind of painful material about the slave market that he intentionally set aside."," "],"display_date":1840,"search_date":"1840-07-01","locations":[{"id":52821,"lat":29.9510658,"lng":-90.0715323,"zoom":8,"place":"New Orleans, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"},{"id":29,"tag":"New Orleans"},{"id":2795,"tag":"slave pen"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":145,"school_id":11}},{"id":6449,"title":"Slave Experiments in the Antebellum South","course_id":145,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1840s, a Virginia slave named John Brown became a victim of a practice involving the use of slaves to further medical knowledge in the antebellum South. Originally known as Fed, Brown was sold from his master’s house in Northampton, Virginia by a slave speculator named Starling Finney. He was moved to Georgia and sold again to a man named Thomas Stevens. Fourteen years later, Stevens became very sick with a serious illness unknown to Brown. Eventually, a well-known man from Jones County named Doctor Hamilton completely restored Stevens’ health. To thank him for his work, Stevens told Hamilton to ask for anything he desired. At the time, Doctor Hamilton was interested in learning more about cures for sun-stroke. Hamilton took this opportunity to “borrow” John Brown, in order to use him for potential experiments.  Stevens carelessly left Brown with Hamilton, essentially transforming Brown’s body into both a form of payment and an experimental guinea pig.","Hamilton used Brown for a series of experiments in order to gain insight and knowledge into the human body. In his first experiment, Hamilton subjected Brown to extreme heat from a fire to induce heat stroke. Hamilton gave Brown various types of medicines and remedies, and then watched as Brown faded in and out of consciousness, until he inevitably passed out. After a period of trial and error involving various tests where Brown was exposed to unbearable temperatures, Hamilton concluded that cayenne-pepper tea was the best remedy against heat stroke. Hamilton was interested in more than scientific advancement. He marketed his discovery by selling placebo pills made of flour and told his patients and customers to dissolve them in cayenne-pepper tea, profiting from Brown’s suffering.","Doctor Hamilton’s experiments were not limited to finding cures for heat stroke. Hamilton’s various tests physically and mentally destroyed John Brown. He lost his ability to work in the field and was ultimately deemed “useless” and unwanted, leading him to find other slave work as a carpenter. As a result of these procedures, Brown made up his mind to escape, prompting him to contact Buck Hurd, a white slave stealer. Despite warnings of the extreme dangers of this process, Brown’s desperation overshadowed his judgement. He was unable to imagine anything worse than the unbearable reality of his current situation, and instead risked facing other consequences. ","            John Brown was fortunate enough to survive Hamilton’s experiments and eventually escape slavery in 1847. Brown and his story reveal the degree of abuse slaves underwent as a result of their lack of rights. His narrative is extremely telling and unsettling in terms of the mindset of certain slave holders and slave users. Slave experiments were not only an acknowledgement of general black humanity, but specifically of inarguable human similarity. Experimenting on African-American bodies in order to find ways to treat the symptoms of whites revealed Americans’ recognition of the likenesses between all of them. Unfortunately, John Brown’s case was far from unique. The exploitation of slaves was both a common and generally accepted practice in the South. In his narrative Brown wrote, “The little I have told may afford an insight into the system of Slavery, but it is only a ‘small peep.’ I have suffered enough myself, but others have endured and are daily enduring, perhaps, much more.”"],"display_date":"1840 - 1845","search_date":"1842-12-31","locations":[{"id":52795,"lat":32.1656221,"lng":-82.9000751,"zoom":8,"place":"Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":2839,"tag":"Experiments"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":145,"school_id":11}},{"id":6450,"title":"To My Loving Miss Patsy","course_id":145,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-08-29","end_date":"1857-08-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Writing, “To My Loving Miss Patsy,” in a letter in August 1857, Vilet Lester began by explaining that:","“I have long been wishing to embrace this present and pleasant opportunity of unfolding my feelings since I was constrained to leave my long loved home.”","Lester had had four masters since she left the Pattersons’ home and desperately missed those that she had left behind, including but not limited to, her mother, brothers, and sister.  However, most of all, she desperately needed to know where her daughter was because her current owner, Mr. Lester, had promised to reunite the two.  She implored Patsey to write her back as soon as possible so that she could try and piece together that relationship"," First hand accounts written by slaves are rare.  Yes, we have slave narratives but these people were remembering what happened to them.  Letters, instead, give a glimpse into what enslaved people were experiencing at that very point in their lives.  Since it was illegal to teach a slave to read and write, few slaves wrote letters and fewer survived."," Unlike some other letters, Lester actually wrote this letter without assistance.  At this time,  masters often taught their slaves to read so that they could read the Bible. This fed the misconception that slave masters were more like father-figures than abusers.  However, they would often only teach slaves to read and not write. Therefore, it is notable that Vilet learned how to write as well.  There were also pragmatic reasons, like needing a slave to read in order to do errands.  Finally, some owners just believed in the virtue of education."," “My dear mistress I cannot tell my feelings nor how bad I wish to see you”. Vilet continued.  In this case, Lester wrote in a seemingly amicable manner. She didn’t write in the formal way in which someone would write to their boss, or even parent, but rather, it was written like she was talking to a good friend to just catch up.  This may seem strange because why would slaves look fondly upon their masters, if the grand narrative of slavery today is so often trying to debunk the myth of slaves being happy and content with their circumstances?"," Plot twist. It can be inferred that Ms. Patterson was not actually the headmistress of the plantation.  Instead, Patsey, the child of the head master and mistress of the plantation, and Vilet grew up together. Headmistresses, the female owners, were twice as likely to teach slaves to read and write than owners were. White children, in slaveholding households, were oftentimes teachers to their enslaved playmates as well.  So, the master’s kids would end up teaching slaves either in secret or without even knowing about the legality of what they were doing.  This last instance seems to fit perfectly with the correspondence of Violet to Patsey.  Instead of an enslaved person inquiring about those whom she has left behind, she was actually attempting to catch up with an old friend, and probable teacher."," Lester closed the letter as follows:","“So I must come to a close by describing myself your long loved and well wishing playmate as a servant until death. If you should think a nuff of me to right me which I do beg the favor of you as a servant direct your letter to Millray Bullock County Georgia. Please to right me So fare you well in love.”","Love is not a word that comes to up in modern discourse surrounding slavery, unless one is referring to the love that slaves had for one another.  It’s not acceptable to claim that masters loved their slaves.  However, what about the children of these households and enslaved children? Vilet mentions love five times in this letter, three of them are referring to Patsey. I suppose this just goes to show that even in the darkest of situations, a bit of light always manages to shine through."],"display_date":"August 29, 1857","search_date":"1857-08-29","locations":[{"id":52850,"lat":32.3595678,"lng":-81.7787021,"zoom":7,"place":"Bullock County, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":761,"tag":"letter"},{"id":2840,"tag":"Slave Literacy"},{"id":1609,"tag":"georgia"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":145,"school_id":11}},{"id":6451,"title":"Sexual Predation and the Slave Trade","course_id":145,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many male enslavers coveted African American women.

Being raped became a staple of life for female slave’s and many were purchased solely for the sexual fantasies of their owners.","Harriet Jacobs, a slave girl from Edenton, North Carolina, was one of the few lucky women who narrowly evaded the sexual predation common to the practice of slavery.. She left her entire life’s struggle in her autobiography, <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, written by Herself. </em>After her mother passed away, her master, Margaret Horniblow, took Harriet in. However, she was gifted to Horniblow’s niece, Mary Matilda, the daughter of Dr. Norcom. She lived with Dr. Norcom for just under twenty years during which time she, was tormented by Norcom’s unsolicited sexual advances as well as the cruel jealously of his wife. Despite constant rejection and her definite refusal to become his mistress, Norcom proved to be relentless. Jacob’s only escape from her master and his sexual predation was an escape from slavery itself, made possible by her taking another white man as a lover and hiding in a small, three-foot high cabinet for seven years. With his protection, she secretly fled the state on a train to Philadelphia after years of hiding.","However, both married and single slaves alike were subject to the advances of their owners. Bethany Veney, a slave women in Virginia, left behind her autobiography, <em>The Narrative of Bethany Veney, </em>in which she writes she knew that her decision to be with only her husband was not hers to make. She and her husband to be, Jerry, a slave from a neighboring plantation, were given the blessing of their owners to be formally wed. When the minister was marrying her and her husband, she later wrote that she, “did not want him to make us promise that we would always be true to each other, forsaking all others, as the white people do in their marriage service, because I knew that at any time our masters could compel us to break such a promise.” (Veney 18) Veney knew that as a slave women, she would always be subject to white enslavers’ sexual predation.","When examining the history of enslaved women, it is impossible to ignore the immeasurable cases of rape and sexual violence they were subject to.  These cases of abuse towards female slaves complete negate the argument of paternalism, presented in Baptist’s <em>The Half Has Never Been Told</em>, enslavers used to justify holding slaves. The constant raping of female slaves was a selfish and cowardly way for enslavers to reassure their own selves of their power. When focusing solely on the maltreatment prevalent for female slaves, the entire argument of paternalism is derailed. This is because there is no plausible way that an enslaver can believe that by raping and abusing a woman he is doing her a favor. His brutal actions are not saving her from her own inhumane tendencies, they’re breaking her. When studying the arguments of paternalism that are present in many justification arguments, one must extensively consider how rape cases and sexual violence make it hypocritical; male enslavers purchased female slaves not to take them under their wing as paternalism argues, but rather to use and abuse these women for their own selfish gains."],"display_date":"January 1, 1833 - December 27, 1858","search_date":"1845-12-29","locations":[{"id":52759,"lat":36.057938,"lng":-76.6077213,"zoom":8,"place":"Edenton, North Carolina"},{"id":52851,"lat":38.8413778,"lng":-78.5660852,"zoom":8,"place":"Shenandoah County, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":2841,"tag":"Rape and Slavery"},{"id":2842,"tag":"Female Slave Abuse"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":145,"school_id":11}},{"id":6587,"title":"Edward Gorsuch and his Southern posse defeated at Christiana","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-09-11","end_date":"1851-09-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 11, 1851, Edward Gorsuch, a Maryland slave owner, and a posse of several men including Federal Marshal Kline, descended upon the house of William Parker, in search of escaped slaves.

However, the small Quaker town of Christiana in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and its inhabitants were prepared to fight for their own lives and for the escaped bondsmen they desired to protect .","Upon following a suspected ex-slave named Joshua Kite to the home of William Parker, a confrontation ensued. Parker forcefully refused to cooperate with those in the posse, as he recalled his conversation with Marshal Kline, “I then told him to take another step, and I would break his neck.” Worried over what events may occur, William Parker’s wife blew a horn in hopes of alerting nearby townsfolk to aid them in protecting the escaped slaves. Following the call for assistance, there came an exchange of gun shots between the southerners and those at the home of William Parker, which left no individuals harmed.

Slaughter believes the concept of support from Hanway and Lewis can be attributed to their white skin color, as members of the posse viewed them as allies, united against their African-American enemies. Upon refusing to assist Edward Gorsuch and his group, the two northern men began advising the Maryland posse to leave because their safety was at risk. Following the further denial of the southern men to leave, a swift and murderous battle ensued, resulting in the death of Edward Gorsuch and the critical injury of his son Dickinson Gorsuch. “Old Gorsuch was lying in the yard in a pool of blood,” specified William Parker, “and confusion reigned both inside and outside of the house.” From this battle, a large Federal trial took place, in hopes of bringing justice to those involved in the conflict. However, according to James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, the government dropped the indictments of the individuals involved and decided not to press any further charges.

These battles gave Kansas the name, “Bleeding Kansas,” which was appropriate due to all the bloodshed. This “unnamed free-statesman” joined the other paramilitary abolitionists because he had no choice due to where he was in Kansas. Everyone else in that section of Kansas felt compelled to join groups of one side or the other to help protect their towns and other citizens that were being pillaged.

However, “a servant prompted by attachment to his master, communicated to him that he had been requested to give his assent and subscribe his name to a list of persons already engaged in the conspiracy.” Vesey and thirty-four others were executed, by South Carolina, for their plans of treason against the white population of the United States.","Vesey, a literate free black man living in Charleston, bought his freedom in 1800. Years later, he learned about the successful Haitian slave revolt, which inspired him to plan a similar event in the United States. In the year 1817, he joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in Charleston, along with around 4,000 blacks who left white churches. Upon his association with the church, he quickly became a leader and realized that the whites in the area targeted those who attended the church; this greatly angered Vesey. As a result, he began to preach from the Old Testament, and he taught that the blacks who attended were the new chosen ones and because of their enslavement, those who forced them into this lifestyle would be punished. By getting his supporters into the mindset that whites deserved to be punished, he encouraged them to support his plan for rebellion.","<em> Narrative of the Events Comprising the Vesey </em>Rebellion states, around 1818, “Vesey considered leaving Charleston…but he decided to stay and see what he could do for his fellow creatures. With a new urgency he preached that freedom for slaves would be realized.” Vesey and his fellow leaders began to plan for a rebellion. Gullah Jack, an African Priest, teamed with Vesey to spread the word of the rebellion and to inspire potential participants. The date for the rebellion was set for July 14, 1822. The plan was to seize the city of Charleston, set fire to the city, kill the governor, and basically every white man in sight.","Denmark Vesey became a martyr to his followers and those to come after him. He assisted in planning a rebellion that could have changed the fate of many slaves and free blacks. David Robertson believes that Vesey \"organized the most elaborate and well-planned slave insurrection in the history of the United States.\" Robertson believes that if he had succeeded the majority of whites in Charleston could have been wiped out. Not only would this have changed their lives, it also would have changed the lives of the white population. With the threat of this possible rebellion, the South realized that they needed to keep a closer eye on the black population. His actions and the results gained support for the abolitionist movement, and the country of the United States began to move closer and closer to a Civil War."," "],"display_date":"May 1, 1822 - July 14, 1822","search_date":"1822-06-07","locations":[{"id":52976,"lat":32.7764749,"lng":-79.9310512,"zoom":8,"place":"Charleston, South Carolina, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":3142,"tag":"Revolt"},{"id":2743,"tag":"Abolitionist"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1018,"tag":"rebellion"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6647,"title":"A Portrait of Failure","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-10-16","end_date":"1859-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["This portrait of John Brown, the leader of the Raid on Harper’s Ferry in October of 1859, was drawn by an artist named David Hunter Strother after John Brown’s execution. and was published in Harper’s Weekly in June of 1866 and April of 1868. This was seen as important because it caused remembrance of the situation of Harper’s Ferry and how it was a key event in the Abolition of Slavery and the start of the Civil War. The other source used recounts how troubled past of the Brown family. It is an excerpt from an essay, by a professor named  Robert E. McGlone of the University of Hawaii, called Rescripting a Troubled Past: John Brown's Family and the Harpers Ferry Conspiracy, which was published in the Journal Of American History.","Going back to October of the year 1859, abolitionist John Brown, alongside other abolitionists, crossed the border of Maryland into Virginia. Brown took control of an United States arsenal at Harper’s Ferry. His hope was to arm slaves and have them break free. His mission, ultimately a failure as General Robert E. Lee and his platoon of Marines thwarted Brown’s plans and captured him, whilst killing off most of his men including Brown’s two sons. This ultimately led to Brown being tried for treason against the state of Virginia. The governor at the time, Henry A. Wise, gave permission for Brown to be hanged after finding him guilty. Finding him guilty, ultimately ended the cause according the McGlone’s essay.","Robert E. McGlone’s article praises Brown’s efforts for the abolition of slavery. He calls him a martyr for the cause. He praises his family for also being for this cause. His sons, Watson and Oliver, were also martyrs for this cause since they were killed during the firefight. McGlone also spoke on how the Browns came from nothing. They did not want credit for their doings, they just wanted slavery to be done with. He went on to talk about how the family did not receive any sort of credit. Their cause died with John Brown’s failure. Why should this receive any attention? They are saying this needs to receive attention because it pushed the nation into the direction of war between these two sides.","These events caused a huge stir in the South. Slave owners were terrified of something like this happening tothem. It also caused a discourse amongst political leaders. It stirred up massive amounts of tension between freestates and slave states. This also was a cause that called the attention to state laws and federal laws, and whichone overruled the other. Although this was not a key event to starting what later would be called the Civil War, itwas a push in that direction. This event more or less sounded a warning alarm of what was to come in the nextdecade. The portrait used was used to keep Brown’s cause alive.

Brown believed that the use of violence and arming slaves would be the only way to overthrow slavery. On October 16, 1859, Brown led twenty-one men on a violent raid on the federal government at Harper's Ferry, Virginia (now known as West Virginia) in the attempt to abolish slavery. Due to his vicious acts to end slavery, Brown was referred to as a “terrorist” in America especially in slaveholding states. Even though, Brown’s attack on Harper’s Ferry was an unsuccessful event on the attempt to end slavery. It became a monumental event for the abolitionist movement and made Brown a historical hero.","                          Brown was born in 1800, to a deeply religious family with a father who opposed to the idea of slavery. As a young boy, Brown and his family moved to Ohio state because of the state antislavery views. With his father’s influence, he believed that the rights of an America citizen applied to all no matter the color of person’s skin. He felt that all people should be free and treated equally with respect despite their position. His fight to end slavery was led on basis that “evil should be ended by any means necessary” no matter the consequences.","Even as a grown adult, Brown was still devoted to causes he believed in which led him to finance the David Walker's Appeal and Henry Highland's \"Call to Rebellion\" speech publication. He also gave land to fugitive slaves and began to raise young black children as his own with his wife. He was also heavily active in the Underground Railroad helping many slaves from the South to Canada. In 1847, Frederick Douglass stated that “ though he’s a white gentleman...Brown deeply interested in our cause, as his soul has been pierced by slavery.” It was at the meeting where Brown discussed his plan on a war to free slaves.","                          In 1851, Brown helped found the League of Gilead, an organization that worked to protect escaped slaves from slaves catchers. League of Gilead was created as a reaction to Congress Fugitive Slave Act, which gave slave owners the use of federal law enforcement powers to go to the North, to seek the return of escaped of slaves. He did not become a well-known historical activist until 1855 until he came to Kansas despite his other many antislavery acts. He became a leader of anti-slavery guerillas and fought in a war against proslavery in Lawrence, Kansas. He continues to fight pro-slavery towns by brutally killing five residents after his first attack for the rest of the year.","  Brown attack on Harper’s Ferry where he raided the town with five black and sixteen white armed men came to an end. When local farmers and army men led by Robert E. Lee ended the attack after thirty-six hours, most of Brown’s men were killed or captured. Brown was wounded and captured and put on trial in the town of Charleston, Virginia(now known as West Virginia).After being found guilty, Brown was hanged on December 2, 1859, for the attack.

This document was the first major action in getting rid of the institution of slavery in the United States. Though Abraham Lincoln did not receive open arms when creating this document, he did bring a new since of freedom to the African Americans in the country. This document had two sides, one side believed that it was time to take action and to win the war they needed to get rid of the one thing the south was fighting for. And the other side stood against it, they thought that getting rid of slavery was a wrong move and believed they were just ripping apart the country even more.","            The effects of this document brought many questions and many new ideas to the United States. In the document Lincoln States “All persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.” In the first sentence Lincoln jumps right in to the fire and does what he was there to do. Though there can be an argument made that Lincoln technically has no jurisdiction to free the slaves in the south. This document still shocked the minds of many people both in the union and the confederacy. Many northerners believed the idea of freeing all the slaves would hurt the country.","            Other than controversies, this document did bring a lot of good and a new since of freedom. This document did give birth to the African American man in the Union and chance to join the army.  Lincoln stated “I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.” During this time the union was experiencing huge casualties on the battlefield. The freed slaves gave the Union the numbers it needed to keep the war going and help continue the pursuit against the Confederacy. Throughout the progression of the war slavery was a grey area, though people knew this institution generally caused the war they did not know how to handle the topic. Abolition did not come into picture until Lincoln realized that he had to take away the one think the Confederacy was holding on too."," ","            To conclude, the Emancipation Proclamation helped bring a shifting point to the American Civil War. After mass causalities and a happening of an immoral institution weighed heavier than it could have ever, Lincoln realized that he needed to take action.

Life was going well and Ellison wanted to update his son on how things were going at home. John, one of Ellison’s 53 slaves had just been to the river to collect payment from a number of white slaveowners for the cotton gins they had purchased from Mr. Ellison. He came back with no money at the end of the day though. Ellison’s customers had either made excuses such as wanting to consult their overseer before paying or had not been where they said they would be. There was no frustration in Ellison’s tone as though this is something that he has had to deal with before. He then gave instructions to his son to purchase a number of farming tools that would inevitably be used in the fields by his slaves. He gave a brief farewell and ended the letter.","This same type of letter may have been sent a thousand times from a slaveholding father to his slaveholding son in mid nineteenth century American South. But William Ellison and his son, Henry Ellison, were different. William Ellison was African American, born into slavery in April of 1790 with the name April Ellison to a slave mother and white slavemaster father, Mr. William Ellison. As a young man he was apprenticed to a cotton gin maker rather than working in the fields and allowed to keep a portion of the wages he earned for his master and father, money that he later used to purchase his freedom. At the same time, he changed his name to William Ellison, after his father, to fit in with higher society. After purchasing his family, he moved to Sumter County, South Carolina and hired out other free African Americans to work in his cotton gin shop. While working, he discovered a common problem among freed slaves in the South. The expense of wages left him with a profit that would never compete with what slaveowners were earning. Wanting to move up in society, he purchased his first slaves in 1820.","By 1850, Ellison had 37 slaves while his sons owned another 16. He was one of about 180 black slave masters in South Carolina at the time, most of whom were former slaves themselves. Like Ellison, they realized that the only way to get out of the lower middle class that so many freed blacks were stuck in, was slave labor. With nearly 9,000 free blacks in South Carolina, that 180 made up a tiny percentage who were willing to do anything to compete with the upper class white slaveowners at the time. Just because they owned slaves though did not mean they were treated equally among slaveowners. As Ellison subtly hints in his letter, white slave owners would avoid interacting with African Americans as much as possible. Ellison provided many whites in the area with what were the best cotton gins available which meant that if they wanted to produce the most cotton, they would have to do business with them. They would often try to avoid paying him though. Despite the discrimination, blacks owning blacks continued all the way up to the Civil War, with many African American slave owners, including Ellison, contributing and supporting the Confederate side. Stories like Ellison’s and other black slave owners showed the economic power of slavery in Southern America in the nineteenth century. The easiest way to achieve financial and social success was to own slaves and the allure of southern wealth was enough that it convinced a few of slavery’s former victims to switch to the other side."," "],"display_date":"March 26, 1857","search_date":"1857-03-26","locations":[{"id":53057,"lat":33.9123048,"lng":-80.4103957,"zoom":8,"place":"Sumter County, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3319,"tag":"Economic Inequality"},{"id":3318,"tag":"Free Blacks"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}},{"id":6702,"title":"The Anguish of the Auction Block","course_id":171,"status":"P","start_date":"1780-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Slaves were often required to surrender their bodies, the vessel that encapsulated their freedom and individuality, to the ownership of their master. Their bodies constantly fell victim to the harsh and violent hands of white men, but a heightened vulnerability was present when a slave was dragged to the auction block, bound by chains. The fate of a slave’s future was placed in the hands of white men, giving the man with the winning bid the ability to reshape their entire identity and even dictate familial and romantic relations among them. The auction block was the battleground at which a slave’s future was put up for sale and families were most susceptible to separation.","Charles Ball, as well as many other African Americans during this time, experienced just that. He was forced into a life under the constraints of a white slave owner who, with an unyielding fist, immediately claimed him as property. No input from Charles was needed. With one swift grab of the collar, Charles was instructed that he would be going to Georgia without the accompaniment of his wife and children. Through the power of his relentless grip, a white man was able to reinvent Charles’ identity and uproot his entire life to move him to a different state. Without a second thought, Charles was taken away from his family, the people who were the core of his identity.","Silenced under the command of a white slave owner, Charles Ball timidly voiced one question. He asked about his wife and children, and he asked if they would be allowed to see each other. His question was answered immediately and unsympathetically; he would be able to get a new wife when he got to Georgia. He must have understood that he did not have much voice in this matter and he must have remembered the consequences of resistance. Maybe he had a flashback of being separated from his own mother who Charles remembers “turned to him [the slave buyer] and cried, ‘Oh, master, do not take me from my child!’” The slave master immediately struck her multiple times and dragged her back to the auction block for sale. Charles must have known that any efforts of resistance would be futile. He learned from a young age, just as many children that grew up in the shackles of slavery did, that they would not be given the luxury to love nor would they be permitted the freedom of consistent companionship.","This story, however, is not unique to Charles Ball. In fact, Lewis Clarke, a former slave said, “I never knew a whole family to live together till all were grown up in my life.” There were millions of stories of families being torn apart just like Charles Ball was dragged away from his. Slaves did not have ownership of themselves, but rather they were under the control of other human beings. They were considered property and commodities, unable to legally marry or claim ownership of their children. With no protection from the law, slave traders and owners faced no opposition in splitting apart families, and that is exactly what happened time and time again.","The fate of a slave was dependent on the desires of their master, allowing the slaves no stability or security in interpersonal relationships. The threat of familial separation constantly loomed over the heads of slaves, but this anguish and uncertainty was further intensified at the auction block. At the auction block, slaves’ entire lives were put up for sale and their futures were governed by the personal motives of the white bidders surrounding them."],"display_date":"1780 - 1850","search_date":"1815-07-02","locations":[{"id":52769,"lat":39.0457549,"lng":-76.6412712,"zoom":11,"place":"Maryland"},{"id":52795,"lat":32.1656221,"lng":-82.9000751,"zoom":11,"place":"Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":2749,"tag":"Slave Family"},{"id":3323,"tag":"slave seperation"},{"id":3324,"tag":"slave auction"},{"id":3325,"tag":"Charles Ball"},{"id":3326,"tag":"slave marriage"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}},{"id":6718,"title":"Green Grass, Dark Nights","course_id":171,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"1/1/48","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            One morning while playing on the woodpile, five year old Charles Grandy was approached by his slaveholder who sternly said to him, “Boy, do you see this grass growing along the side of the fence? Well pull it all up.” Grandy, who was born into slavery, dutifully pulled all of the grass out. Immediately after finishing the task his master assigned to him, Grandy was carried to the fields where the cotton and other crops were growing, and he was instructed to pull out all the grass growing near the crops as well. Due to Grandy’s young age, he was not allowed to use any of the gardening tools, so all of the manual labor the little boy was forced to do was done by hand. From that day forward, Charles Grandy’s days of playing were replaced with the daily task of removing all of the grass and weeds growing near the crops on the plantation. ","            Typically, children born into slavery were not immediately aware that they were enslaved. Often there was a specific moment or event that showed the child that he or she was not free. The average age for children to recognize their servility was in between the ages of six and ten. It is possible that when Grandy’s master told him to pull out the grass, Grandy realized that he was under another person’s control. Prior to being forced to work, Grandy would play around the big plantation house during the day. Occasionally he would be asked to do small errands; however, one may conclude that he did not realize he was doing those small errands due to his enslavement. Grandy’s experience of being forced to pull out grass is representative of the experiences of many other enslaved children who became aware at very young ages that they were owned by another person. ","Charles Grandy shaped and was shaped by history. The experiences that he shared have formed what we know about enslaved children’s struggles.

Much of their discussion, according to the minutes of the meeting, focused on the nuances of traditional Brethren theology in terms of worldliness, alcohol use, nonresistance, feet washing, service language, and the like. Additionally, the topic of slavery appeared in their annual discourse. The elders made their position clear, saying “it would be best for a follower of Jesus Christ to have nothing at all to do with slavery.” They forbade both owning and hiring slaves. The committee also considered admitting African Americans into the church. While the decision to admit free blacks into the church was left to individual congregations, the committee made certain that if they were admitted they would be treated as equals to whites, asserting that the love of God “makes no distinction in the brotherhood” according to race.","At the time of this meeting, the slavery crisis in the United States divided religious denominations. At the start of the nineteenth century, the Second Great Awaking set a spark among Protestants in the North. According to historian James McPherson, this revival created numerous reforms and a collective conscience among New England’s Protestants. Slavery was deemed a sin and religion-based abolitionism flared up. Many Protestants in the South moved increasingly in the opposite direction, developing biblical defenses of their “peculiar institution”. As a result of these sectional divisions over slavery, in 1844 the Methodists, followed by the Baptists in 1845, and the Presbyterians in 1858, were torn into separate factions, North and South.","Although written some 157 years after the first organized Anabaptist criticism of slavery, this denomination-wide decision contrasts sharply with those of other American Protestants. The Brethren became unified. While some Brethren had individually denounced slavery, others did own slaves. The denomination also crossed sectional lines, existing both above and below the Mason-Dixon Line. According to the previous year’s meeting minutes, the elders accepted an invitation from the Roanoke, Virginia congregation. It is unclear why exactly they selected this locale, but it provided the perfect setting to discuss the question of slavery. They discussed the immorality of slavery in the home of that institution. By adopting the resolution in Virginia, there could be no question that slave state Brethren were included. In addition, to soothe possible divides, the elders selected a softer stance on the integration of free blacks. Although the elders felt all men were created equal and that it would be best for all to accept them into the church, they left it up to individual congregations and offered some mercy to those who were “weak in the faith.” By clarifying the Brethren’s stance on slavery and racial equality, this 1845 meeting placed the Brethren squarely in the court of abolitionism in the wake of national division."],"display_date":"May 9, 1845 - May 10, 1845","search_date":"1845-05-09","locations":[{"id":53156,"lat":37.2467123,"lng":-80.1205256,"zoom":6,"place":"Roanoke County, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":3615,"tag":"Protestants/Anabaptists"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6836,"title":"Alph's Lynching","course_id":187,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-15","end_date":"1849-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","In December of 1849, it was reported that an enslaved man by the name of Alph had been lynched for the murder of his owner, James Crawford.

If Alph did in fact commit the murder, it is suspected that he wished to prevent the being separated from his wife, who was to remain in Arkansas. ","Alph may not have been guilty of his crime because as he prepared for his execution, he pointed to a white man in the crowd that had gathered for the spectacle and said that he “instigated him to the crime.”  This claim did nothing to prevent the execution of Alph, who was still lynched without a proper trial. Alph ultimately sacrificed his life while taking extreme measures to remain with his wife. He was treated no differently than other slaves who were suspected of committing crimes, such as Nat Turner whose body was dismembered by an angry mob after his public execution. Similar to those responsible for the death of Alph, these people faced no repercussions for their brutal actions. ","When mob violence, that often ended in murder, is examined further it is questioned why these people failed at their job of bringing these suspected felons in for trail. When these groups went out looking for black criminals they were supposed to help the police and bring these suspected these suspected criminals in for justice. The reality was the they were more than prepared and willing to cary out acts that would result in these people’s death. These mobs, without consequence, took out their anger out on these slaves and used them as examples to make sure that the other slaves in the community saw the brutal reality if they had any ideas to take actions similar to their peers. Whites in the American South deeply feared slave rebellions, and they punish any violent act by enslaved men and women swiftly, decisively, and often quite publicly. While Alph could have been the inspiration for other slaves to rise up and rebel against their owners, instead his public execution made them realize the strict and harsh punishments that they could face if they considered such actions."," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"October 15, 1849 - October 20, 1849","search_date":"1849-10-17","locations":[{"id":53165,"lat":31.434000989729,"lng":-84.17534362349,"zoom":5,"place":"Bentonville, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3643,"tag":"mob violence"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":187,"school_id":11}},{"id":6840,"title":"The Effects of Family Separations","course_id":187,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-01-18","end_date":"1855-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On January 18, 1855, a writer for the New York Tribune went to New Orleans in order to write an article about a slave auction. While at the auction, the writer witnessed some sales, but he describes the sale that separated a mother from her child as the most upsetting. When they were brought up to be auctioned, the auctioneer offered for them to be sold together. However, the lack of responses from buyers caused them to be sold separately. The mother would end up going to Texas, and her son, Jimmie, to Missouri. The writer describes the moment of separation as one of the most horrific events in his life, the mother wailing and begging for her new master to buy her son, all to no avail. The actual moment of separation between mother and son showed the trauma they experience, both yelling and crying, knowing they would never see each other again.","Family separations occurred regularly during the slave trade. Buyers and sellers paid no mind to keeping families together while making a transaction. The only thing they were worried about was the profit that they could make. Family members, like Jimmie’s mother, would plead for buyers to keep their family together, but often wouldn’t sway their masters. While this story depicts a family separation at an auction, some families could be separated unexpectedly. This could be due to the death of an owner, or just a random sale that took place at a home, where a slave could just taken with no clue that a sale even happened. "," ","The impacts of family separation were long lasting, as these separations would devastate these enslaved people who held family in such high regard. Historian Diane Sommerville talks about the impacts of family separation, as well as other traumatic events experienced by slaves. She says that the centrality of family and community among the slaves would hinder the trauma of everyday slavery. However, Sommerville also says that this stress on the importance of family means that slaves would turn to suicide when dealing with separation from a family. Women, specifically mothers, make a large number of the suicides that are attributed to separation of families. Abolitionists often took stories of family separation and published or spread them with the attempt to gain support for their movement. The story Jimmie and his mother spread across the North through newspapers and preachers. Suicide was often a part of these family separation stories, and wasn’t considered an issue that slaves dealt with until stories began to spread. While it isn’t known what happened to Jimmie and his mother, they suffered extreme trauma from being separated, the same kind of trauma that caused many slaves to commit suicide."],"display_date":"January 18, 1855","search_date":"1855-01-18","locations":[{"id":52890,"lat":30.022691007754,"lng":-90.251417687389,"zoom":8,"place":"New Orleans"}],"tags":[{"id":3630,"tag":"Family Separation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":187,"school_id":11}},{"id":6843,"title":"Henry Bibb and The Chamelon Effect: The Ever Changing Survival Instinct and Manipulation of a Sale","course_id":187,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["After months of traveling with his new masters, Henry Bibb had finally gotten the chance he had been waiting for: a chance at escape. After enduring a brutal and sadistic master who had beaten and lashed Bibb many times, taken out his anger on Bibb’s wife through attempted sexual assault and beatings, as well as refusing to show Bibb’s family mercy after his sale by refusing to sell the family together, Bibb had prioritized escaping north by any means necessary. However, unlike his prior master, Bibb’s new owners took pity on the slave and his circumstances by offering him a deal in exchange for his cooperation. As a reward for his obedience and assisting his new masters in their efforts to sell him, the group of gamblers promised to give him a percentage of his sale as well as directions to Canada. ","Up until this point, Bibb had been told to act intelligent and demonstrate his potential value. Yet, this tactic proved unsuccessful and resulted in nobody wanting to purchase Bibb. After striking their deal, Bibb’s owners advised him to appear stupid and not very intelligent, but must be ready to spring into action if he observes a potential buyer that he was interested in.","During his time among the Cherokee Indian Territories, although not directly identified as a modern location within the U.S, Bibb found the man he was looking for: an Indian slave owner who had taken a keen interest in purchasing Bibb. This potential buyer stood out to Bibb for two major reasons. The first being that Bibb believed he could escape with fewer issues from an Indian man rather than a white man; believing that a man of Indian heritage wouldn’t be able to garner the support of white men to hunt Bibb down. The second being that the man wanted Bibb as a “body servant” and he believed this role would be less intense than working the fields. Additionally, Bibb’s owners informed him that this particular plantation was a very easy location to escape from. After understanding what this buyer could provide him, Bibb did everything he could to secure the sale by appealing to what his potential master was looking for in order to facilitate his journey towards freedom.","This identification and analysis of future buyers was a common tactic throughout the slave market. Just as buyers analyzed their future property based upon appearance and physical qualities, slaves were breaking down and analyzing their future masters based upon the clothes they wore, how they spoke, what they were looking for, and the potential future they could give the slave. Once the desires of particular masters were identified, slaves could attempt, at extremely high personal risk, to manipulate the sale choose their masters for themselves. If told to act a certain way or not speak at all, slaves could ignore those commands and present themselves in a way that would aid them in coming out on top of the system that had enslaved them. ","By describing what he saw in his future master, Bibb was able to give his audience a glance into what slaves were forced to do in order to survive the brutal world they inhabited. By transforming into whatever a particular buyer wanted, slaves could ensure their survival to a certain degree. Bibb was eventually able to escape to the Northern territories where he, at great risk of being recaptured, published his slave narrative and spread his story.","<br />"],"display_date":"1834 - 1849","search_date":"1841-12-31","locations":[{"id":53169,"lat":38.3560025,"lng":-85.4788065,"zoom":2,"place":"Oldham County, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":3637,"tag":"Human Trafficking"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":187,"school_id":11}},{"id":6844,"title":"The Aftermath of Freedom - Henry Bibb's letter to William Gatewood","course_id":187,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-03-23","end_date":"1844-03-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 23, 1844,  Henry Bibb wrote a confusing letter to the man who once owned him, William Gatewood, updating Gatewood on what life looked like after he escaped slavery. In his letter, Bibb offered forgiveness to Gatewood for the horrendous violence exacted on his wife, his infant child, and himself. Bibb said that slavery was a norm in the South, but the freedom afforded to him in the North and Canada left no reason not to forgive his master. ","Though he claimed that he held no grudges, Bibb’s detailed account of Gatewood’s actions was very damming. He repeatedly brought up the pain and suffering that Bibb and his family had to deal with under Gatewood’s enslavement. He recalled helplessly witnessing his wife being whipped, along with his infant being smacked solely for crying. The letter continues with Bibb stating that his biggest regret was not escaping sooner than he did. If Bibb was “willing to accept the past”, why bring up these disturbing memories time and time again? ","This may have been an act of moral suasion, where Bibb was trying to illuminate his compassion. Moral suasion is a concept in which morality is used in order to influence the behavior of the wealthy and politically influential people. This method, as opposed to violence, for instance, would go against the moral stance that abolitionists were trying to bring forward regarding peaceful harmony among people of all races. Furthermore, this passive approach could have been seen as less threatening to the power dynamic between the whites and blacks. Abolitionists believed that if the idea that slavery was wrong could spread to as many people as possible, any people that were willing to listen could be persuaded by universal principles backed by morality and religion. To be more specific, if slaveowners accepted the idea of moral suasion, the rivers of voluntarily liberating slaves and feeling remorseful could have run simultaneously. Perhaps abolitionists who used moral suasion believed that letters such as the one written by Bibb could be published. The probability that published work would be read by people who were influential and wealthy would also be high, such as slaveowners like Gatewood. ","In the case of this letter, Bibb may have tried to take the moral high ground and be the bigger person, in order to negate the societal acceptance of slavery by convincing Gatewood, his former slaveowner, that it was wrong. Bibb may have said that he was willing to accept the past (to Gatewood) in order to portray a calm, passive and level-headed outlook towards the slave trade. Bibb may have hoped that this would incline his very own former slaveowner, into understanding that the argument to end slavery in the United States was also a level-headed one. Perhaps a positive outlook could create a stronger abolitionist sentiment in Gatewood. In fact, he was optimistic about meeting his mother in the afterlife and boasting about other freed slaves who were thriving in Canada. Although this theoretically could have worked, abolitionists may not have anticipated how much influential people valued the role slavery played in the political, social and economic structures of the United States. Pointing out the unethical practices did not provide enough incentive to influence change in these structures.","This letter may have been Bibb’s way of acknowledging the past and embracing the pain that came along with it, before moving on to the next phase of his life as a free, black abolitionist man. It symbolized a turning point in Bibb’s life, from enslaved to freed. From chattel to “a subscriber of the oppressed, and liberty forever”. This letter also represented the continuing and carefully calculated fight for freedom even after being “freed”, showing the continuing effects that slavery had on the past, present and future of the slaves. "," "],"display_date":"March 23, 1844","search_date":"1844-03-23","locations":[{"id":53170,"lat":42.60484590151,"lng":-82.880161668612,"zoom":8,"place":"Detroit"},{"id":53171,"lat":49.330068252803,"lng":-80.155552293612,"zoom":6,"place":"West Canada"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":3666,"tag":"moral suasion"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":187,"school_id":11}},{"id":6845,"title":"Wet Nurses","course_id":187,"status":"P","start_date":"1813-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Harriet Jacobs recalled her grandmother as not only a maternal figure to her but to many other children on the plantation as well. She did something quite literally maternal: she served as a wet nurse, required to nurse numerous children on the plantation that were not her own. When sold she was marketed for her capabilities to nurse. Jacobs served many masters and nursed numerous children. While Jacobs’s life was full of years of hardships, it paralleled thousands of other women who also served as wet nurses.","Nineteenth century slavery commodified every aspect of a slave’s life, and even controlled the rights of a slave woman to her own breastmilk. In the South, about 20% of white women used wet nurses to help with their families. The wide use of wet nurses created a trading niche for their services. Advertisements for women flooded newspapers as it became an asset that many owners desired. When listed for sale, Jacob’s ability to breastfeed was listed as a “skill” just like her cooking and knitting abilities.","The lives of wet nurses, like many other slaves, had to follow strict guidelines according to their master’s wishes. Master’s would exploit a mother’s capacity to breastfeed to ensure the most profit for themselves. Jacobs was forced to wean her own daughters to ensure her master’s children were fed enough. Owners would even force slave infants to be breastfed for no more than six months so mothers could either preserve their milk for others. A wet nurse’s interaction with their own children was strictly controlled, especially after weaning. For example, at James Hammond’s plantation the rules for slave mothers and “wet nurses” showed how every aspect of motherhood and pregnancy was controlled. In the list of rules, it stated that “Sucklers’” or women that were feeding children were only allowed, “45 minutes at each nursing to be with their children. They return three times a day until their infants are three months old-in the middle of the forenoon, at noon, in the middle of the afternoon.” These women were also expected to complete a full day of work. While their time with their child was limited, once a child was completely weened they were given to an entirely different woman. Those who were allowed to stay with their child at night often had to bottle-feed their own children since others on the farm were prioritized over their own. Women who were capable often suffered from exhaustion and extreme pain, as their body was not meant to nurse so many children. Many slave’s recounted that when not able to nurse their own hindered the ability to create a bond between mother and child. The regimentation of a wet nurse’s day took away the natural and relaxed process that connected a mother and child and turned it into one of standardization."],"display_date":"1813 - 1897","search_date":"1855-07-02","locations":[{"id":52815,"lat":35.7595731,"lng":-79.0192997,"zoom":2,"place":"North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":3668,"tag":"wet nursing"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":187,"school_id":11}},{"id":6867,"title":"Colonization Society Meeting to Ask for Federal Money","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-01-09","end_date":"1826-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 9, 1826, in Washington, D.C., the American Colonization Society (ACS) convened to review the annual “Report of the Managers.”  William H. Fitzhugh, Esq. of Virginia, a vice president of the society, offered resolutions to expand funding options. With a task as large as removing and relocating freed blacks from the United States back to Africa, “private charity is inadequate to its full execution; that the resources of the nation and the state are required for it…” The society needed the backing of the federal government to realize its chief goal.","The society dated to 1816, and the ACS could claim many prominent members such as Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln. The ACS had one main goal; to relocate freed blacks back to Africa. As the population of enslaved Africans began to rise, the population of disenfranchised freed blacks rose as well. This growing assemblage of former slaves posed a significant stress on the predominantly white and racist society. Their main concern centered on the integration of the “inferior creatures” into society, as Samuel Hopkins, a member of the society, argued. Blacks living freely in the states, “could cause only injury to the slaves and disadvantage to the public” said Hopkins. Religious motives affirmed this massive project. Robert Finley,  a prominent figure in the society added, “The ACS was born out of religious benevolence and charity.” Claiming to be working in the name of God, freed Africans would liberate, “50 millions of people from the lowest state of ignorance and superstition, and restor[e] them to the knowledge and worship of the true God.” Using Christianity as a foundation, Elias Caldwell, another member, asserted that colonization was “a great national object and ought to be supported by the national purse.” Colonization seemed to be the only option at the time and in order for a project of this magnitude to be realized, the “national purse” needed to be opened. ","The ACS may have disapproved of slavery, but it remained blinkered by racist ideas. They justified the relocation of freed blacks as a benevolent action that solved the problem. This relocation supposedly benefited the, “American civil institutions, morals, and habits,” spread the word of God and redeemed the rest of Africa, Finley argued. Seemingly the only available option, the ACS gained supporters and momentum in antebellum South, with strong support from southern plantation owners who worried about the impact freed blacks would have on their slaves. As far as implementation, the cost of colonizing required incredible amounts of lives and money. Due to the magnitude of the project, private charity alone failed to cover the cost and thus the need for the appointment of a, “committee to draft memorials, to be immediately presented to the two houses of congress.”  Henry Clay’s campaign failed to produce grant money from the US government but the ACS received some state aid over the course of their existence. The ACS essentially disbanded after handing over their papers to the Library of Congress in 1919."],"display_date":"January 9, 1826","search_date":"1826-01-09","locations":[{"id":53200,"lat":38.880154466646,"lng":-76.949716179768,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington District of Columbia, U.S.A"}],"tags":[{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
