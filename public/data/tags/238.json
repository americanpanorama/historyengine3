The July 4, 1910 heavyweight championship bout in Reno, Nevada between the white challenger Jim Jeffries and the black champion Jack Johnson was supposed to be an easy victory for the undefeated Jeffries; his superior intellect and Anglo-Saxon masculinity were supposed to vanquish the black brute. Johnson decimated Jeffries, and race riots occurred in numerous cities. Johnson had defeated the so-called epitome of white male.

The heavyweight bout lasts only two minutes and four seconds, and “the ardor of German radio parties and café gatherings are quickly dampened.” Schmeling’s maid is so embarrassed by the fight that she keeps the news from Mrs. Schmeling. Louis avenges his earlier loss to “Unser Maxe” Schmeling and dealt a major blow to the Nazi idea of Aryan supremacy. Parties and riots break out in major cities in the United States. Louis did not “rock the boat” as his predecessor Jack Johnson and was thus loved by most of the public and labeled as an “Uncle Tom” by others. ","     In many sports, there is the strange phenomenon that many of the players are African American, while the majority of the spectators are Caucasian. This leads to a search by fans and media for “the Great White Hope” to snuff out the success of the black athlete. This anomaly leads to the media creation of racial feuds between black and white players.

This gathering was formed in such that African American women could come together and raise their voice for a cause that constantly rejected them. While slavery was still breaking the backs of black men and women in the South, Free Blacks in the North felt a duty and responsibility to promote and bring about emancipation. In a land where not only African-Americans, but women, were heavily exploited, finding ways to be heard had to be disconnected from faces that would be immediately shunned. As African American's at this time were believed to be ignorant and stupid, the movement to freedom inspired them to expand both their vocabulary and minds, which can be seen through the vast literary figures who emerged that this time. And so, rhetoric became essential, in both writing and speech. “Free Black churches, culturally specific jeremiads, slave narratives, secret schools, Black women's clubs, and Black colleges all represent an enriching merger of African American intellectual and activist concerns with writing instruction initiatives.”<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>"," ","The first day of the convention centered mostly about the immorality and inhumanity of the slave system. Religion was a huge factor for liberation, but this was not enough. African American's had to do more than prove that slavery was an act against God. On My 2<sup>nd</sup>, Elizabeth L. B. Stickney had a chance to make her statement. “Our principle, in regard prejudice against color, remains unchanged by persecution therefore... we will continue to act in accordance with out profession that the moral and intellectual character of a person... should mark the sphere in which they move. “ <sup><sup>2</sup></sup> Saying this, the means about which African American's became educated was easier in idea than"," ","in practice. Limited by resources, African American's had to learn at Black Colleges, Churches, and in their own homes. Though Slaves in southern plantations had earnest hearts and minds, their white","overseers oppressed them from most education except that which would help increase production. Free Blacks in the North were then given this civic duty. Though schools were available, many could not afford or attend them. Churches were popular, but they were in multitude and spread out. “African American's sought venues in which they could gain exposure to various subjects... as well as present their writing and oratory to critical audiences.”<sup><sup>3</sup></sup> As free African-American writers, poets, and intellectuals developed writings promoting sovereignty and could see how much their personal accounts and insights rallied people together, literary societies and conventions emerged."," ","“Place yourselves, dear friends, in our stead. We are blamed for not filling useful places in society; but give us light, give us learning, and see then what places we can occupy.”<sup><sup>4</sup></sup> Clarissa C. Lawrence from Massachusetts could not have stated this more accurately. It was not the African American that limited him or her self; in fact they were more than urgent to become integrated and educated. Sarah Douglass, a teacher and an active abolitionist from Philadelphia, appears under the minutes of the Convention as the treasurer. <sup><sup>5</sup></sup> Though she is not recorded as having spoken, only seven years earlier she gave an address before women of another literary society. As a writer, she used eloquent language stirring with passion to evoke sympathy from her audience. <sup><sup>6</sup></sup> All that occurred over those three days obviously cannot have been recorded within twelve pages, but regardless, her election as the convention's lone treasurer shows us the ideals and qualities likely held among most those who attended."," ","One of the final motions of the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women reads the following: “That we view... the efforts of young people to promote the abolition of slavery, not only because they have a tendency to improve the moral condition of mankind, but are also a stimulus to the exercise of those mighty energies of mind.”<sup><sup>7</sup></sup> In most cases, it is the youth who make the large pushes for social change. During antebellum before the American civil war, there was an explosion of emphasis on proper education and speech amongst the free African Americans of the North. With this came the multitude of schools and societies blacks had used to integrate the writings and works of their brothers and sisters. Many whites been the frontmen leading to abolition, but their sincerity could only be disconnected.

Between 1861 and 1865, about four million black slaves were freed.","In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the education of African Americans was not a main concern in the United States.

The buildings were crowded, the teachers were not as experienced and there were not as many courses offered in the curriculum. In the South, most of the education that took place with in churches.

It was only in the 1950’s when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in the case of Brown v Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Yet, it was only about forty years ago when Rollins College began to accept African American applicants. In 1965 only white students attended Rollins, five years later twenty African American students attended Rollins.","            Troy Layng was a white graduate from Rollins in the late sixties. He returned to Rollins to shockingly find a change in the student body, African American students. Layng conducted several interviews among the black students, and astonished by the active roles they played at Rollins. Among the students were; Laurence Martinez, leading scorer on the Men Basketball team, Chapel reader, nominee of the 1969 edition of Outstanding College Athletes of America along with a number of other leadership roles on campus. Anita Thomas was a member of ; Rollins Players, Steering Committee, Community Action Board and was a discussion leader in the College Preparation Week. Layng also interviewed two other African American students that were proactive during their four years at Rollins. Layng asked a series of questions concerning the student body’s perception of African American students, the advantages and disadvantages of attending Rollins, the reason or reasons why they selected Rollins, racial issues they face among the student body and faculty, and etc.","            The initial interview question was “Why did you select Rollins?” two out of the four student response were similar, they both mentioned the nice atmosphere but at the same time they both were concerned with the amount of blacks students that attended Rollins. The other two answered in another tone, one was fairly confident in her academics throughout high school and was convinced that Rollins chose her instead. Unfortunately the last student did not have Rollins or any other College in his future plans until his guidance counselor introduced Rollins as the best school in the South. Motivation and self determination was established among these students, in their academics and active roles at Rollins.","            An interesting question that was asked was “What could Rollins do to attract a greater number of black students” each response included the concern of financial aid and scholarships, appealing courses to those of color, incorporate black board members in the Admission Department and a stronger communication and interaction between white and black students especially among black students themselves. But their main disquiet was forming a better understanding among the social cooperation of both white and black students. Another major concern of the students was how the white students perceived them. The students in the interview repeatedly mention the importance of cultural mergence.   The previous questions were the most interesting to the students, they actually seemed genuinely concerned with the future of African American scholars. On the last page of the document there was a list of African American students that attended Rollins. Originally, the name of the document was “Negro Undergraduates at Rollins” but “Negro” was crossed out and “Black” was written it its place. This symbolizes the improvement of racial awareness among the student body at Rollins. The list has the year of six semesters, names of the student and class status. Interestingly enough there were only one African American student form 1964-1965, but from 1969-1970 there was a significant leap from one to about African American students.  De-segregation in the South was a huge issue. Of course whites didn’t want Blacks to attend the same schools, or have equal rights. There was a lost “promise” among the African Americans. Whites were too afraid that the Blacks would take over and fight back. Ideally this happened, but of course the blacks had a tough time voicing their opinions. The Jim Crow laws were imposed on the African Americans. [1] ","            To close the twenty African American students that attended Rollins a mere forty years ago opened the door for many other races. So many years later Rollins is still known for its academics and also recently known for the change among the student body.

When it reached its next stop no one got off, but one white man and two white women attempted to board the already packed car. The conductor, claiming there was standing room in the “negro” section, told some “negro” passengers who were standing near the entrance to move back and make room for the oncoming white passengers.  In a voice of opposition, one of the black men told the conductor to tell the white men crowding the “negro” section to move up in the car. With the tensions rising, one of the white passengers took offense to the black man's comments and set about to start a fight. The conductor moved in between them, and the black man supposedly began to hit the conductor. The conductor then told the man “if you hit me [again] I will kill you.” In a surprising turn of events, the conductor seemingly calmed the enraged man, refunded his fare, and told him to get off to “avoid further trouble.”","This was only one report among hundreds written by street car conductors about “incidents” on their cars. Acts of resistance like this one were commonplace in Birmingham during the 1940s. Conductors and white passengers alike reported these incidents sometimes at the rate of 14 a month. They could be as simple as blacks refusing when asked to move out of the white section. However, occasionally they resulted in the deaths of blacks who “violently” resisted this form of racial humiliation. Occurrences of resistance continued to rise as blacks slowly began to organize their resistance to this form of racial segregation.

Elleanor's life story was penned in her narrative, <em>Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge.</em> Elleanor was born into a very perculiar set of circumstances. Born in Rhode Island, she was the daughter of a free African-American Man and a female descendent from the Narrahganset tribe. The death of Elleanor’s mother acted as a catalyst that began Elleanor’s life of “self-government and spirited action”(2). Being born into freedom, she was granted many advantages that others of her race still did not possess. However advantageous the circumstances of her birth were, it still did not negate the inferiority of her position within society. It cannot be forgotten that Elleanor was still an African-American girl living in a highly racialized society. She was also the oldest child of the single-parent household with several siblings that needed to be taken care of. While Elleanor was not a slave in the general sense of the word, she was still a slave to the society she was born into. The death of her mother caused Elleanor to sell herself back into a institutionalized version of slavery, where Elleanor was a commodity to the people she served.","Upon the tragic death of her mother, Elleanor packed all of her belongings into a small leather rucksack, kissed each of her brothers and sisters, said goodbye to her father, and set out on a long, dirt road to seek work at the home of her mother’s former employer, the Bakers. The Bakers were an affluent Rhode Island family, who had been very fond of Elleanor's mother. Elleanor, possessing much of her mother's beauty, skill, and charms, was the natural choice for her replacement. Yet, before agreeing to the generous terms of employment that the Baker family had offered her, the ambitious ten-year-old proceeded to bargain the terms of her employment. Through this, Elleanor had placed herself in the “space between person and thing”(1). She was no longer in complete possession of of her own circumstances, and by extension was guilty of selling herself as a commodity, which could be bargained for. However, Elleanor had taken control of the situation through making her own choice of employer. She felt satisfied with the choice she had made for the Bakers maintained a level of respect for Elleanor and possessed the uncommon view of their servants as “belonging to the same great family of man”(2). Elleanor was aware that not all masters shared the same ideals as the Bakers did. Most employers maintained the practice of treating their servants as objects, instead of “accountable beings--as persons indeed, capable of independent thought, feeling, and action--susceptible alike of pleasure and pain, they are considered as the mere appendages of luxury”(2). Through choosing her own employer, power over Elleanor changed hands in Elleanor's favor.","As many faithful years with the Baker Family passed by, Elleanor continued to affect the conditions of her servitude on her own terms. After a year’s work, Elleanor requested that her weekly wages be raised to two cents. From a very young age, Elleanor learned the value of her services and herself as a commodity. From there, she set higher standards for the type of employer she was interested in working for. She was able to have control over her employment circumstances, which was a rarity for her time. She may have had to place herself back into a system she had been lucky to escape at birth, but Elleanor was able to regain control of her own personhood and avocation. She used her circumstances to carve out a place for herself within society as an individual blessed with the freedoms and liberties granted to her."," "],"display_date":"March 1794 - March 1799","search_date":"1796-09-14","locations":[{"id":15349,"lat":41.7585954468,"lng":-71.3839450728,"zoom":7,"place":"Kent, Rhode Island"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":1605,"tag":"Freed Slave"},{"id":1606,"tag":"Liberty"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5648,"title":"James L Smith, Slave and Freeman","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1881-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Autobiography of James L. Smith</em> serves as a potent reminder of the horrific conditions endured by slaves during the years leading up to the Civil War. Smith’s particular narrative gains added import because of the detailed manner in which he exhaustively recounts the daily realities of slave life. However, there are exceptional elements to the narrative as well. The fact that he learned to write well enough to publish a narrative indicates that Smith’s experiences were, in a very significant way, extraordinary. Thus, <em>The Autobiography of James L. Smith </em>serves as both a representative and unique picture of life in the antebellum South, and eventually, in the postwar North.","Smith begins his narrative by recounting a childhood accident that left him lame for life. He was then hired out to a succession of masters, performing various jobs and learning skills, serving variously as a cook on a small boat, a cobbler, and a house slave. Eventually, the skills he gained as a cobbler led him to be sold to a shoemaker in Virginia. However, Smith ran away from the South in his twenties, successfully reaching Philadelphia. His story does not end there, nor does his historical import. Smith continues to provide a valuable explanation of what life was like for a former slave, recounting prejudices that he faced in the North while looking for work. He ends his account with a detailed treatment of the role of African Americans in the Civil War, exhorting fellow writers to treat his compatriots’ role with more respect.","Smith gains particular historiographical importance when he is placed in the larger narrative of slavery in the American South. Notably, he offers a compelling counterpoint to the views expressed by Saidiya Hartman in her book, <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>. Though Hartman claims that slaves were dehumanized by their daily interactions, as well as incidents of exceptional violence, Smith is notable because of his extremely evident human characteristics that derive from his life experiences. Smith asserts independent agency in escaping from slavery, and in doing so, offers a stinging rejoinder to the claim that slaves’ identities were entirely created for them by white masters.","Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul </em>explores the slaving industry through the eyes of the New Orleans slave market. Smith never personally experienced the horrors of the market, as a man born into slavery. However, his narrative demonstrates the power of threats to be sold further south. Being sent to a slave market is depicted as the worst possible punishment that a master can inflict upon a slave. Through his depiction of the slave markets as a location of dehumanization and cruelty, Johnson demonstrates exactly why that was.","Smith concludes his personal narrative with accounts of his experiences as a preacher, his marriage, and his eventual move to Norwich, Connecticut. However, he veers from personal narrative to a reflection of the role of African Americans in the Civil War, providing a useful glimpse at early historiography regarding a subject that was, according to Smith, badly neglected in the immediate postwar period. He writes, “it is a fact to be lamented that the historians of our country speak so little about the heroic deeds of the colored troops; in fact, by some no mention is made of them at all” (Smith 113). Smith proceeds to give full voice to the neglected narrative of African-American troops in the Civil War, describing the contributions of troops from a variety of theatres, including the Western frontier. <em>The Autobiography of James L. Smith </em>thus concludes by offering one of the first historical treatments of the heroic efforts put forward by African-Americans in service of their own cause. The narrative therefore should properly take its place as a key document, one that is immensely helpful in advancing our understanding of both slave experiences on the plantation, and African-American experiences in the war effort."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1861 - January 1, 1881","search_date":"1871-01-01","locations":[{"id":13985,"lat":37.6195233772,"lng":-76.3456930418,"zoom":10,"place":"LANCASTER, Virginia"},{"id":11230,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"},{"id":398,"tag":"slavery, runaway"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5658,"title":"Stripped by Humanity: Slavery in The Antebellum South","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Imagine starvation.

Imagine having no food to fuel your weary body, but forced to work twelve-hour days in the Georgia fields under a hot, blistering, sun. Just imagine. The word is slavery: that “non-existence” of being owned by another human being without any chance of personal freedom.","Charles Ball, a slave in the Antebellum South, was forced to work all day with barely any food. Temptation overcame his rational thinking as he purloined a sheep from his master's property. He beheaded the animal with a hoe and cut the meat off the carcass. He then brought the spoils back to slave quarters to feed his fellow slaves.  But Master Tom, noticed Charles missing and shortly discovered his whereabouts that evening. Then the master commanded him to be tied to a mill-post for the night. After a day of contemplation, Charles' torture was decided. Tied to a post by his thumbs, he was whipped ninety six times. To exacerbate this immense agony, sweltering pepper tea was rubbed on the gashes in his back repeatedly, a feeling similar to hot coals being placed on one's body and thereby permanently disfiguring the skin. Helpless and completely immobilized, Charles experienced the incredulous cruelty and suffering of the slavery system.  His natural impulse to feed himself and his fellow slaves were punished in the most humanly disgraceful way.","With all the horror and terror that slaves experienced during this shameful period in our history, one wonders if slave owners ever felt pity for slaves or realized that they were of human flesh and not mindless beasts of burden.  Johnson writes in his book, <em>Soul by Soul,</em> “It was often the case that benevolent correctives and declarations of slave humanity intensified brutal exercise of power upon the captive body rather than ameliorating the chattel condition\" (5). This statement suggests that slaveholders abused their power by destroying the humanity of these poor human beings through torturous acts. Instead of improving their slaves’ already tenuous situation by treating them decently, owners exercised brutal power and used this power to excess.

He was unfortunate enough to be subjected to the harsh realities of chattel slavery through years of being rented out to various owners stretching from Missouri to Mississippi. A great deal of his time was spent aboard steamships, as a hand to take care of slaves or to wait on passengers. Wells recounts that after one particular summer aboard a steamship, he returned to the farm to find that his master had “got religion.” William had just left the employment of Captain Reynolds aboard the steamship Enterprize. What may have seemed like a ‘dream’ employment to slaves used to harsh labor conditions turned into a constant reminder for Brown that he was not free, as he was forced to watch white passengers pass from place to place as they pleased, while his brothers and sisters were chained below on their passage to the desolate slave pens of New Orleans.","William Wells Brown was somewhat relieved when he was able to return to life on the farm, despite the work in the “burning sun.” However, he was soon to be placed into the farmhouse as a waiter, where he found a that his master had become a man of devout worship. Brown made an important distinction when he talked of life before religion, and after. William wrote, “Formerly, we had the privilege of hunting, fishing, making splint brooms, baskets, &c.  on Sunday; but this was all stopped. Every Sunday, we were all compelled to attend meeting.... At night, the slaves were called in to attend [prayer]; but in the mornings, they had to be at their work...”","Bruce Levine, in his book “Half Slave and Half Free,” asserts that the distinctive labor systems of the North and the South, and particularly the reliance on slavery in the antebellum south, permeated into all aspects of regional life, including religion. Building from this assumption, the abrupt replacement of activities with religion points to the strength of the slave community, and the urgency of slave holders who were dependent on slave labor to undermine it.","William Wells Brown, when later speaking of his observations of a slave auction in St. Louis, recounted the pitch of an auctioneer to potential slave buyers. He writes, “Why should this man tell the purchasers that she has religion? I answer, because in Missouri, and as far as I have any knowledge of slavery in the other States, the religious teaching consists in teaching the slave that he must never strike a white man; that God made him for a slave; and that, when whipped, he must not find fault,--for the Bible says, \"He that knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes!\" And slaveholders find such religion very profitable to them.” Both the twisting of religious verse to justify the beatings of slave and the act of the beatings themselves both served and equal purpose: to keep the slave population in a place of servitude and to degrade any sense of autonomy the slaves might have had.

It was impossible for an African American to get his paintings into a gallery, no matter how good or famous he was. There was one group of painters, however, who came over this hurdle by selling their paintings straight to businesses- motels, offices and other such places. These men, the Florida Highwaymen, were a group of around seven men originally. Alfred Hair and James Gibson, two of these original Highwaymen, grew up together as friends, competing in everything. It was this competitive nature that led them to try and outdo one another in the arts, leading them to bringing in as much as $300 in one day in 1950s America (about $3000 today). Today, Mr. James Gibson has painted over 10,000 paintings and has served as the Ambassador of Art for Florida. He has four paintings hanging in the White House and has sold several of his works to former President George Bush, Sr. <br /> As influential as this group of artists was, however, they went forgotten for quite a long stretch of time. Having entered the art world during a time when Florida’s real estate and tourism business was booming, these artists found themselves presented with a large audience of prospective buyers. As this trend declined, however, many of the Highwaymen moved on to different areas of work, causing their influence to be entirely unremembered until 1995, when Jim Fitch, an arts acquisition agent, rediscovered this group of artists. One of the first books on the group listed as many as twenty-six African Americans under the Highwaymen, one woman among their ranks. <br /> Despite their success, the Highwaymen didn’t live completely without fear of competition. “There was envy from other men. One night it came to a head at a juke joint called Eddie’s Place,” Jacki Lyden said in an interview with two of the Highwaymen. Al Black, salesman for the Highwaymen and Alfred’s top businessman, recalls the story, he was at Eddie’s that night. The song “War” came on the jukebox, and Al Black and another unknown group began singing along to it. The next thing anyone saw was someone named J.L. shooting Alfred Hair in the chest. (Lyden) At the young age of 29, Alfred died, all but taking the Highwaymen business with him. Al Black found himself with no paintings to sell, and while he tried to paint his own, he became addicted to drugs and was accused of fraud, eventually being sentenced to twelve years in prison. Even in prison, Black would find space on penitentiary walls to paint Florida landscapes.

Mcdonough was granted permission to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor in the late nineteenth-century, but how was that possible given the horrendous circumstances that slaves endured? “His career began as the result of an argument between his master, slave-holder, and a planter. The dispute revolved about the question of the innate mental capacity of the Negro to improve him-self intellectually”. According to the <em>International Library of Negro Life and History, </em>his master chose to send Mcdonough off to school to prove his point that it was not possible for Negroes to obtain academic success. To his masters’ surprise, Mcdonough graduated from Lafayette College in Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Medicine and was the third in his graduating class. This beautiful success story embodies the truth behind the mental capacity of any Negro, and the light could shine.","Given the story above, Negroes in Medicine were still not permitted to practice and always faced harsh criticism. The greatest opposition to Negro Doctors was found in the South. This article by Paul B. Cornely in 1956 shows the stark reality of the matter. “In the South, however, only 6% of hospitals offered Blacks services without restrictions; 31% did not admit Blacks under any conditions, even emergency; 47% had segregated wards for Whites and Blacks; and 16% had modified patterns of segregation that changed with the ratio of Whites and Blacks admitted at any one time”. This example in the mid- twentieth century shows the disingenuous position than many White Southerners possessed in dealing with Negroes. However, that being said why is Booker T. Washington’s journal article <em>The Negro Doctor in the South</em>, show so much optimism? Booker T. Washington states that there are more than one-hundred Negro Doctors in the State of Alabama and there is over twenty-five in the Birmingham district. Of the many Negro Doctors, the State saw its first female African-American Doctor in Birmingham by the name of Dr. Sadie Dillard. Now let me ask you why has this proverbial light portrayed by Booker T. Washington shown itself in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1917 and we just saw a regressive mood in 1956? Booker T. Washington describes these fluctuations in trends as a few strong forces that have played a hand in elevating the Negro Doctor, despite the ever prevalent opposing forces. Case and point, Negro Physicians knew the road was not going to be easy, given that Hein site, Negro Doctors persevered and accounted for obstacles so the torch would continue to burn in their favor of progress, much like Dr. David K. Mcdonough did while he was oppressed and obtained the light."],"display_date":"September 25, 1790","search_date":"1790-09-25","locations":[{"id":15444,"lat":39.8405142472,"lng":-75.5864868268,"zoom":9,"place":"Chester, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":2191,"tag":"Doctors"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6074,"title":"Baseball: America's Greatest National Pastime","course_id":121,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-06-01","end_date":"1867-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As the Civil war drew to an end, it brought about the dawn of the game that would eventually be referred to as America’s “National Pastime.” According to the Baraboo Daily News, by 1867 baseball was pretty much organized and in full swing in the town of Baraboo, WI with much of the credit owed to the enthusiastic father of the game, George Dodd.","Baseball literally became the heart of little Baraboo, with its playing field in the very center of the town. Here, the people of Baraboo made memories and created history that is still shared today.  Like the day fans watched in awe as their very own Moore Hudson threw the very first fast pitch “like a bolt from the blue”.  Or the Baraboo boys most legendary and triumphant victory over their longtime Portage rivals.  Mr. Noyes pitched an excellent game that Fourth of July in 1976, and the colored catcher, who they called Johnson, with no protection and remarkable agility mastered the art of dodging the foul tips without letting his cigar leave it's spot between his lips.  It was an unforgettable day for Baraboo; it was an unforgettable game.","Every new-fangled pitch that developed with the passing years, from the fast ball to curve ball. Every time the incredible Le Grand Lippitt raced around the diamond in not much more than 13 seconds. Every time the crowd exploded as the crack of the legendary “Long Langdon’s” bat sent the ball soaring for a game winning homerun. This is what made the people of Baraboo fall in love with the game.  This is what made America fall in love with baseball.","The game changed over the years though.  Teams lost their “old-timers” from the roster and uniforms changed.  Although professional baseball started as a strictly white sport, African American’s started playing baseball in the mid 1800’s.  Players like Moses Fleetwood Walker and Bud Fowler finally made their way to inter-racial professional teams only to be rejected again by 1900; this eventually led to the founding of the Negro National League in 1920.  However, black players began creating their own teams and “barnstorming”, or challenging, any team willing to face them on the field. One of the most talented and well-known teams formed during this time was Robert P. Gilkerson’s very own Gilkerson Union Giants.  Though referred to as “those colored boys” and “the most comical aggregation ever assembled together”, the Giants swept across the country with an incredible series of victories.  During their 1921 season, the team came around that that home play a total of 916 times while their opposing teams scored just over 400 times.","Colored or not, America couldn’t ignore their astounding talent forever. On October 23, 1945 just 25 years after the Negro National League was formed and almost a century after American first discovered baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the first ever Major League Team to recruit a black player: Jackie Robinson.  And so this began the uniting of leagues and the blurring of racial lines until all that was seen was players on the field who loved the game of baseball.","So yes, baseball transformed since 1867.  The rules in the book, the measurements on the field, the pitch coming off the mound, and even the color of the players on the roster have changed. From the Baraboo boys’ in 1867, to the barnstorming of the Gilkerson Union Giants in 1923; from the history changing Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers to the renowned Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, it’s still the same game of baseball that makes America what it is today. And there is no doubt that baseball is still America’s greatest national pastime."],"display_date":"June 1867","search_date":"1867-06-15","locations":[{"id":15110,"lat":43.4268115625,"lng":-89.948369585,"zoom":9,"place":"SAUK, Wisconsin"}],"tags":[{"id":265,"tag":"america"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":233,"tag":"Baseball"}],"course":{"name":"Introduction to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":121,"school_id":68}},{"id":6286,"title":"The episode explores the relationship between Christianity and African-Americans.","course_id":133,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/06","end_date":"1/31/06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In January of 1906, the Financial Department of the National Christian Congress Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C., published an appeal to the public. Reverend H.J. Williams, the Association’s secretary, and Reverend R.B. Robinson, the Association’s president, are listed as the authors of the document. .  It is likely that the Association intended the publication to be read by educated, white readers, since the purpose of the announcement was to generate support for projects to aid African-Americans.","The Association made an appeal for monetary donations so that it could raise funds to create a publishing house to print “papers, pamphlets, books, and other literature” devoted to the betterment of African Americans and to bring whites and blacks closer together. The article explains that once the material was published, the Association wished to distribute the information to the Chautauqua Reading Circle. This organization was a popular reading group made up of intellectual white individuals.  The “Appeal” states that “Programs, essays, recitations, biographical and general readings” will be formulated with a message of harmony between whites and blacks.","The purpose of the Association’s article seems to be encouraging white readers to perform a moral evaluation of their thoughts regarding their relationship with African-Americans. It appeals to the conscience of Christians and asks them to establish “speedy amelioration” of problems affecting the African-Americans. When doing this, however, it does so in a derogatory tone stating that proper education should be directed towards African-Americans for their “advancement in dealing with the dominant race”. The overall message contained in the Appeal is commendable but one can see there is much for these Christians to think about.","The article is also directed towards the younger generation so that the Association can teach them to be more loving and respectful towards all people not just white people. They do this in the hope that life will be improved for African- Americans. The two authors of the article tell the readers that this is the only way to improve conditions between the races. They draw on the inherent kindness of individuals in hopes that they will donate to their noble cause to bring peace between the “dominant” white race and the African-American race.","Since even before the founding of the United States Christians had called for the betterment of African-Americans, most of whom were enslaved at the time. Thomas Paine was one such individual. In his essay <em>African Slavery in America </em>(which was later included in an anthology published in 1906 entitled The Writing of Thomas Paine), Paine speaks out about his concerns regarding slavery and belittles men who try to justify it through Christianity. He states,” Most shocking of all is alledging (sic) the Sacred Scriptures to favour (sic) this wicked practice.” He urges Christians to look toward the Gospel for guidance in matters pertaining to the enslavement of African-Americans.  He himself utilizes the Gospel beautifully when he reminds Christians to “ do to all men as they would be done”.","Slavery ended with the Civil War, but African-Americans still faced social and political inequalities in the United States. Inspired by Social Gospel some Christian groups saw their mission as improving conditions for blacks in the United States. Members of the American Home Mission Society “became passionate advocates of the rights of the freedmen.” The National Christian Congress Association’s appeal was published with the intent to improve society.  It utilized Christianity as a vehicle to bridge the separation between the whites and blacks in American society."],"display_date":"January 1906","search_date":"1906-01-16","locations":[{"id":52404,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District Of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":514,"tag":"Christianity"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}},{"id":6375,"title":"This Side Up, With Care: The Narrative of Henry Box Brown","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-03-23","end_date":"1849-03-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Henry Box Brown is notorious for escaping from slavery in the southern United States by shipping himself to freedom in the North in a wooden box. In <em>Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown</em>,<em> Written By Himself</em>, Brown described his experiences as a slave, and the events that triggered his bold plan to free himself. Brown was born into slavery in Virginia in 1815, and he described his life as not as physically brutal as that of other slaves. Regardless, Brown argued that slavery was cruel and damaging, particularly in consideration to how it separated him from his family. Brown and his wife were promised by their respective slaveholders that neither of them would be sold, so that they could remain together. Unfortunately, Brown’s wife and children were eventually sold to a slaveholder in North Carolina, and as a result Brown decided that he needed to escape slavery as the helplessness wrought by being enslaved became unbearable. ","Brown had the idea to ship himself in a wooden crate disguised as dry goods to territory in the North where slavery had been abolished. With the help of white abolitionist friends, Brown was successfully shipped from Virginia to Pennsylvania in a box that was three feet one inch long, two feet six inches wide, and two feet deep. Brown travelled in the box a distance of 350 miles in a period of 27 hours. He carried with him only a small portion of water stored in a bladder, for the purpose of hydration and wetting his face so that he would not faint. During the journey, the box was often thrown, tipped, and turned upside down, causing Brown pain and injury. The box was labelled “this side up with care,” but on a few occasions the box was tipped upside down, and Brown had to carefully balance himself so that he would not snap his neck. He risked being found and brought back into slavery or being physically hurt during his treacherous escape, but he successfully completed the trip without harm. When the box arrived in Philadelphia, Brown was greeted by several abolitionists, who celebrated his safe and successful journey. Brown’s testimony of his desperation to escape shows how even in the absence of physical brutality, slavery was a cruel, dehumanizing institution because of the mental and emotional impact it had on enslaved people.","The slave trade separated people from their loved ones and destroyed lives without any remorse, and as a result slaves like Brown reacted dramatically. In <em>Soul By Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market</em>, historian Walter Johnson introduces the chattel principle, a concept which states that “any slave’s identity might by disrupted as easily as a price could be set and a piece of paper passed from one hand to another” (19). This principle essentially describes how the life of a slave was never stable because the threat of sale always loomed over their heads. Johnson further describes how disruptive slavery was to the bonds that enslaved persons forged between each other, stating that most intelligent, self-aware slaves knew that every social relation, whether by blood, love, or friendship, was in no way secure because its dissolution by the slave trade was always imminent. In Brown’s narrative, he criticized this disruptive nature of the slave trade, stating that “the tyrant slaveholder regards not the social, or domestic feelings of the slaves… without giving the slightest consideration to the domestic or social ties by which the individuals are bound to each other,” because the slaveholders felt that the slaves’ feelings did not matter (17). Being separated from his family greatly pained Brown and caused him to grow weary of his bondage, which triggered his determination to escape from slavery hidden in a wooden shipping crate."," "],"display_date":"March 23, 1849","search_date":"1849-03-23","locations":[{"id":11224,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"},{"id":52765,"lat":37.9925909,"lng":-77.973865,"zoom":8,"place":"Louisa County, Virgina"}],"tags":[{"id":2729,"tag":"Runaway Slave"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6650,"title":"Hampton Institute: A Grand Opportunity for Freed African Americans","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"2/10/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Civil War era, freed African Americans from the North traveled South to Hampton Institute for the opportunity to mentor African Americans from the South who only had skills an average slave would have.

Fitzhugh, Esq. of Virginia, a vice president of the society, offered resolutions to expand funding options. With a task as large as removing and relocating freed blacks from the United States back to Africa, “private charity is inadequate to its full execution; that the resources of the nation and the state are required for it…” The society needed the backing of the federal government to realize its chief goal.","The society dated to 1816, and the ACS could claim many prominent members such as Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln. The ACS had one main goal; to relocate freed blacks back to Africa. As the population of enslaved Africans began to rise, the population of disenfranchised freed blacks rose as well. This growing assemblage of former slaves posed a significant stress on the predominantly white and racist society. Their main concern centered on the integration of the “inferior creatures” into society, as Samuel Hopkins, a member of the society, argued. Blacks living freely in the states, “could cause only injury to the slaves and disadvantage to the public” said Hopkins. Religious motives affirmed this massive project. Robert Finley,  a prominent figure in the society added, “The ACS was born out of religious benevolence and charity.” Claiming to be working in the name of God, freed Africans would liberate, “50 millions of people from the lowest state of ignorance and superstition, and restor[e] them to the knowledge and worship of the true God.” Using Christianity as a foundation, Elias Caldwell, another member, asserted that colonization was “a great national object and ought to be supported by the national purse.” Colonization seemed to be the only option at the time and in order for a project of this magnitude to be realized, the “national purse” needed to be opened. ","The ACS may have disapproved of slavery, but it remained blinkered by racist ideas. They justified the relocation of freed blacks as a benevolent action that solved the problem. This relocation supposedly benefited the, “American civil institutions, morals, and habits,” spread the word of God and redeemed the rest of Africa, Finley argued. Seemingly the only available option, the ACS gained supporters and momentum in antebellum South, with strong support from southern plantation owners who worried about the impact freed blacks would have on their slaves. As far as implementation, the cost of colonizing required incredible amounts of lives and money. Due to the magnitude of the project, private charity alone failed to cover the cost and thus the need for the appointment of a, “committee to draft memorials, to be immediately presented to the two houses of congress.”  Henry Clay’s campaign failed to produce grant money from the US government but the ACS received some state aid over the course of their existence. The ACS essentially disbanded after handing over their papers to the Library of Congress in 1919."],"display_date":"January 9, 1826","search_date":"1826-01-09","locations":[{"id":53200,"lat":38.880154466646,"lng":-76.949716179768,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington District of Columbia, U.S.A"}],"tags":[{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
