Land bought and sold by the Penobscot caught the eye of the State legislature.  The state saw a way to intervene in tribal affairs to govern the harvesting and selling of timber and land.  Many whites, opposed to this treatment of the Penobscot, felt that the State put \"guardianship\" over a sovereign and independent nation. By removing the Penobscots' freedoms this would ensure Maine's sovereignty, giving the state power to rule. The editor of the <em>Eastern Argus</em> argued for the same rights for Indians as for white citizens of Portland, Maine.","Andrew Jackson, depicted by some as a king in the early 1830s, pushed the Indian Removal Act down the throat of Congress, so whites could enjoy the land once hunted and farmed by Indian tribes.  Removal of Indians had strong opposition: the Democrats feared that this bill was supported by enemies of \"internal movements,\" and other factions such as Quakers and religious groups were outraged by a bill questioning the rights of Indians. Removal of Indians from native hunting grounds and sacred land was in Jacksons' best interest, then land could be divided to white settlers.  Once the bill passed, Jackson himself became the overseer of Indian removal, by giving him a chance to exercise his leadership skills and preparing him for things to come.  Indian removal became an insurmountable ordeal for Indian tribes of the 1830s."],"display_date":"August 20, 1830","search_date":"1830-08-20","locations":[{"id":5858,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"PENOBSCOTT, Maine"}],"tags":[{"id":90,"tag":"Indian Removal Act of 1830"},{"id":114,"tag":"Andrew Jackson"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"American Civilizations to 1877","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":20,"school_id":9}},{"id":4951,"title":"<strong>Indian Removal and the 1832 Election</strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-02-02","end_date":"1831-02-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["February 2<sup>nd</sup> 1831","Geneva Courier: “American Systems. For President, Henry Clay.”","There were two major contenders in the 1832 presidential election, the incumbent Andrew Jackson and the challenger Henry Clay. Jackson was quite popular, which was largely due to the fact that he was the first modern politician who had carefully crafted an image for himself. His popularity led to great power which, among other things, made him able to easily to convince Congress to pass his legislation with little opposition. One example of his power, which caused great debate, was the series of Indian removals in Georgia which he began to champion in his first term. Although the tribes which were removed, the Choctaw, Creek, Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Seminole,  were considered the “five civilized tribes,” because they owned and farmed their own land and even had some slaves, but they were still savages in the eyes of Jackson.","                Jackson’s deplorable treatment of the Indians would become a rallying cry for Henry Clay in his bid for the presidency. Despite the fact that in earlier writing Clay had stated that that he felt that Native Americans were a lower form of life who could never be assimilated with the American people, in the election campaign of 1832 he to defended their right to land and sovereignty. His National Democratic Party, which would be morphed into the Whig party by the next election, focused on moral issues like abolition and temperance, which were mostly championed by women’s groups at this time, included opposition to Indian Removal as a key issue.  Clay used the growing media to attempt to get his message to a wider audience. This can be seen in an article in the Pro-National Democratic Geneva Courier in its weekly segment “American System. For President, Henry Clay.” This part of the weekly paper was meant to spread the praises of Clay and denounce Jackson. In the February 2<sup>nd</sup> 1831 issue the paper gave an account of how Jackson sacrificed the “poor Indians,” and how such acts would bring great shame to the country. Despite the efforts of the paper and other anti-removal campaigns, the issue of Indian removal did not pull on the heart strings of as many voters as Clay had hoped. In 1832 the Seminole Indians, the last of the Indian groups to remain in Georgia were forced out, and the issue of Indian removal played little role in the election. Clay was crushed 219-49 in electoral college, as his opposition to Indian removal was unable to sway enough voters. Still, these accounts indicated that some white Americans had sympathy for the Indians plight."],"display_date":"February 2, 1831","search_date":"1831-02-02","locations":[{"id":8962,"lat":42.8528904967,"lng":-77.2997890257,"zoom":9,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":114,"tag":"Andrew Jackson"},{"id":260,"tag":"Cherokee Indians"},{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"},{"id":553,"tag":"1832 election"},{"id":554,"tag":"Henry Clay"},{"id":555,"tag":"Five Civilized Tribes"},{"id":556,"tag":"Creek Indians"},{"id":557,"tag":"American Indian Policy"},{"id":558,"tag":"Indian Removal"},{"id":559,"tag":"Land Policy"},{"id":560,"tag":"Manifest Destiny"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":6851,"title":"The Day the Wheel of Cheese Came to the White House","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-02-22","end_date":"1837-02-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 22, 1832, toward the end of Andrew Jackson’s presidency a large celebration in his honor took place. The festivities of music and a parade drew in a crowd of 10,000 people; but the highlight of the ceremony was the four-foot-tall, two-foot thick, fourteen-hundred-pound wheel of cheddar cheese, with a belt around it bearing the inscription: “Our Union, It Must be Preserved.” Ben Perley Poore witnessed the event, remembered it years later and described it in his book <em>Perley’s Reminiscences of Sixty Years in the National Metropolis. </em>Poore stated, “For hours did a crowd of men, women, and boys hack at the cheese, many taking large chunks away with them. When they commenced, the cheese weighed one thousand four hundred pounds, and only a small piece was saved for the President’s use. The air was redolent with cheese, the carpet was slippery with cheese, and nothing else was talked about at Washington that day.” The visitors ate most of the cheese within a few hours. Jackson gave a speech at the reception, staying seated due to his poor health. He left the event early, leaving Vice President Van Buren to continue to host the festivities. Van Buren, who succeeded Jackson as President, later remarked that he struggled to get the aroma of cheese out of the White House.","This was not the first time that a large wheel of cheese was given to a president and exhibited in the White House. In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson received a large twelve-hundred-pound wheel of cheese with a belt bearing the inscription “Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.” The gift, given by a Baptist minister to represent his support for Jefferson’s Presidency and defense of freedom of religion. There are obvious comparisons between the two cheeses. Both were given to the President and displayed at the White House to send a message.                                                                                                                               ","Ben Pearley Poore, a newspaper writer for <em>the Boston Journal</em> in Washington D.C., recounted the events years later, and gave his perspective of the message being sent by the gift of cheese to Jackson. In his opinion, the block of cheese being much larger than the one given to Jefferson and of the same quality, sent the message that President Jackson was an equal if not a better president than Jefferson. Jackson’s choice to make a major event inviting the public to partake of the cheese suggests that he wanted to retain the public support of the people, even at the end of his presidency. The use of the inscription: “Our Union, It Must be Preserved” is a reference to the fact southern states were threatening to secede from the Union. This was sending a message to the South on the issue of secession from the Union."],"display_date":"February 22, 1837","search_date":"1837-02-22","locations":[{"id":53181,"lat":38.799298867408,"lng":-77.310214268061,"zoom":8,"place":"White House"}],"tags":[{"id":114,"tag":"Andrew Jackson"},{"id":2769,"tag":"Presidency"},{"id":3075,"tag":"White House"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
