As seen in his after-action report, Confederates surprised the Fifth Division with their attack and Sherman's forces were driven far from their encampment. Though the army was in a panic, the retreat was ultimately halted and Sherman's men held their ground. The 32nd Indiana behaved as a model regiment for General Sherman.  Without haste, Sherman described them as advancing into a thicket where the \"enemy was in great numbers.\"  Despite the large numbers of the enemy the Indianans faced, they entered the battle ground \"in beautiful style.\" Though pushed back due to overwhelming numbers of Confederates, they earned the respect of General Sherman.","            Sherman's Fifth Division was driven to within five hundred yards of the Shiloh meeting house, but did not budge any further than that. He encouraged his men in the face of enemy fire and maneuvered his artillery and companies to engage pressing Confederates trying to capture his guns. Sherman showed his determination to hold off enemy attacks and at times exposed himself to enemy fire in order to direct the movements of his men. He had a total of three horses shot out from under him.           ","            Prior to the Battle of Shiloh, on April 6, 1862, General Sherman, due to General Grant's false evaluation of enemy movement, was not expecting to come into contact with Confederate forces. The 5th Ohio cavalry and the 46th Ohio Infantry Regiment reported seeing Confederate movement but this was ignored by General Sherman. Sherman became enraged with Colonel Thomas Worthington of the 46th Ohio Regiment due to his constant warnings.  Worthington was court-martialed by Sherman and the colonel was a permanent enemy of Sherman from that point on. General Sherman would find out that Worthington was right when early on April 6th Confederates came crashing through the woods into Union positions."," Despite his temper and ignorance on April 5, General Sherman proved important to the Union army. He is credited with saving the Northern forces at the Battle of Shiloh. Abraham Lincoln stated that, \"It is the unanimous opinion here that Brig. Genl. W.T. Sherman saved the fortunes of the day on the 6th and contributed largely to the glorious victory on the 7th.\""],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":101,"tag":"32nd Indiana Regiment"},{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4719,"title":"<strong>Turning the Tide: Col.

Often, however, those involved in these critical moments do not realize their own significance. On April 9, 1862, Colonel Samuel Beatty, of the Nineteenth Ohio Infantry submitted a report which detailed the actions of his regiment during the Battle of Shiloh two days earlier. Beatty’s regiment of volunteers had crossed the Tennessee River at midnight the previous night, after the surprise Confederate attack on 6 April had nearly overwhelmed Grant’s force at Pittsburg Landing. Beatty’s regiment was a part of Major General Buell’s force, which provided major reinforcements for General Grant’s dilapidated army and helped turn the tide of battle during the second day into a clear Union victory.","Col. Beatty was straightforward in his report, but was also anxious to emphasize that he and his men took an active role in the battle itself. After being organized and then re-organized by different commanding officers, Beatty sent two different sets of skirmishers out to engage Confederate forces, capture prisoners, and gain knowledge of the enemy position. Eventually, the entire regiment advanced along with a larger Union force that “remained at the brow of the hill under an artillery fire,” and finally ended up advancing “under fire of musketry, by which several were wounded, and delivered well-directed volleys with apparent effect, and then fell back halfway up the hill.”  As the confederate forces fell back on 7 April, Beatty’s force was not ordered to advance any further, and remained encamped on the battlefield for the next few days.","This report outlines what is perhaps the most critical moment at Shiloh: the Union Army’s utilization of the night to regroup, reorganize, and ultimately reverse the fate of the battle. Buell’s army helped Grant and Sherman’s forces recover from the massive death toll of the first day of fighting. It was this turn of events that seriously affected subsequent events on the western theatre and memories of war. Sherman became convinced that only “total war,” focusing on economic interests as well as armies, could effectively defeat the Confederacy. Also, Grant was able to prove his worth as a general by standing firm in his last lines of defense (thus securing permanent control over Western Tennessee) before fresh troops from Buell arrived in the night. Finally, the widespread carnage at Shiloh forced a restructuring of historical memory; artists’ depictions gradually became more realistic, the death of one single person lost some of its significance in the face of the 24,000 lost within the two days of battle. Thankfully, Beatty’s report shows that in spite of the carnage he was still keenly aware of the loss of every one of his men, some 4 dead, 44 wounded, and 8 missing.","Samuel Beatty had raised his regiment of volunteers from his home in Stark County, Ohio. After serving as his regiment’s elected Colonel at Shiloh, he was promoted to brigadier general and took part in several major battles in the western theatre of the Civil War. At the time when Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Beatty was being considered for promotion to major general. After the end of the war, he returned home to his farm in Ohio and lived peacefully for the rest of his life."," "],"display_date":"April 9, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-09","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4720,"title":"<strong>Confederate Disorganization Leads to Chaos at Shiloh</strong>","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-06","end_date":"1862-04-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the battle of Shiloh, Colonel Issac L. Dunlop discovered that even the clearest laid plans and troop organization can be turned into complete chaos after the start of battle.  According to the Official Reports of the battle, Colonel Isaac L. Dunlop and his Ninth Arkansas Infantry are clearly put under the command of Brigadier General J.C. Breckinridge in the Reserve Corps, to the east of the battlefield. However, Col. Dunlop’s regiment somehow managed to get in the dead center of the battle within the first day on 6 April, 1862. General A.S. Johnston found them and ordered them into battle, specifically to charge up a hill and force the Union soldiers to give up their position. Dunlop stated that he learned afterward that the men they faced were Pickett’s, but whether or not his regiment was partially responsible for the taking of the famed “Hornet’s Nest,” no one knows. They continued pursuing the Union soldiers until their position became one of “extreme peril” that was right in between “two batteries, both pouring grape and canister into [the] ranks” and then fell back to a safe position for the night.","Further organizational confusion was apparent the following morning, 7 April, when Dunlop and his men were pulled from battle in the face of a Union advance and ordered to support General J. K. Jackson and make a stand.  However, the brigade fell before Dunlop could get into position, and chaos began to rule the day; Dunlop’s regiment advanced too far forward and became completely detached from General Jackson’s Brigade, becoming “exposed to a destructive fire from both flanks.”  Rather than rejoining Jackson, Dunlop chose instead to continue moving his men in the same direction and joined up with a different brigade, this one commanded by Col. John D. Martin.  In spite of numerous attempts to make a stand and hold their position, ultimately the order to fall back was given.","Dunlop, in typical Confederate fashion, made little mention of the defeat. Instead, he emphasized in his report the bravery of his regiment, their perseverance in battle, and their tireless dedication to confronting the enemy. He gave little indication that the battle was going against them when the order came to fall back at 3 pm on 7 April, and then returned to commending the bravery of the fallen and giving numerical information to his commanding officer, J. S. Bowen.","Victor Davis Hanson, in Ripples of Battle, describes the Confederate force at Shiloh as a “microcosm of the Confederacy” that was rife with disorganization, confusion, and disunion. Other authors, such as  Brooks Simpson and Ned Bradford, definitely agree with the portrayal of confusion and chaos, though they diverge on other subjects. General A.S. Johnston provided clear and charismatic leadership, but Col. Dunlop’s report clearly indicates that without such a strong leader the Confederate forces barely managed a semi-organized retreat. With the loss at Shiloh, as well as the loss of Johnston, the western theatre had little hope of Confederate success for the remaining three years."],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 14, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-10","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4735,"title":"Col.

Moore included this in the beginning of his report on the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Tired, hungry, and lacking supplies, the Second Texas Infantry left Texas, met with the rest of the Army of Mississippi and then traveled to Tennessee for the Battle of Shiloh within a three month time period. The Second Texas Infantry was a rather new infantry. It had only been together for less than six months when it joined the Army of Mississippi and fought against the Union troops.","Despite the hardships that they faced, the Second Texas Infantry “moved forward with light hearts and buoyant spirits without a murmur of complaint” toward the Battle of Shiloh. Imagine not only entering the war tired and hungry, but with a lack of proper clothing. Although Moore stated in his report that all of his men refrained from complaining, in reality this is not plausible, but it does illustrate the leaders tendency to paint their men in the best light possible.  As Moore stated in his report, many of the men, officers included, returned from the war barefoot because the lack of viable shoes available. Author Tony Horwitz visited the battlefield where the Battle of Shiloh occurred and wrote about what the soldiers must have experienced that day: cold, soaking wet feet. He mentioned the coldness while wearing shoes. The soldiers were barefoot on the cold, wet ground and running and fighting, not simply walking.","In addition to these hardships, the soldiers also faced the confusion of men who were inexperienced in battle. At one point when the Second Texas Regiment was fighting the Union forces, a Federal Colonel approached them shouting “Boys, for God’s sake stop firing, you are killing your friends.” Colonel Moore stated that this Colonel was simply deceiving his men, but it still indicates the uncertainty of the fighting. Moore did not lead his men on the second day of battle, but sent in a report on his regiment in defense of their actions. In his second report on the Battle of Shiloh, he acknowledged that his men contributed to the Confederate’s loss, but he defended them by placing the blame on the “multiplicity of commands, and the consequent confusion of the men not knowing whom to obey”, illustrating both a leader’s determination to paint his men in a good light and the confusion of the battle that the inexperienced men had to endure.","Although the Confederates lost the Battle of Shiloh, The Second Texas Infantry unit was commended for its bravery by generals P.G.T. Beauregard and Dabney Maury.  Following the first day of Battle, John Moore was promoted from Colonel to Brigadier General in charge of the Second Brigade."," "],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4740,"title":"Adolph Engelmann's report of the Battle of Shiloh","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-06","end_date":"1862-04-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Adolph Engelmann's report on the battle of Shiloh, he discusses the different obstacles and hardships that the forty third regiment had to endure during this \"bloody battle\". Within his regiment, a report stated that seventy five enlisted were either killed or mortally wounded while one hundred and sixty one of the soldiers died either of disease or accident. Although significant, these statistics often results in one forgetting the experiences or conditions that lead to these deaths. Casualties during the war were usually the accumulation of several issues, including many that could have been prevented with better organization and with modern medicine practices and technology. Also, the soldiers were exposed to uncontrollable factors, such as illness, that made combat more complex. For instance, on the morning of April 6, Engelmann was sent by the general to report to Colonel Earden that he should his get brigade ready for battle. However, Colonel Earden was ill and unable to go to battle. As a result, he ordered that Colonel Raith, being the next in command, be responsible for this brigade. This shows how the subjection of the army to the whims of diseases and illnesses can often result in disorganization among the regiments, ultimately affecting them in battle.","The lack of both developed practices of medicine as well as an abundant amount of supplies often held up the progress of individual regiments as well. During the battle of Shiloh, Lieutenant Colonel Engelmann states how Colonel Raith is shot with a minie ball through his thigh. Through the day and \"stormy night\", Engelmann reports that the colonel was laid out and exposed but refuses the very little assistance that is offered to him. Eventually, his leg is amputated, and he dies from \"exposure and loss of blood\".  In more modern times, this wound to the leg would probably have been easily taken care of. Because of limited medical knowledge, General Raith’s death was added to the number of causalities in Shiloh. But, these were not the only conditions that would affect the soldiers. Lack of supplies also tended to create problems within regiments. When the forty third regiment's ammunition supply ran low, there was no time to attain more ammunition before they were supposed to advance towards the enemy.  As a result, Lieutenant Colonel Engelmann states that his fellow soldiers had to ransack the dead bodies of the rebel army in order to have somewhat adequate ammunition to fight the battle with.","All of these examples reveal how the everyday experiences of soldiers in these small combative units were burdened with factors and conditions that created even more hardships in battle. Although most soldiers did their best to rally together, many felt \"totally worn out and exhausted\" as a result."," "],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12369,"lat":35.182488505,"lng":-89.8964012565,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}}]}
