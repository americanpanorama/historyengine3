The resulting conflict went on for three days, ending in 43 dead and 1,189 injured. This had a large impact on Detroit. James E. Cummings, a successful Detroit business man who was very active in the human rights efforts such as the National Associatoin for the Advancement of Colored People and the Detroit Urban League, experienced the riots firsthand. According to Cummings, after the Riot of 1967, property owners in Black Bottom were desperate to sell their land before the prices plummeted again due to another race riot outbreak.","This alludes to the instability of Detroit in the years surrounding the riot. This played a key role in the “white flight” that occurred shortly afterwards, in which middle-class whites began moving out of the east side of Detroit, which was predominantly black as a result of discriminatory housing practices. Black Bottom, where the bulk of the violence took place, was one of the principle neighborhoods in which blacks could live and there was a high concentration of poverty in it. In this time, there was a wide effort by city officials in trying to “contain” the black population to only certain parts of the city. The Riot of 1967 brough national attention to the racial tensions and institutionalized racism in Detroit while simultaneously alarming city residents."],"display_date":"July 23, 1967 - July 26, 1967","search_date":"1967-07-24","locations":[{"id":33546,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1961,"tag":"1967 Race Riot"},{"id":1914,"tag":"Black Bottom"},{"id":1913,"tag":"White Flight"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6027,"title":"The Racism in Fences","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/95","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["There is a startling contrast between the city of Detroit and its neighboring suburb of Grosse Pointe. You start in Detroit being surrounded by poverty and then suddenly, as you drive north to Grosse Pointe, you have the opposite side of the spectrum. It is extremely well-off, with mansions and perfectly manicured lawns. You go from one extreme to the other in a matter of minutes. While some blame the 1967 race riot and others believe that a complex set of circumstances led to it, but it is no doubt that White Flight was a real thing with anyone with money moving out to the suburbs. The ones with the most money moved out first and to Grosse Pointe. That loss in tax revenue left the burden up to those who could already not afford it, exacerbating the problem. It is very obvious what things are in Detroit that are meant for Detroiters and what is meant for Grosse Pointers, that many believe is a clear showing of racism. An example of this is the Detroit Yacht Club. Aside from the fact that the allowance of memberships to African Americans came only recently in their history, but a large fence encompasses the place, making it quite clear that only some people are wanted.","The physical boundary of a fence is quite political in its own right. It is a sign to everyone that there is an us and a them, that some belong while others are left to look in from the outside. It takes a psychological toll, to see someplace that you are not welcome in. Aside from physically keeping people out, a looming fence drills into them that they are inferior and not good enough to join."],"display_date":"1970 - 1995","search_date":"1982-12-31","locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1913,"tag":"White Flight"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
