a letter to his brother-in-law, Daniel Bryan, on December 7, 1830, James Barbour discussed his life and retirement from politics. Barbour had been a member of the House of Delegates in Virginia from 1793 to 1804 and again from 1808 to 1812, the governor of Virginia from 1812 to 1815, a Virginia senator from 1815 to 1825, and the U.S. Secretary of War from 1825 to 1828. Writing to Bryan, Barbour talked about political life absorbing his every moment, and wrote I am sick of politics. At this time, Barbour was going through a contested election to the House of Delegates in Virginia, which no doubt was a source of much of his frustration with politics. Barbour had served the state and his nation well, and as he said, political life had so absorbed my time that he had been able to think scarcely of anything else. He complained that politics had changed, and that violence was the only way now to gain popularity (amongst the voters). Finally, Barbour thanked Bryan for his support, and states his desire to hear more from Bryan as his political career has ended."," Barbour wrote this letter from Richmond - the city where a great deal of his political life was spent, from the House of Delegates to the Governor of Virginia. Richmond was the capital of Virginia, a political center for the South, as it would later become the capital of the Confederacy. Thus, in this city Barbour was surrounded by political life (which had had been a central figure in. The harshness of this life shows from his attitude of a tired politician. The political parties of America had reorganized in the mid-1820s during John Adams' presidency, and at the end of this Barbour was a National Republican (opposing the Democrats). With this allegiance, he opposed the man occupying the presidency after Adams, Andrew Jackson. When Jackson was elected president in 1828, after a long and passionate campaign, the National Republican party came to a stand-still for the a short period, and it was during this period that Barbour decided he had taken enough of the political world. It seems that the campaign for president in 1828 (and the overall struggle for power among parties) had been too rough on Barbour. He, as many other Republicans, was disheartened by the election of Jackson. Instead of continuing the struggle against the Democrats, Barbour chose to retire from public life."],"display_date":"December 7, 1830","search_date":"1830-12-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1952,"title":"Birth Control Practices in Missouri and the Abortion Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1835-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["By the early half of the nineteenth century, Victorian views of sexuality in the South dictated that women and men remain virginal until marriage. Others held the view that sex after marriage had procreative purpose only. However, many so-called free thinkers such as Charles Knowlton, Abner Kneeland, and Samuel Thompson recognized that Victorian ideals clashed with the reality of everyday life. Many unmarried women who found themselves pregnant used abortion as commonplace birth control practice. ","Abortion practices were not always safe. Local doctors replaced local midwives who had previously performed abortion procedures. However, little actual gynecological medical training or practice complicated the procedure. Many in new medical professional groups pushed for greater autonomy and influence of highly trained medical practitioners to replace the backward practices of quacks who advocated abortion. In Missouri and throughout the South, this growing influence created a greater movement towards white professional doctors. The effect led to the passage of the 1835 St. Louis, Missouri abortion statute, a full twenty years before many states passed similar laws. However, this law hardly stopped sex among unmarried couples or hindered adulterous relationships. Women and men circumvented the law by turning to the work of the free-thinkers, who published and distributed pamphlets on sexual and reproductive health and contraceptive methods. In the South alone, liberal literature included topics about contraceptive methods and sexual advice. This literature circulated to more than 200 agents by 1836, many of whom operated near St. Louis and along the Mississippi river. One popular example included Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy, which made it to third edition within three years of its original publication in 1830. Popular mail-order items in Missouri-among other states nationwide-included condoms, feminine cleansing products, and abortifacients. Though free-thought groups flourished nationwide, they often kept semi-private for fear of being thought liberal and infidel in their causes. More readily available and cheaper contraceptive devices for men-a dozen condoms sold for three dollars in 1850-allowed couples to engage in sexual relationships, although secret, with fewer consequences.","Many kept their sexual freedoms covert in Missouri and the South not only because of the abortion law, but also because of the issue of interracial sexual relationships. As Nathan Stormer notes, reproductive control for early opponents represented a cacophonous...threatening assault on the status quo of gender, family and class relations. Many feared that if fear of pregnancy were removed from sexual intercourse, wives' sexual faithfulness could not be assured, legitimate children might not so easily be distinguished from illegitimate children, and bloodlines and inheritance might, in consequence, be jeopardized. Because inheritance often dictated property rights in the South, the case of illegitimate-and perhaps mulatto-children produced from an adulterous relationship made easier with birth control brought this issue to the regional and national forefront."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1953,"title":"Catholicism&#39;s Impact on Religion and Politics in St. Louis\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-12-17","end_date":"1835-12-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["While American historians often focus on the millions of immigrants that moved through Ellis Island, many of these same people traveled west and ended up in St. Louis. The city became a locus of immigrant activity, both religious and cultural. However, negative changes often accompanied positive ones with the large influx of immigrants. The greater influence of Catholicism, the dominant immigrant religion, affected the already strained religious and political tensions between the South's religious mixes: Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians. As the St. Louis Observer stated, although southerners recognized the Founding Fathers' guarantees to every individual in our land, the free exercise of his religion, political Nativists feared that the Papacy as both a religious and political power would interfere with American government."," In their letter to the Observer, a Nativist wrote that Catholicism was not just a religion but a political organization that recruited members to draw funds from the American people to aid them in universalizing. In this manner, many whites in St. Louis and throughout the South felt Catholicism endangered the white Southern religious sects. Nativists felt that Catholicism in the form of millions of immigrants was a forewarning of an American St. Bartholomew's Day-the foreign seed will, like dragon's teeth which Cadmus sowed in a field, produce an assembly of armed men. Xenophobia of Catholic immigrants was not limited to the South, however. In places such as New York and Chicago where large immigrant groups flocked, whites felt the need to push for control over those alien to their existing and dominant role in the social order. Whites faced a population of black Africans and few laws in place for immigrant migration regulation. Although whites as a collective group still held control of government and other public institutes nationwide, immigrants placed an increasing social and economic demand on the United States. Poor Catholic immigrant groups spoke many different languages and educated themselves in parochial schools rather than American public schools. American Nativists feared Catholics not just because of their religious affiliation but also for their ability (unlike black Africans) to largely and successfully exist outside of the dominant white southern culture."],"display_date":"December 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-17","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1956,"title":"The Honey War Boundary Dispute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-12-02","end_date":"1839-12-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Colonel John C. Sullivan established the borders of pre-statehood Missouri and marked what he thought would be the northern boundary of Missouri. Unfortunately, Sullivan made a major error in his plans, which caused a discrepancy in the boundary line. This mistake made one part of the border more than four miles larger than the other. By 1833 when many people had settled in the area and were applying for Iowa statehood, this unnoticed error came to the forefront as the boundary line came into question. Missouri officials sent surveyor Joseph Brown to re-survey the Sullivan line in 1837. However, the vague description of the line's supposed origin outlined in the Missouri Constitution at the rapids of the river Des Moines, created another problem. The difference between the two survey lines was more than 2,500 acres and created a vast expanse of land that officials from both Missouri and Iowa claimed state ownership. By 1839 however, the conflict increased when Missouri sheriffs attempted tax collection in the disputed strip of land. Iowa governor Robert Lucas warned Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs that the Missouri sheriffs would not be permitted to do this, but Boggs threatened militia action to ensure the taxes were collected. Missouri once again attempted to collect taxes in December of 1839, but Iowa officials arrested the Missouri sheriff. Both Missouri and Iowa called on their local militias to gather at the disputed strip of land. In the process, soldiers destroyed several profit-turning honey trees causing further upheaval between the states. A poem published by satirist John L. Campell entitled The Honey War mirrored the popular criticism of the two governors, giving the dispute its unofficial name.","With militias poised to fire, Clark County, Missouri formed a committee to deal with the issue. On December 24, 1839, peace talks led to the adoption of resolutions...requesting the two governors to submit the boundary question to Congress and suspend military operations. Governors Boggs and Lucas remained on poor terms while the line dispute remained unsettled. The Supreme Court finally settled the dispute in 1851, which established the Sullivan line as the official northern boundary of the state of Missouri. While the boundary dispute between Missouri and Iowa resolved itself fairly quickly, other southern land disputes at the time did not. United States governmental interactions with indigenous Native American populations led to conflict over land rights, especially when they removed Cherokees from their land in Georgia in the late 1830s. Later known as the Trail of Tears, U.S. government officials claimed tribal lands to accommodate whites who journeyed into the South to claim gold rumored hidden within the Georgia hills. The United States moved Native Americans to reservations throughout the mid-nineteenth century as a commonplace practice. Native Americans had limited negotiation power with the United States and reduced their autonomy to little consequence when they tried to settle land and boundary disputes."],"display_date":"December 2, 1839 - December 24, 1839","search_date":"1839-12-13","locations":[{"id":8031,"lat":38.288627243,"lng":-94.3452200361,"zoom":9,"place":"VAN BUREN, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1959,"title":"Remembering the Brave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-08-25","end_date":"1890-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" There must always be homage paid to those who lost their lives in battle.Even in defeat, the Confederate States honored their unknown fallen.OnAugust 25, 1890, The State newspaper out of Richmond reported that work was being continued on the monument to memorialize these brave men.Workers at the site said that the progress was moving along at a good pace to complete the monument.The stone in which the monument was to be carved was applauded to be the one of the most beautiful stones ever brought to Richmond.The site was shielded to prevent people from seeing it before its completion and unveiling.

The article informed the people of Easton that there is a gang of villains now in our borough, who are endeavoring to further a scheme of the most diabolical swindling, by putting into circulation Counterfeit Notes of 50 and 20 on the Union Bank of Maryland. ","Counterfeiters significantly threatened the efficient development of the American economy. For the merchants of Easton, failure to recognize counterfeit notes resulted in substantial financial losses. In terms of their customers, it meant the loss of one's reputation as a trustworthy vendor. Attempts made by Congress to create a sound currency clashed with the cherished belief held by many Americans that the federal government should have a limited role in the nation. According to historian David R. Johnson, the federal government reserved the right to coin money but neither institution that Congress created, the US Mint and the Bank of the United States, exerted much control over national development. "," Counterfeiters gained a tremendous advantage with the development and proliferation of state banks such as the Union Bank of Maryland. Due to the Mint's failure to produce enough coin for the rapidly expanding economy, Johnson claims that state banks began to compete with the Mint as a monetary source by issuing their own currency. State governments chartered privately owned banks, and granted them the right to issue currency backed by each bank's capital reserves. State Banks claimed that their bank notes did not violate the federal government's currency policy since the states neither directly issued these banks notes nor supported them with their credit. Counterfeiting became far easier with the increase of paper money in circulation. <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> newspaper article stated, we look to our police, on this occasion, for such vigilance as may bring the whole of these wretches to justice. Counterfeiting threatened efficient development of the American economy, and failure to recognize counterfeit notes often resulted in significant financial losses. "," For southerners, the bank brought out their fears of an oppressive central authority, and the necessity for local control to protect liberty. Senator Nathaniel Macon in 1818 expressed the anxieties of southerners; I must ask you to examine the constitution of the U.S. ... and then tell me whether if Congress can establish banks, make roads and canals, whether they can free all the Slaves in the U.S. The rising numbers of counterfeiter bank notes in circulation became an increasingly greater problem associated with the banking system. The development of the American banking system created tensions between the North and South. According to historian William J. Cooper, opponents of banks in the South charged that the power of banks gave an unnatural privilege that imperiled both the independence of the community and the control individuals had over their own affairs."],"display_date":"March 25, 1817 - March 26, 1817","search_date":"1817-03-25","locations":[{"id":6065,"lat":38.702724259,"lng":-76.2699764629,"zoom":9,"place":"TALBOT, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1964,"title":"A Clash of Views over Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-08-12","end_date":"1829-08-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> of Easton, Maryland published an article on August 12, 1829 regarding Indian removal. The Easton article responded to the essay written by William Penn published in <em>The National Intelligencer of Washington </em>on July 17, 1829. Penn's essay discussed the need to exterminate the Indians in order to allow for expansion into the West. The article in the Easton newspaper stated that while there seems to be such a prevalent disposition south and west of us to exterminate the aborigines of this land, we feel it our duty to raise our voice and use every exertion to stay that band of power from sweeping them from the face of the earth. The article published in <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> asserted that we stand for the bitter detestation and abhorrence of tyranny and oppression of the aborigines of this land. Additionally, in response to William Penn's essay promoting Indian extermination, the article in the Easton newspaper paper claimed that we occasionally meet with traits of Indian character so humane and generous as to produce in the civilized mind mingled emotions of astonishment and delight. "," <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> article exemplified the tensions between anti-expansionist Americans, and those who supported expansion into the West and Indian removal. Southerners generally supported expansion and Indian removal while northerners tended to disapprove of such action. A significant turning point occurred in 1828 with the election of Andrew Jackson to power as president. Jackson, a prominent figure in the South, led the campaign for Indian removal. Jackson often publicly stated that in order to rescue Indians from the destructive vices of civilization, Indians must be removed and placed farther into the West. Historian William Brandon claims that northerners tended to disagree with this statement. Northerners believed that Jackson's genuine motive for Indian removal resulted from his desire to allow southerners to secure themselves land in the territory that opened up in the West. "," According to Brandon, southerners felt threatened by nationalism. Southerners found refuge in an aggressive assertion of both states rights and sectional economic interests. With the support of Jackson, southerners believed they needed to fulfill their 'destiny' to own and farm the land possessed by Indians all the way from Georgia to the Mississippi River. Thus, southerners found it particularly displeasing that northerners tried to prevent them from fulfilling this 'destiny. The issue of Indian removal significantly added to the tensions between the North and the South as southern anxieties continued to mount that the North threatened their rights to liberty."],"display_date":"August 12, 1829 - August 13, 1829","search_date":"1829-08-12","locations":[{"id":6066,"lat":38.702724259,"lng":-76.2699764629,"zoom":9,"place":"TALBOT, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1967,"title":"Bank Notes: The Second Bank of the United States\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-03-07","end_date":"1823-03-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Booth Taliaferro, a resident of Norfolk, Virginia sent a letter on March 7, 1823 to Mr. Richards, the manager of finances of the George Washington Estate of Westmoreland County, Virginia. In the letter, Taliaferro informed Richards that he received the manager's previous letter enclosed with a check. In Richards's previous letter, he made the check to Taliaferro for 840 dollars. According to Taliaferro, Richards's letter contained a request to have the notes converted into funds current with Taliaferro's banks. In order to make use of the check that Taliaferro received from the George Washington Estate, he needed to convert the money into funds current with banks in Norfolk. This required Taliaferro to visit to his local state chartered bank. State banks acted as commercial enterprises; profit-seeking privately owned institutions that created cash deposits payable in legal tender on demand. According to historian Robert Buckley Tanner, state banks financial success depended on their ability to keep their own notes in circulation, or else they had to rely solely on the assets of their stockholders and depositors. Thus, state banks fought to keep their competitors notes out of circulation. Neither Taliaferro nor Richards wrote of any doubts they had in their local banks ability to convert notes. However, Tanner claims southerners as a whole tended to assert that the power of banks gave an unnatural privilege to the government. Southerners believed this unnatural privilege imperiled both the independence of the community and the control they had over their own affairs. "," In 1823, the year of correspondence between Taliaferro and Richards, Americans experienced a change in the national banking system; Nicholas Biddle became head of the Second Bank of the United States (BUS). Biddle convinced his board of directors to allow him to authorize the issuance of five and ten dollar drafts. Historian Robert V. Remini claims BUS prepared the drafts in Philadelphia in blank, and then distributed them to the branches of BUS. The branches endorsed the drafts 'payable to bearer' and issued them according to their needs. The drafts easily passed as money, because they looked like bank notes in design, color and texture. Biddle presented the paper of state banks for redemption in specie at the same time BUS issued the drafts. According to Remini, this allowed Biddle to drive the depreciated currencies out of circulation, and provide the country with a relatively safe and uniform currency. Conflicts over the banking system led to tensions between the North and South. Congress built the main office of BUS in Philadelphia, and southerners had no difficulty branding BUS a northern institution that benefited mainly northern financial interests. To southerners, the bank brought out their fears of an oppressive central authority, and the necessity for local control to protect liberty.

The newspaper recognized the great threat that these party dissidents posed to the security of the Party, writing that though the group is a minority, they still have the power to cause the majority to yield to its dictation.

However, in the election of the following year, the Democratic Party (as predicted by the article) yielded to the free silver Democrats under William Jennings Bryan, but fell to the Republican's solid gold standard in part due to the confusion that the Party's platform created in attempting to cater to hard-line Democrats, free-silver Democrats, and even Populists. This confusion and split in the Party affected even the 1894 Congressional election, where Democratic Party fell to the Republicans' 150,000 vote majority. As the split between the Democratic Party widened and the Populist Party remained a threat, the strife between the sections only worsened and the Republican victory in 1896 was virtually assured.","Date: January 16, 1895","Location: Berryville, Clarke County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Economy, Government, Law, Politics","Episode Scope: Local, Regional, National","Clarke Courier, January 16, 1895.

The Montgomery Messenger, of Montgomery County, Virginia recognized this fact and in an article written on Friday, August 23, 1895, the writer discussed the benefits of a good roads convention. The convention was meant to be statewide and one delegate from each county was expected to attend; thus the event was of statewide significant importance, most especially to farmers and industrialists who wanted to get their materials across the state more efficiently. Furthermore, everyone interested in improving the state's roads was invited. The article goes on to explain that the State Good Roads Association had been very active in improving the infrastructure of the state, and that citizens of the state have every reason to feel satisfied and encouraged with the results of the association's work. The paper estimated (though the accuracy of this statement cannot truly be determined) that some 90% of the population believes in the importance of good roads. The article also went so far as to say that the remaining 10% would agree, if they simply thought about it for a moment. In addition, they estimated that the number of workers employed to improve the roads increased tenfold from the previous year."," Though these numbers seem rather outrageous and are likely to be incorrect and under-researched, the article is still testament to the importance of infrastructure improvement in the South. The burgeoning iron, steel, mining, and timber industries of the South called for better roads for transportations, to accommodate the moving of goods and the travel of northern prospectors and investors. Better roads needed to be built to transport raw materials to the newly built industrial centers located now in the South, unlike prior to the industrialization of the South where materials were either shipped overseas or sent north. Improving the infrastructure of the South (through roads and railroads) was crucial to the development of the quickly growing Southern economy and its important industries.","Date: August 23, 1895","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Politics, Government, Economy, Migration/Transportation, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, August 23, 1895.

It was created in order to protect the farmers who were affected by particularly poor economic times in the late nineteenth century by helping push up the prices of their goods. Just prior to its fall, the Farmer's Alliance was viewed by some members of the Democratic Party as nothing more than somewhat of a nuisance. A small newspaper with strong Democratic leanings stationed in Lexington, Virginia, The Rockbridge County News described the great Alliance movement as, played out. They claimed that the Alliance failed because they lost sight of the reforms that were once the pillars of the movement. According to the article, they had lost sight of their goals of protecting themselves from monopoly and the encroachments of organized capital."," The paper also claimed that the movement had spread itself too thin and had broadened the topics of their grievances to encompass economics, social orders, political processes, and financial issues. This, according to the article was brought about by the new leaders of the movement, who were too liberal and too ambitious in their reforms. If only they had [made] their demands through the old political parties of the country If they had merely stayed small and specific, they may have experienced more success."," One can easily identify the outright bias the writer of this article has for the Democratic Party, and the hostility he likely feels toward the Farmer's Alliance. The Democrats of the age appeared to have cooperated with the Alliance when it emerged, but were clearly more interested in securing their southern votes than actually identifying with their grievances. Though Democrats such as the writer of this article may have disillusioned themselves into believing that the Alliance movement was not a threat, the Democrats' apathy toward the Alliances cause coupled with the Democrats' outright electoral corruption (the ballot-stuffing, the bribery, the assaults) forced the emergence of the Populist party, which occurred with the downfall of the Alliance, but changed the Democratic Party's political inner workings significantly. Thus, though the Democrats chose to ignore them, the Alliance posed as a serious threat to the stability of the Democratic Party in the White House and to a degree, in the South. The Farmer's Alliance and its eventual transformation into the Populist Party was significant not only because of Virginia's strong agricultural background, but also because of the Democrat's particular interest in Virginia as a very populous and influential Southern State."],"display_date":"March 3, 1892","search_date":"1892-03-03","locations":[{"id":14237,"lat":37.8135546685,"lng":-79.446551583,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1994,"title":"Governor Aaron V.

Brown of Tennessee spoke at a benefit for an orphan's asylum in Nashville, Tennessee. During his speech at Odd Fellow's Hall, he addressed the recent progress of the United States in regarding the escalating question of slavery. Governor Brown expressed the feelings of many southerners who felt threatened by the anti-slavery rhetoric in the North. The Governor also vividly exposed the hypocrisy of northerners in their efforts to end slavery, yet contain the African American population to the South. ","Governor Brown first questioned the constitutionality of northern sentiment to alter the institution of slavery. He specifically referred to the three-fifths clause in the Constitution that compared a slave's status to that of the white man. Brown asked if the Connecticut of today was unwilling to stand to the compact ratified by the Connecticut of 1787? In the eyes of Governor Brown any breakdown or change within the Constitution would lead to the breakdown of the Union. The South wished to stand by the compact made in 1787, while the North, whether directly or indirectly, wanted to break it. The Governor realized how much northern communities feared the infiltration of African Americans. Throughout the South, African Americans lacked equality to whites and lived under brutal oppression. But African Americans lived directly along side whites on a day to day basis. Slave women participated in raising their master's children, and some slave men acted as overseers and managed important aspects of the plantations on which they lived. Northerners did not live in close quarters with African Americans. They did not embrace them as part of their families as did many southerners. Governor Brown exemplified this point to his audience at Odd Fellow's Hall. He declared that once the North ensured African American's their escape from bondage, where shall they go? Who will receive them? Will the North? Never"," Governor Brown acknowledged, like many other southerners, that northerners did not feel a moral obligation to end slavery. Northerners sought to end slavery in order to better provide for themselves. According to Frederick Law Olmsted, northerners did not detest slavery, it is simply the negro competition and the monopoly of the opportunities to make money by negroe owners. Governor Brown and his fellow southerners knew that northerners wanted nothing to do with freed slaves and the competition for cheap labor they might create with a mass migration to the North. Poor, non-slaveholding whites in the South reaffirmed this fear for northerners. Frederick Law Olmstead suggests that poor white people were usually far better off in the free states, than in the slave. Northern interest in ending the spread of slavery correlated to their primary concern for ending the economical advancement of the elite South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":11953,"lat":36.1785835172,"lng":-86.867295434,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2017,"title":"The Dynamics of Virginia Politics in the 1880s\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-09-06","end_date":"1881-09-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 6, 1881 James Lyons, Jr. felt both nervous and excited about Virginia's upcoming gubernatorial election.  In a letter to Reuben Lindsay Gordon, an attorney from Louisa County, Virginia, Lyons asserted, I am watching eagerly and anxiously to see Louisa roll up a majority for Daniel and yourself.  You must get as big a majority as you can . . . I do hope you will win by a big vote.  Lyons was referring to the 1881 race between Democrat John Warwick Daniel and William Evan Cameron, the Readjuster candidate, for the position of Governor of Virginia.  The new Readjuster party of Virginia consisted of politicians who represented the interests of poor blacks and whites throughout the state.  Lyons's hopes for a Democratic win did not come to fruition; Cameron won the election, although only 53 percent of Virginians, a slim majority, voted in his favor.  As a result of the shifts in political power that occurred in the early 1880s and hopes for political reform, voters expressed newfound interest in elections.  Constituents from each political party harbored the hope that newly elected officials from their party would win and affect positive change in Virginia politics.","Politicians like Daniel in Central Virginia exerted major efforts during the 1880s and 1890s, not only to ensure that as many eligible citizens as possible would vote, but to also convince voters to vote for the right party.  Lyons articulated his understanding of the importance of every individual vote.  Democrats throughout Virginia worried about growing voter apathy and indifference at this time.  In <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, Edward Ayers points out that many voters in Virginia assumed, and rightly so, that elected officials acted as the puppets of a small number of wealthy, powerful men who made all of the political decisions from a distance.  As party leaders in Virginia knew that a difference of a few votes could determine the outcome of a race, some resorted to bribes, including monetary compensation and promises of appointment, to guarantee as many votes as possible.           ","Lyons had good reason to be excited about the Virginia gubernatorial election in 1881; at that time Virginia political parties battled fiercely for political power and positions in the state government.  The early 1880s witnessed a great deal of change in terms of the prominence of political parties in Virginia.  Republicans gained strength during this time; Democrats lost public support, as voters grew disillusioned over the inaction of the Democrats who had been elected to office, according to Ayers.  The Democrats who controlled the state government after the economic depression of the 1870s had failed to improve the state's debt.  Democrats like James Lyons who expressed strong support for their party in the 1870s and early 1880s quickly lost hope.  Few politicians pressed volatile issues or attempted to draw attention to problems that their party would rather ignore during the 1880s and 1890s.  ","Both the Republicans and Readjusters held Virginia for only a short period of time before the Democrats regained control in the 1884 election of Governor Cleveland.  Ayers explains that the large number of Democrats who continued to hold positions of power and influence during the reign of the Republicans and Readjusters prevented the parties from coalescing and forming a stable and secure power base throughout the state.  Despite the high hopes of the members of each political party of the time, voters remained disappointed by the lack of positive change or progress that politicians initiated in the 1880s and 1890s in Virginia."],"display_date":"September 6, 1881","search_date":"1881-09-06","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2026,"title":"Missourians Invade a Kansas Territory Election \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-01-04","end_date":"1855-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Reactions to the Kansas-Nebraska Act filled newspapers across the nation. <em>National Era</em>, an African-American newspaper based in Washington D.C. commented on the movement of pro-slavery people from Missouri into the Kansas territory. A letter from Governor Reeder of the Kansas territory, printed January 4, 1855, condemned the first election in the district for a delegate to Congress. Reeder stated that the majority of the people at the election meeting were not citizens of Kansas, but rather Missourians. These people rushed into the new territory only to return to their homes later that evening. Angry that Kansans were not making the decisions for the territory, he argued that the law guaranteed them the right to manage their own affairs. In a different article, a writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>was quoted as saying, If the thing [was] to be repeated, however, at every election in Kansas, it [would] ultimately lead to bloodshed. He went on to suggest that the Missourians were organized in separate parties...[each] designed to operate at specified locations. Members of such parties stood by the ballot box, asked to see people's ballots, and intimidated any person who did not support slavery."," Governor Reeder estimated that on that day anywhere from 200 to 400 Missourians came by ferry and horseback to vote in Kansas. Missourians reacted in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Under this act, popular sovereignty decided the issue of slavery in new territories. This meant newly forming states in the West had the right to vote whether they would be a slave state or free state. Reeder acknowledged his frustration that the people who lived in Kansas were not the ones who ultimately made the decisions. Historian David Potter states any resident could vote, however recently he arrived. Reeder recalled one man whose only attempt at a residence in Kansas [consisted] of a card nailed to a tree upon ground long since occupied by other settlers. "," Both Reeder and the writer of the letter to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that the Missourians who invaded the new territory supported slavery. Historian John B. Boles suggests there were as many as 5,000 fraudulent votes from border ruffians who wanted to ensure a pro-slavery candidate would be elected. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that an extensive scheme [was] on foot to make Kansas a slave state. Historian Clayton E. Jewett's argues that southerners used the annexation of western territories as a means of spreading slavery and gaining pro-slavery support in Congress. "," Tension mounted between the North and South as both sides struggled to control the future of slavery in new territories. Historian David Potter argues, Such friction was not unusual in frontier situations, and it often led to controversy, lawlessness, and violence. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> mentioned that the proslavery Missourians threatened and intimidated the judges, violently drove off all those who were suspected of being in favor of any other candidate than their own, and pointed revolvers as some cast their vote.

The Republicans of Missouri, taught by a sublime religion, remember that while to err is human, to forgive is divine. The Civil War had been over for over five years, but former rebels in Missouri still could not fully participate in the state government. Members of the State Republican Committee released this address on the eve of an election to fix the political character of the state. The announcement declared it was time to propose an amendment to the state constitution, granting the right of suffrage to those lately in rebellion. The last General Assembly decided by a respectable majority that the people at large would use a direct vote to resolve the question at hand. It was in the opinion of the State Republican Committee that civil privileges should be given back to those who rebelled. On August 12, 1870, the time [had] come when without danger to the state, full forgiveness and restoration to civil rights [could] be unconditionally given to those justly disfranchised."," At the conclusion of the Civil War, Radical Republicans in Missouri wanted to limit civil liberties to those people whose principles led directly to the recognition of universal manhood and universal freedom, with no paralyzing distinction of caste or of color. In order to ensure these ideals, the state government revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled against the Union. Not all whites welcomed the North's victory in the war. Missouri was a border state and had citizens who pledged loyalty to each side of the conflict. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney state that many southern whites reacted to military defeat and emancipation with dismay. These whites passed black codes denying blacks the right to vote and establishing what appeared to be a system of slavery without the name. To help prevent such measures, Radical Republicans in Missouri dissolved the current state government and created new state governments where rebels were excluded from power. In protecting the new rights of African Americans, the Republican Party thought the rebels were justly disfranchised. "," Missouri was not the only state that revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled. The national government also played an active role preventing former rebels from obstructing the integration of African Americans into southern society. According to Foner and Mahoney, Andrew Johnson's Presidential Reconstruction, offered a pardon to all Southern Whites, except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters, who took an oath of allegiance."," The time it took for rebels in Missouri to regain their right to vote and participate in the state government closely mirrored that of the rest of the country. In America's Reconstruction, Eric Foner claims that by 1870 all the former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union and that the rebels' regained their rights quickly thereafter. It took over five years, but by August 12, 1870, the State Republican Committee announced the state was ready to restore the civil rights to former supporters of the Confederacy."],"display_date":"April 12, 1870","search_date":"1870-04-12","locations":[{"id":7919,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST.

The soldiers had heard rumors of the great wealth of Georgia cotton planters. Now, with a freedman guide leading them to the house of Robert Paul where the ex-slave insisted they would find 15,000 in gold and silver, the soldiers hoped to seize a piece of that fortune for themselves.","The plan quickly fell apart. Arriving at the house, the soldiers took Mr. Paul captive and searched the place, discovering only their guide's disappearance into the night. Upset, the soldiers took what animals and possessions they could and set off down the road. Mr. Paul called on this neighbors and community. Soon, people gathered to the number of twelve or fourteen...among them many of the most respectable citizens of the county. This posse set off after the thieves, and while the soldiers had a considerable lead, they had no knowledge of the terrain. When the townsfolk caught up to the criminals, the soldiers opened fire, receiving a volley in kind from the assembled citizens. The soldiers ran, but did not make it far. One fell dead from his horse. The others, wounded and staggering, abandoned their horses and escaped into the nearby marshes. Paul recovered his property, excepting one bullet-ridden mare. The townsfolk reported the matter to the military government the next morning, who passed the investigation down the chain of command and eventually simply accepted the townsfolks' version of the events. The lieutenant in charge issued orders to commands around the city to arrest the escaped soldiers and to send someone from each command to identify the dead man.","     The military government's leniency in the matter differs greatly from the harsh, authoritarian rule of occupation armies in other parts of the South. Perhaps the military presence in and around Macon was too small to enforce order and welcomed the aid of civilians. Regardless, in the unrest and turbulence that followed immediately after the war, the occupation government in Twiggs County seems to have been remarkably willing to work with the local community, even to the extent of accepting dead soldiers. ","     In the immediate wake of being robbed, Mr. Paul did not seek the military government's aid in arresting its wayward soldiers. Rather, he resorted to a very common solution to crime and unrest in the 19th-century South - collective, vigilante justice. Despite the criminals' head start, the citizens of Twiggs County were able to spread the word, arm, organize, and catch up in only a few hours' time. This sort of call-to-arms, then, must not have been terribly rare. Indeed, even the most respected citizens of the county took part in the excursion - it seems that joining such a group was an honorable decision. Vigilantism, arguably native to America, was certainly engrained into this quiet Southern county. Long before lynching was synonymous with racial violence, communities in the Reconstruction South used collective violence to battle disturbances to the peace."],"display_date":"July 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-09","locations":[{"id":2289,"lat":32.670645545,"lng":-83.4297608837,"zoom":9,"place":"TWIGGS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2042,"title":"Feeding Prisoners on a Pittance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-20","end_date":"1861-11-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When S. N. Stallings signed up for service in the army of the Confederate States of America, he sought glory and excitement in the defense of his home and values. By 1861, Stallings' dreams had faded. Rather than fighting against invading hordes of Yankees, he was guarding prisoners of war at the courthouse in Barnwell County, South Carolina. ","Worse, the Confederate government had little interest in protecting the health of Stallings' wards. Writing to his friend, General J. N. Hammond of Barnwell, Stallings complains, I have eight thousand prisoners in jail and only receive thirty cents per day for food. With duty and humanity driving him to care for the men as best he could, Stallings wrote to friends such as Hammond to ask for whatever they could spare. Stallings joined the Confederate army hoping for glory, fortune, and advancement. Instead, he received a daily expence - both financially and emotionally. ","     The conditions of the camp drained Stallings' enthusiasm for army life. Each day, the prisoners under his case made reasonable demands: bread, butter, better housing. Each day he had to reject these requests. Soon he began to doubt the judgment of those who let such a state of affairs come to pass. Begging Hammond's opinion on the issue, Stallings offers his own bleak appraisal: I fear that we have weak and incompetent men at the head of affairs.","     Around 60 miles from Stallings' camp lay Andersonville, Georgia, the future home of the notorious prisoner-of-war camp. Like Barnwell (though on a larger scale), Andersonville suffered from overcrowding, food and material shortages, and the resulting deaths of a great many prisoners. The Northern press used Andersonville and Confederate prisons in general as a symbol of barbarity and dishonorable conduct on the part of the South; after the war ended, Henry Wirz, the commander in charge of Andersonville, was the only man executed for war crimes. Historians have debated the justice of this verdict for decades, some pointing out his constant but ineffective attempts to improve conditions. If Stallings' experience is any indication of the circumstances faced by the commander of such a camp, Wirz faced a truly impossible task.","     Prisoners-of-war in both North and South suffered keenly during their captivity. The best figures, while imprecise, estimate that 15.5 percent of the 194,000 Union prisoners died in captivity, a rate 28 percent higher than that for Confederate prisoners. Like in the case of the Barnwell captives, many historians name poor food as one of the causes for this disparity.

The older residents had warned the doctor that this season had been forebodingly hot and dead flies lay on the shores in great numbers.","Dupre moved fast. He bled the patient and gave him thirty ounces of olive oil in three doses. He also let him drink freely of the anti-febrile pineapple water. Other remedies he considered were almond oil, lime juice, and calomel in doses from 20 to 30 grams. Over the next two days, the sailor improved greatly, his skin cooler to the touch and the yellowness of his eyes dissipating. In his journal, Dupre recounted that encounter with the deadly disease and others over the course of his summer in Key West; the greatest number of cases occurred during a ten day period in mid-July.","Of greater importance to physicians all over the South were the origin and vector of the disease. Dupre put forth his hypothesis that the elevation of the site, the humidity of the soil, and the presence of marsh miasmata were only secondary influences in its genesis. Yellow fever would remain a mystery for much of the century, drastically altering the development of southern cities.","Almost fifty years later, Dr. J.C. LeHardy read a report in front of the Medical Association of Georgia that echoed Dupre's journal. Elevation was clearly a factor, as epidemics in St. Augustine originated in the low, rain-washed suburbs around the city. The moisture in the soil and the tropical sun that bathed the South were also primary factors in the breeding of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the vector of the disease. LeHardy asked the Medical Association how the South, a region that clothed the world and fed the hemisphere with her long growing seasons and immense forests, could have no large cities. He answered the question himself; the lakes, lagoons, and swamps across the region created an atmosphere for a horrific contagion that only drainage of the soil through canals and cleanliness could remedy. ","Dupre and LeHardy were not alone in their frustration. Yellow fever disrupted the entire fabric of life in the South. Many lost faith in the medical profession as they struggled to find answers, and outbreaks brought commerce to a complete halt. An epidemic in Pensacola in 1822 caused so many residents to flee inland that the Floridian, a prominent newspaper, shut down for lack of revenue. Outside investment capital saw the South as a risk. A later Florida epidemic in 1841 decimated such a large part of the population that it almost delayed Florida's admission to the Union. Florida, in close trading proximity to Havana, Cuba, was especially prone to importation of the disease. ","Despite all yellow fever's devastating effects, it fueled the growth of public health in the South. State legislatures created Boards of Health to prevent and isolate outbreaks, and the United States Public Health Service acquired funding, staffing, and authority to combat yellow fever. Throughout the nineteenth century, citizens demanded greater government involvement in disease control and better institutions to meet their needs."],"display_date":"June 8, 1841","search_date":"1841-06-08","locations":[{"id":1426,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2054,"title":"Battle for the Chesapeake Oysters\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-12-06","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lieutenant Dryden was furious. The Award of 1877, which defined the boundary between Virginia and Maryland through the Chesapeake Bay, was bad enough. It ceded many of the most bountiful beds in the Pocomoke Sound to the dredgers of Virginia, but the Virginians refused to respect even those boundaries. Dryden and his fellow watermen decided to respond with force. For three weeks, his men riddled Virginia poachers with rifle fire. However, when Dryden and his men renewed their tonging, they found that only trashy-looking oysters remained. The Virginians had licked the bar with their destructive dredging practices. In revenge, Dryden and the other oystermen raided the Virginia beds. The Tangier, a Virginia police schooner, attacked them, and chased the tongers back to Smith Island. There, Dryden and the Maryland oystermen fired over 500 rounds on the Virginia police. The captain of the Tangier, A. J. Read, returned fire with his cannon. The Smith Islanders threw up barricades on the island, and dared Read to try to beach his craft. The Captain was unwilling to storm the beach, though, and the Tangier retreated back to the other side of the line.","Southern states increasingly regulated and defended their economic interests in the years after the Civil War. The War devastated the economies of many parts of the South, and these states sought to recover stability and growth through an active role in economic affairs. Maryland and Virginia fought over their boundary line through the Chesapeake Bay because each had economic interests in the Bay's valuable oyster fields. After a complex survey, the Award of 1877 settled the issue. Oystermen were notorious for not respecting the boundaries: many dredgers trawled at night in boats painted black with mud-covered sails. In response, each state created police forces to secure the boundary and the oysters. Open gunfire between the police boats and the oystermen was common throughout the 1870s and 1880s.","The police vessels also tried to limit the more destructive oyster industry practices, such as dredging. Many reports in the Baltimore Sun detail cases involving dredgers exceeding their tonnage limit without the proper license. The police forces regulated dredging because Virginians and Marylanders increasingly saw the oysters as an economic asset belonging to the state. A Marylander named Howard Hamans proposed leasing the bay bottom to dredgers instead of letting them take what they pleased. The money from this plan could be used to fund state projects like road construction. Hamans believed that dredgers squandered a precious natural resources belonging to the citizens of Maryland. After the Civil War, southern states like Maryland and Virginia tried to protect these economic interests, and even used guns to do so."],"display_date":"December 6, 1883 - December 31, 1883","search_date":"1883-12-18","locations":[{"id":6063,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition. ","In the same paper and on the same day, an advertisement was posted for slaves wanted. The headline read, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES. Mr. James H. Birch, of Washington City, was in hopes of acquiring more slaves on that January day. He advertised for slaves of both sexes, with ages ranging from 12 to 25 years old. He offered to pay higher prices, in cash, than any other purchaser in the market. ","<em>The Washington Globe</em> exemplified the divide between abolitionists and the slave South in its two contradictory features in 1837. That day's article and advertisement, with very differing views, showed the divide between Northern and Southern ideologies. Edward Pessen writes about this distinction in How Different from Each Other Were the Antebellum North and South? He describes the different regions as two distinctive civilizations, the basic similarities within each of which transcended its internal differences. He calles the slavery issue an irrepressible conflict, a fundamental difference between the two civilizations. <em>The Globe </em>showed how the issues of abolition and slavery were everywhere in Washington in 1837."],"display_date":"January 10, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-10","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2066,"title":"Today is an era in my life- Big day in Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-06-30","end_date":"1840-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Tuesday June 30, 1840, Mr. Richard Rawlins continued his stay in the nation's capital.  However, this day in Washington was not your typical day.  He started his diary entry by stating, Today is an era in my life.  In this one day, Mr. Rawlins was able to see the Declaration of Independence, call on and present letters of introduction and converse with Henry Clay as well as John Quincy Adams.  The Declaration was kept in a mahogany case in the State Department.  Already, some of the signatures were almost illegible due to fading.  The parchment bore evidence of being rolled up tightly.  Viewing documents of such significance sent a chill through Mr. Rawlins body. After viewing these historic documents he ventured to the John Quincy Adams' house, there he presented a letter from Mr. Cranch.  It was shocking how old Adams looked, his head almost entirely bald.  The little hair he did possess was silvery in color.  Afraid of staying too long, Rawlins quickly left.  He continued his day with a visit to the residence of Henry Clay, again to deliver a letter.  This visit delighted Rawlins, as Clay was dignified yet cordial.  His smile was peculiarly placid. Clay was tall and slender, with thin grey hair, small eyes, and a wide mouth, making him appear to possess a constant smile.  As if visiting Adams and Clay was not enough for one day, Rawlins also met with John Calhoun in the Senate.  He ended this day of activity with an evening of feasting at Judge Cranch's.  ","The men Mr. Rawlins was able to meet in his day in Washington were some of the top political actors in the nation at that time.  William Cooper, Jr. and Thomas Terrill, in <em>The American South- A History</em>, shed light on the background of a few of these monumental figures.  Henry Clay was John Quincy Adam's Secretary of State during his tenure as President.  As President, Adams envisioned a strong central government.  This only worsened tensions with the South.  It is no surprise that meeting these two men, who played divergent roles in the life of the country, was a day Mr. Rawlins described as, An era in my life.

One moment he was laughing and joking with friends; then his life changed drastically. He received a letter from home. Upon opening it, he fell directly to the ground, as if he had been shot. The first words he managed to utter, Every tie to life is broken He had received new of his daughter's death. Although he became more composed as the day progressed, he was heartbroken. Ann was his pride and joy, and of all his children she was his greatest comfort. She was frank, gay, and warm hearted. Ann married a very rich man and lived on a plantation adjourning Clay's. They interacted daily. Of five daughters, Ann was the last. Mrs. Clay also suffered at the thought of life without the joy of her daughters. Mr. Clay responded to a sympathy letter on December 31, 1835. In this he thanked a friend for her kind words but explained, All the efforts of friendship or of my own mind have but little effect on a heart as wounded as mine is. His dear Ann had tastes, sympathies, and amusements identical to his own. She was interwoven into every plan he held for his future. The loss of Ann was one that could never be repaired, there is nothing before me in the world but duties. ","Henry Clay was one of the top political players during this time in United States history. This letter, describing his deep loss and the pain Ann's death brought him, provides a very personal glance into his life. Clay served in both the House and the Senate and, despite his multiple failed attempts at the Presidency, he still managed to leave his mark on history. He was the founder of the Whig Party, in opposition of Andrew Jackson. Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra describe Clay in their book, New Histories of the Old Dominion, Virginia Reconsidered, as a man who brought to the political stage the very qualities women did on the domestic one- moral virtue, love of harmony, and the willingness to compromise. They go on to say that women were endeared to him. Perhaps this affection, passion, and love of harmony are in part a reaction the great loss of his dear Ann. Clay's favorite word was harmony and he has gone down in history as a peacemaker and the Great Pacificator. On Christmas day, 1835, Clay suffered a loss that would forever change him.

He had always desired to see the city. The city was the object of greatest curiosity, fascinating the Bishop with its rich history. He stood in awe before a portrait of George Washington. The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced. Stanley Harrold writes in his book, <em>The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861</em>, about the growing white and black abolitionist's movement during this time. Garrisonians were fighting for the freedom of enslaved blacks across the South. Bishop was originally from the North and agreed with the Garrisonians.

He marveled at the beauty of the city and was inspired by the men who fought to establish both the great nation. However, on the afternoon of May 1, 1844, another new and exciting sight fascinated Whipple. The wonder of wonders was Professor Morse's electrical telegraph. Through the electrical telegraph, information was transmitted with almost the rapidity of thought. Railroad cars left with information of a nomination, for example, at the same time as the telegraph. However, the news transported via the telegraph was received one hour and a half before the cars arrived. The machine was simple and plain. Professor Morse had been working on it for 12 years. He gave Bishop Whipple a specimen of the writing as well as an explanation of the work. He was also able to hold communication with the man at the other end of the route. Bishop Whipple said he would never again doubt the extent of man's inventive powers. Wonderful, it is just wonderful He wrote of his time in Washington, There is much to please the eye, much novel and curious to investigate, and while I live I shall ever remember with pleasure my visit to Washington.","The invention of the telegraph, which so amazed Bishop Whipple, was a development that transformed the nation from in the 1800s. According to Tomas Nonnenmacher, writing in <em>The Journal of Economic History</em>, the telegraph industry began as a single monopoly patent and grew into a national monopoly. Nonnenmacher pointed out the significance of the telegraph in the development of technology: prior to the telegraph people relied on the Pony Express, homing pigeons, and the railroads. The invention spurred growth in many markets across the country, reducing information costs between firms and making news quickly transmittable over long distances.

R. Henry of Tazewell County, Virginia campaigned for a seat in Congress under the Democratic Party in 1886. People from neighboring communities such as Lynchburg, Abingdon and Wytheville voiced their full support of his campaign and hopes for his success in the quest for a seat in Congress in the November elections. Although varied in their syntax, the message behind Henry's supporters emphasized the same ideas and qualities that would make him an ideal candidate for Congress. His supporters all commented not only upon his strength, using words like commanding, but also upon his masculinity and physical appearance. He was characterized as being both tall and handsome and being a true type of physical and mental manhood. They also reflected upon class and status, typifying him as a gentleman of culture and character and a first class man in every respect. His supporters made continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army. With all of the praise that was given to Major R. R. Henry, one can only notice what was not being commented upon by his supporters, his strengths in the political arena. There is no mention of their support of his platform or any political ideas that he may have had, instead emphasizing his physical and moral character.","This article exemplifies the qualities that were found to be important in any political campaign during that time. Henry's character was found to be more important then the political decisions he has made in the past and any experience that he has in the political arena. Also, the continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army is reminiscent of the mounting processions many of the Democratic candidates used at that time. In these mounting processions, the candidate would ride in front of a long line of people mimicking Robert E. Lee to touch Confederate sentiments. Perhaps the lack of hard hitting platform issues may be due to the defeat of the Democratic Party in the assembly resulting in the party trying to avoid any friction that would result in future lost elections. ","It was also during this time that sectional diplomacy in the South became a prominent issue in politics. There was a divide in the South in forming either a Northeastern alliance or a Western alliance. This divide led to the formation of an Alliance Platform, which later became the platform adopted by the Populist Party. Many politicians of this time adopted this controversial platform, which emphasized subtreasury plans and other Southern ideals. It may be the case that for Major Henry, the lack of a political platform in the news article reflects the tension in platforms of the time. By leaving out any political ideation, and focusing on the physical and moral characteristics of the candidate, Henry might avoid the struggle within the political system relating the Alliance platform, and reach the constituents based on a more universally accepted stance - morality and character.

It seemed that people supporting the temperance movement had overlooked another venue in which alcohol might have been ingested, which could cause harm. The newspaper warned of the use of alcohol in food preparation, specifically in the pleasant sauces and the dishes of home. It was seen as more dangerous because the use of alcohol in food preparation may not be seen as harmful. It would leave one vulnerable to the evils of alcohol in not recognizing that any ingestion of alcohol would be detrimental to his or her life. The article further delved into the relationship between women and whiskey. It claimed that women and whiskey were natural antagonists. Also, the use of any form led to the destruction of the women's home and family and so the article urged women that it was their duty to refrain from the use of whiskey to save the peace and purity of the home. Finally, the article urged the women of the home to drive out the snake of intemperance. It warned against the use of alcohol for medicinal purposes reporting that physicians claim that whiskey did more damage than the human ill itself.","This article illustrates the shift in focus for the temperance movement in the late nineteenth century. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, temperance based many of its assertions upon explicit biblical texts. The temperance movement during these times made it a religious duty resting upon divine sanctions. Many of the anti-temperance organizations and meetings resembled evangelical prayer meetings, with those that signed pledges to sobriety called converts giving testimony and signing hymns praising temperance. ","The shift in the focus of the temperance movement began as early as the 1840s with the formation of the Washingtonians and fraternal temperance organizations that did not make religion a prominent issue. Also, the formation of the Christian Women's Temperance Union in 1874 and the Anti-Saloon League in 1893 resulted in a shift in the overall structure basis of the temperance movement. These organizations had Protestant tones, but did not rely upon explicit biblical text as the reason for abstinence, but shifted more towards pragmatic reasons, demonstrated in the article above. Reference to the snake of intemperance makes an allusion perhaps to the devil, but the crux of the article against drinking focuses on more practical reasons, such as detriment to one's health. Prior organizations focused upon the moral aspects that surrounded the temperance movement, while later groups focused on legal means to achieve an alcohol free society. With this type of shift, the explicit biblical arguments did not hold much weight in support of temperance."],"display_date":"1890 - 1900","search_date":"1895-07-02","locations":[{"id":14278,"lat":36.8438879121,"lng":-81.53700883,"zoom":9,"place":"SMYTH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2079,"title":"Strange Encounter and Counterfeit Money\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-12-04","end_date":"1891-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 4th, 1891, F. W. Leonard, the sheriff of Smyth County, Virginia received a letter from the sheriff of Barber County in Kansas. A man described by the Kansas sheriff as being 40 years old, 5 feet 8 inches in height and of dark complexion was seen wondering around Barber County, Kansas. The sheriff also described the man as being crazy. When questioned by the Kansas sheriff the stranger, who signed the name William J., said that he was from 7 Mile Ford, which is in close proximity to Smyth County. Also, the man, William, was accused by the sheriff in Barber County to be making paper money. The sheriff of Barber County made no indication that William J. had been arrested in connection to the paper money. Leonard was notified to see if a family member or friend of William J., would come to take him back to 7 Mile Ford. ","This episode highlights another instance of counterfeiting money that occurred in the South during the 19th Century. Although the money made by William J. was not seen by the sheriff of Barber County, Kansas as a systematic counterfeit system, it brought attention to the measures taken beginning in the 1830s to detect counterfeit bank notes. Prior to the national bank system put into place after the war, the predominant system of banking was state run. Therefore there were many state issued bank notes in circulation. The issue of such state bank notes caused much paper money confusion in the 1840s and 1850s. These bank notes had similar characteristics of shape, size, color and engraved notes, but the discount rate of these species varied and were difficult to determine. Between the 1840s and 1860s there was a multitude of state banks, each issuing their own bank notes having particular denomination and design. Many times, unskilled tradesman would accept both legitimate bank notes as well as the counterfeit without knowing the difference between the two. It was not until Robert T. Bicknell of Philadelphia began publishing a bank note reporter and counterfeit detector in 1830 that merchants were able to distinguish between the legitimate and counterfeit state bank notes. These counterfeit detecting services attempted to answer the question presented to many merchants, which were, first, if the note is genuine; second, is the issuing bank still in operation; and third, at what discount rate was this note acceptable. To answer these questions the bank note reporters and counterfeit detector contained items regarding locations of banks, the usual bank note list and a list of counterfeit and altered notes. However, the bank note reporter was no longer published by 1866, when a tax was issued on bank notes, leading to the abolishment of the use of such state issued notes. ","Perhaps William J., being described as crazy was trying to pass off the state money issued prior to the civil war while he was in Kansas, and was unaware that the use of that type of money was no longer valid.

Two African American brothers, James Grubb and Bud Grubb were making preparations for the holidays in Wytheville, Virginia. The two brothers had been heavily drinking while they were in town. Bud was described as being full up when they eventually returned home. Upon their arrival to their home, Bud began physically abusing his sister at which point James tried to intervene. Bud then attacked James with a razor, James then reacted by shooting his brother in the chest, delivering a fatal wound. James then fled the scene and managed to evade police apprehension. Almost a year and a half later, James Grubb surrendered himself to police for the murder of his brother, Bud Grubb. His bail was set at 500 dollars. His trial was set for later that month, but the outcome was unknown. ","A year prior to the conclusion of this criminal case, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, which enacted the separate but equal rule for the civil rights of African Americans. In response to this doctrine, the court system attempted to prevent Southern state courts from obstructing justice against African Americans by giving federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases. The purpose of this legislation was to establish a sense of equality among blacks and whites. Potential inequality could arise in the southern states where slavery and the oppression of African Americans had been legally allowable. However, it was also during this period Jim Crow laws, both formal and informal, were enacted in the region. Contrary to previous legislation to give federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases, the federal courts from Reconstruction onward consistently and frequently decreed Jim Crow segregation to be constitutional and consistent with the law of the lands. Not only did the Jim Crow laws affect African American standing both socially and economically, but also with respect to protection from the law. African Americans were subject to greater rates of incarceration and harsher sentences compared to whites who committed the same crime."," Also during this time, community-sanctioned lynching occurred, where mobs would take an alleged criminal (usually African American), torture, mutilate and kill them. The Grubb family murder would be less likely to result in a lynching because it occurred within the family and it occurred between two African Americans. Although the outcome of the trial was not reported, as a result of the Jim Crow laws and the atmosphere of unequal distribution of justice, the Grubb brother would most likely receive a harsher penalty then a member of the white community.

The feud began after the 1884 election when Cook Humphrey defeated Sam Goodson for the position of sheriff. John Day and Floyd Tolliver were accused of beating John Martin with a club after words were exchanged over the election of Humphrey. This incident was the beginning of the bloody feud between the two families, which ended in thousands of dollars worth of destroyed property and more then twenty-one people dead. The severity of the feud became apparent when the Tolliver family attempted to kill Cook Humphrey, the current sheriff of the town. Subsequently the Tollivers were put on trial, but the court proceedings were not up to the standards of the letter of the law. The attorney presented false witness and the judge was partial to the Tolliver family, which led to the Tollivers being released to the public and the charges being dismissed. ","On the orders of the Governor of Kentucky (who recognized the severity of the Tolliver - Martin feud), Sheriff Hogg assembled a posse of 100 well-armed men to arrest Craig Tolliver and other members of the Tolliver family for the murder and destruction that resulted from the feud. When Craig Tolliver was confronted by the posse led by Sheriff Hogg, he quickly retreated to Cottage Hotel where he and four of his followers barricaded themselves inside the building. After a short battle between the two parties that included about two hours of gunfire, Craig Tolliver along with four other conspirators lay dead at the hands of the posse. ","The Tolliver - Martin Feud exemplifies the typical feudal violence in Kentucky?s volatile environment between the periods of 1875 - 1900. During this period, the Appalachia area was riddled with family feuds ending in much bloodshed and destruction. It has been argued that much of the feuding resulted essentially from the ineffectiveness of the law and lawlessness caused by the Civil War. Many of the local courts and county governments were left ineffective leading to social disorder. This social disorder caused many people to turn to forms of private violence and revenge, consequently turning into many of the feuds seen in the Appalachia region during the 1880s and 1900s. ","Also, it was not uncommon for feuds in this region to occur close to district election days, as seen with the Tolliver feud, which began after the election of Humphrey Cook for sheriff. These election districts were an important feature and chief political unit for inhabitants of the Appalachian region because of its separateness emphasized geographically by the mountains and rivers surrounding the area. The election districts formalized the neighborhood networks that bound families the rest of the year. "," The results of these feuds caused many people to leave the state of Kentucky in search of safer lands. Also, Kentuckians were stereotyped in a very unbecoming light. They were seen as violent, and uneducated, which made Kentucky an undesirable place for people to live. This stereotype which resulted in less people moving and living in Kentucky could have had a major effect upon their economic situation.

At a time when massive advancements were being made in the areas of agriculture, factory production, transportation, and communication, Richmond's General Assembly was still reeling from the logistics of such a massive overhaul. In early January, an advertisement was taken out in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser alerting the public to a petition about to be presented to the Assembly. If passed, the newspaper said, the petition would allow a railroad to be constructed, from the Coal Mines in Chesterfield, to some eligible point on James River, below Whitby bar as well as a line that would end near Belona Arsenal, in said county. At the time this issue was being voted on, Richmond (like the United States) was at a crossroads of economic growth. More than ever, industrial success depended on tying resources, markets, and people together in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Railroads were becoming the preferred way to do this, and any effort by the legislature to build an expensive railroad needed a lot of public support. ","But why was the General Assembly so eager to link coal mines with industrial centers (like Richmond) on the James River? The answer reflects an underlying fear that plagued many Virginians in the early nineteenth century: economic inferiority. Virginia had been a dominant producer of coal in the early decades of the nation's history, but by the 1830's the state was beginning to feel the strain of economic division. Rather than devoting itself completely to the production of one good (like states in the deeper South who depended on cotton), Virginia had diversified. As a result, coal miners in the west found themselves in competition with planters in the east for slave labor and transportation resources. This strain resulted in high prices and poor quality, setting Virginia behind other coal-producing states further north. Railroads represented a possible remedy for this problem, and would give entrepreneurs the ability to move coal from the mines to Richmond fast enough to be competitive with other states. Unfortunately, even the infusion of new technology brought on by the Industrial Revolution could not save Virginia's mining business. Although officials in Richmond tried to revive the industry (and gain public support), coal mining in the state was destined to remain the victim of arrested industrialization."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2126,"title":"The Ill-Mannered Welcome of Judge White\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1840-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The honorable Judge Hugh L. White's welcome upon passing through the town of Rogersville, Tennessee, on his return trip home to Knoxville, was anything but warm. Upon his arrival, the former United States Senator was greeted with a large strip of cotton covered with insulting comments stretched across the main entrance to the town. The citizens behind this offensive act were members of the local Van Buren Party. These citizens were of the same group who had recently aided in removing White from his seat in the Senate. Many members of the town had pleaded with the Van Buren Party members that the banner be removed before his arrival. Their protests, however, were to no avail, and the sign was hoisted in anticipation of his entrance. The Judge and his party decided against passing under the sign, and bypassed the street altogether upon seeing the unwelcoming reception which awaited them at the town's entry. ","This offensive deed was most likely the Democratic reaction to Judge White's perceived misrepresentation of the views of his constituency during his term in the United States Senate. Hugh L. White and Ephraim H. Foster served as Tennessee Senators representing the Whig Party at a time when a fierce political battle between the Whigs and the Democrats raged in Tennessee as well as on the national level. During this time, the Democratic electorate of Tennessee felt that their interests were not being represented in Washington by their two Whig senators. A plan was devised in the State Legislature to force White and Foster to either resign or support the policy of Democratic President Martin Van Buren. Consequently, Senators White and Foster both resigned and were replaced by Democrats. ","The narrative of Judge White demonstrates just how strongly local Democrats of the town of Rogersville opposed their representation by the Whig Party. In accordance with this event, historian Jonathan M. Adkins argues that the core issue of this conflict between Whig and Democrat was the question of which party would best represent the people. Though Tennessee in the 1840's was split fairly evenly between both parties, the Democrats certainly made their opinions known about who they believed would better represent their state. These attitudes were evidenced by the chilling reception Judge White received from local Van Buren supporters.

National unrest had been building throughout the United States for quite some time, and sectional pressure between the North and South was nearing its boiling point. Those people living in Virginia's capital sensed the impending conflict more than most. Mere months before the South Carolina nullification crisis erupted, John Campbell, a politically active Virginian, returned home to Richmond after extensive travel throughout the country. Immediately upon arriving in the city, Campbell was struck by the attitude of the Virginians he encountered. From all I see and hear since my return home [to Virginia], he wrote to his friend Claiborne Watts Gooch, I think the people of the South (SC included) will support, by a strong vote, the [Presidential] nominee of the [Democratic] Convention. President Andrew Jackson's power, he believed, could not be shaken by any foreseeable event. Campbell immediately gauged the attitude of the South and saw fit to place his faith in the extremely popular Jackson, who would be indirectly nominated for a second term by the first-ever Democratic nominating convention held in Baltimore in 1832.","Campbell did admit to himself, however, that Henry Clay (a Whig) and John Calhoun (a secessionist) would do just about anything to destroy Martin Van Buren, who was then serving Jackson's Vice President, and Jackson himself. Calhoun, he believed, was pushing for disunion in a vain grab for power, hoping to become the eventual king or emperor of a Southern republic. This attitude was surprising coming from a Southerner at a time when regional solidarity was growing, and Calhoun was seen as the face of an increasingly separatist movement. Campbell also voiced his sneaking suspicion that the secessionists (Clay and Calhoun) had a personal interest in separation and were not representing the will of their constituents. Jackson, he felt, could harmonize the Union and preserve American liberty as he had done before. Our Liberty is gone when our Union is dissolved, he wrote. Why should we throw away the fruits of the toil and blood of the fathers of the Revolution? Is it because a Clay or a Calhoun wishes to be President, and the people are too slow in gratifying their ambition? "," Campbell's own opinion after returning to Richmond is significant not only in its foresight (the Union eventually dissolving) but also in its point of view. Campbell was a Southerner living in what would become the capital of the Confederacy, yet he had reservations about nullification and great faith in national unity. In the course of studying the antebellum period, we often assume that all Southern males, for example, thought alike. In reality, there were those that disagreed with nullification and those who did not trust the so-called spokesmen of the South. John Campbell's letter serves as an interesting study of Southern dissent mere months before the North/South divide came sharply into focus."],"display_date":"June 28, 1832","search_date":"1832-06-28","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2138,"title":"Adoption of an Ordinance in Marietta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-02-13","end_date":"1852-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jenny, an African American woman residing in Marietta, Georgia, desperately wanted to move. In 1852, the local government of Marietta passed an ordinance against negroes hiring out their own time or living on lots to themselves. This new law was greatly at odds with Jenny's current living situation. Jenny believed that under the law she would no longer prosper at her current residence. Faced with these unfavorable circumstances, she traveled to Atlanta to see if her options there would be any better. In the city, she encountered a certain Mr. Jeremiah who agreed to take her in on his lot and protect her. To determine whether or not Jenny could take this course of action, Andrew J. Hansell sent a letter to Farish Carter asking for him to approve of her removal to Atlanta.","What remains unclear in this episode is the status of Jenny, the African American woman who desired to relocate. It seems as if Jenny's lifestyle had been seriously affected on account of the passage of Marietta's ordinance. Her displeasure with the new law indicates that she was either hiring herself out for work or living on a lot to herself. Considering these factors, one might conclude that Jenny was a free black. However, the letter sent from Hansell to Carter requesting approval for Jenny to move to Atlanta implied that Jenny was not free to make decisions concerning her place of residence. This letter also mentioned that Jenny would have to return home if she was not permitted to move to Atlanta. The use of the word <em>home</em> indicated that her inhabitance of the dwelling in Marietta was only temporary. ","This incident shows the types of measures local governments in the Antebellum South took to deprive African Americans of what little freedom they had left to enjoy. Due to the passage of Marietta's ordinance, a free black community, like that of Israel Hill in Virginia that historian Melvin Ely describes in his book <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, would never be realized in Cobb County. On Israel Hill, free blacks were permitted to live independently and hire themselves out as laborers. Ely does note, however, that as the issue of slavery grew on the federal level in the 1850's, whites tried once again to reduce the status of free blacks down to a level very close to slavery. It is quite possible that this retrogression of attitudes towards slavery was what the slaves and free blacks of Marietta saw with the passage of the Ordinance in the early 1850's.

McClellan wrote to his friend Patrick Ragland, informing him of his views on the state of the Whig Party and the upcoming election. McClellan emphatically told Ragland that he intended to support the Whig nominee, General Winfield Scott, and the platform upon which he would run for the presidency. McClellan also expressed feelings of utter disgust with Ragland for even having asked him in his last letter if he would consider voting for Scott's opponent, Franklin Pierce of the Democratic Party. He even went so far as to inquire whether Ragland was deranged for asking such a question. McClellan proclaimed that, in order for him to leave the Whig Party, there would have to be reasons much more enticing than the candidacy of Franklin Pierce. He then went on to belittle the resume of Pierce and satirize him by saying how he small of a man he would appear if he were to wear the uniform of an esteemed General as Winfield Scott. ","From the contents of his letter, it can be inferred that McClellan was a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of the Whig Party. Although Pierce had served as a member of Congress and fought in the Mexican-American War, in McClellan's eyes, he was an inadequate candidate and was unworthy to even challenge such a man as Winfield Scott. While it appears that McClellan would have voted for the Whig ticket regardless of the candidate, his letter to Ragland implies that others may not have felt the same way. When asked about the views of the Whig Party in general with regard to Scott's nomination, he replied that although most Whigs were in favor of his candidacy, others were afraid that the advocacy of some of Scott's claims would hinder their future political aspirations. He also spoke of how Alabama congressman James Abercrombie left the Whig party altogether on account of Scott's nomination. ","This letter is telling of the strife that occurred within the Party on the eve of the 1852 presidential election. At this time, two factions, one Northern and one Southern, had formed within the Whig Party. The opposition between these two groups was on account of the abolitionist sentiments of the Northern Whigs. At the time of the nominating convention, the Southern Whigs heavily favored the candidacy of incumbent president, Millard Fillmore, to best protect their interests. Therefore, for many Southern Whigs, the nomination of Scott was not a favorable occurrence. According to historian Lewy Dorman, the election results of 1852 reflected the shift in allegiance of many Alabama Whigs to the Democratic Party whom they felt could better serve their interests. This goes to show that not all Southern Whigs were as devoted to their party as Thomas McClellan. In the Election of 1852, many Alabamians cast aside long held party allegiances in favor of their own best interests. This event marked both the decline of the Whig Party and the rise of sectionalism in the United States."],"display_date":"July 25, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-25","locations":[{"id":232,"lat":34.8100816932,"lng":-86.9813367451,"zoom":9,"place":"LIMESTONE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2149,"title":"Reaction to Nullification\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-11-04","end_date":"1832-11-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1832, Sophia Hunt, a Democrat living in Woodville, Mississippi, received a letter from her father in South Carolina describing the recent crisis of his state.

"," Although the threat of civil war seemed improbable to southerners like Sophia in the 1830s, southern farmers and northern merchants had different economic interests at this time. This became an important issue when John Quincy Adams passed the Tariff of 1828. Southerners felt that the tariff favored the North, and swiftly voted Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, into office. However, Jackson failed to remove the tariff. South Carolina, fearful that the Federal Government had become too powerful, issued the Ordinance of Nullification in 1832. The Ordinance stated that South Carolina would no longer collect the tariff. The state began to raise troops to protect its new legislation. Jackson responded by instituting the Force Acts, which allowed him to send troops into South Carolina if the state continued to ignore the tariff. Many southerners who had staunchly supported Jackson were appalled at his institution of the Force Acts. They viewed his actions as an assault on states' rights. Still, like Sophia, the overwhelming majority of the South did not support South Carolina. The state's threats to secede were just too extreme. In January 1833, Mississippi's House of Representatives released a statement condemning South Carolina for acting impulsively. The report declared that the Ordinance of Nullification opposed the Constitution. Still, Mississippi's legislature did not fully support Jackson either as a result of the Force Acts. Many citizens, including Governor Abram M. Scott, believed that Mississippi should stand behind its fellow southern state by contesting Jackson's Force Acts. They thought that the tariff should be lowered. Even some supporters of Jackson expressed sympathy for South Carolina. Although views on the crisis were varied, Mississippi could not encourage disunion. Mississippians like Sophia could not have foreseen at this time that the country would be thrown into civil war in fewer than thirty years. Though the states had divided interests, on the dawn of the 1830s civil war was simply unimaginable."],"display_date":"November 4, 1832","search_date":"1832-11-04","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2152,"title":"Controversy Surrounding the Panic of 1837\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-02-14","end_date":"1838-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John F.

Cass was concerned about the policy that the government would take regarding the Native Americans living in the United States. Cass admitted that whites had harmed the Indians for the past two centuries, and he saw the need to make up for this damage. It would be best for the Indians, he declared, if they were moved west of the Mississippi River. Certainly if they remained in white communities their race would be eventually be destroyed. Cass argued that the average Native American was lazy and stubborn and feared the anger of the Great Spirit should he depart from the customs of his fathers. Because of these characteristics, Cass said, Indians would not realize that whites were genuinely attempting to help them. The best course of action would be to remove the Indians and let them learn from the example of the white settlers. "," The subject of Cass's letter was an important issue in Mississippi in 1832. Until 1830 the Choctaws and the Chickasaws possessed the majority of the land in Mississippi. This began to change immediately after Andrew Jackson assumed office. On January 17, 1930, Mississippi extended its governance over Native American lands, which forced the Native American tribes to move westward if they wanted to maintain their independent government. In the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek the Choctaws agreed to move westward, and in 1832 the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek removed the Chickasaws as well."," The removal of the Choctaw and the Chickasaw changed Mississippi on economic, social, and political levels. White males looking for new opportunities would have been ecstatic to open their local newspaper and see Cass's suggestions to the president. According to historian John Ray Skates, The Indian cessions tripled the public lands available for settlement and provoked explosive changes for the state of Mississippi. Suddenly a huge expanse of land was open and ready to be transformed into cotton fields. "," The plantation owners of Mississippi Delta, however, may have been less excited about the new abundance of land. As more and more people flooded into the remainder of the state, the old plantation owners in the river counties were quickly outnumbered and began to lose political power. Most of the new settlers were Democrats, unlike most of the politicians from the Delta. The new settlers moved the state capital out of the Delta, from Natchez to Jackson. Then, in 1832, the government of Mississippi declared universal suffrage for white men and terminated property holding requirements for office. The plantation owners of the Delta no longer had political control over the state. Although citizens of the Delta probably agreed with Cass that the Indians should be moved, ultimately, they were not happy with the political changes that resulted."],"display_date":"1830 - 1832","search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2163,"title":"Futile Attempts for Justice\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-07-15","end_date":"1867-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On the night of July 15, 1867, three African American men arrived in Jefferson County, Mississippi, and asked a local policeman where they could remain for the night. The policeman said he would take them to the local jail where they could sleep, and then release them the next morning. Instead, the three men were detained for six days and made to dig post holes around the jail. After they were finally released, they complained to the mayor and he responded to them that they were lucky they were not sent to the state penitentiary. The Assistant Commissioner for the State of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands made an entry to the record regarding this incident, and also when he called upon the mayor about the situation. The mayor claimed it was common practice to arrest both African Americans and white people for what he termed vagrancy."," These were not the only three men local police detained after the Civil War. There were many instances in which local authorities attempted to undermine the Bureau's attempts at racial reform. Between 1865 and 1868, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution were passed. They granted African Americans freedom from slavery, citizenship rights, and the right to vote, respectively. In Mississippi, the state set about registering black voters, and the new state legislature even included some African American members. However, the Mississippi Black Code of 1865 vigorously sought to control the former slaves. Passed by former slave owners, it provided that blacks had to have special licenses if they were not regularly employed. The acts were used as justification for detaining the three men in Jefferson, County, because they did not have these special papers, and were thus subject to the fines and jailing that happened to many like them. "," The former slaveholders sought to control the newly freedmen in a legal fashion through these black codes. The formation of the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan, sought to force blacks to do certain things through the use of terror. The Klan first actively showed itself during the 1868 elections where they used violence and intimidation aimed at African Americans to deter them from the voting polls. Their hatred spread to black schools, teachers, and churches. The federal government stepped in with the Enforcement Act, which allowed that Klan members would be tried in federal and not local courts, but this had little effect on decreasing their activity. So, while attempts were made to give the newly freed blacks the rights they deserved, an underlying hatred still existed towards them from their former masters and other white southerners. Thus, the federal government's attempts for equality became futile because they were often undermined by civilians, particularly in Mississippi."],"display_date":"July 15, 1867","search_date":"1867-07-15","locations":[{"id":7098,"lat":31.7342121703,"lng":-91.0371521217,"zoom":10,"place":"JEFFERSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2164,"title":"Problematic Labor Contracts\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-17","end_date":"1868-11-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the Civil War ended in 1865, hundreds of thousands of enslaved people suddenly found themselves without an owner. With very little money or land of their own, they were often unsure of how or where to proceed next. A system of sharecropping thus evolved where the newly freedmen rented tracts of land from landowners and were expecting to give the landowners a portion of the profits made from the crops harvested on that land. Labor contracts were then signed arranging the details of what was expected of the freedmen and of the landowner.","On February 17, 1865, newly freed Henry Kanes, signed a contract with Chandler Sueham in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The contract allotted that Sueham, the landowner, would provide Kanes with the land and tools necessary to produce a crop, and in return, Kanes was to attend to Sueham's flock (no specific animal stated), as well as pay Sueham back one-third of the profits he gleaned from the land. Contracts like this led to discontent between the sharecroppers and landowners because they often felt like the other was not holding up their end of the bargain. Disputes arose because of beliefs that perhaps the sharecropper was not working hard enough, or that the landowner was not providing what was agreed upon in the signed contract. The Assistant Commissioner for the state of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land, reported to General O.O. Howard on November 28, 1868, that there had been many complaints filed recently about these labor contracts. The problems reported were specifically prompted by an upcoming election for delegates to the state convention that had impelled many freedmen to leave their work for the purpose of attending meetings held by political aspirants. The landowners from the Mississippi delta region were particularly unhappy because the laborers had missed several prime harvest days for the meetings, and they felt that the crops had thus faltered. "," Instances like these led to the precarious situation that Mississippi found itself in after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The majority of the newly freed people were generally unable to use what little savings they might have had to buy land of their own. Thus, they once again found themselves having to answer to a superior, who was normally a white man. The sharecropping system, originally intended to help the freed people on their way towards full independence had thus began to resemble the system of slavery that had prevailed for so long before it. The labor contracts were usually heavily weighted in favor of the white landowner, and the wages earned by the sharecroppers were so low that black women and children found themselves having to work so the family could survive. Women usually kept house for white families, and children engaged in seasonal field labor. Thus, emancipation did not eliminate the need for large amounts of labor in the South, and the labor contracts that resulted only slightly increased freedmen's control over their situation. In places like the Mississippi Delta, entire freed families found themselves working in order to make ends meet. Labor contracts gave the newly freedmen some sense of independence from white masters, but the conflicts that arose from the differing opinions of the laborers and landowners led to discontent among the majority of southerners dealing with the system of sharecropping."],"display_date":"February 17, 1865 - November 28, 1868","search_date":"1867-01-08","locations":[{"id":7123,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2174,"title":"A Desperate Plea to the Whigs of Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-10-06","end_date":"1836-10-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The nomination of a candidate for president proved to be a trying issue in Augusta County in 1836.

He condemned the negativity of those Whigs who viewed the election of William Harrison as hopeless, stating that the strength of the Democratic Party resided in the fact that they displayed no such feelings of apathy towards their candidate.

One of the newspapers that circulated in Augusta County, the <em>Staunton Spectator</em>, commented on the results of the county's nomination for president. The Spectator was certain that their nomination of William Harrison and John Tyler would receive a hearty response from the county, triggering a patriotic outburst of feeling worthy of Old Augusta, and worthy of the crisis. The newspaper praised Augustan citizens by saying that a vote for the Harrison/Tyler ballot was a vote for sound judgment, patriotism, and most notably, uniform obedience to the constitution and laws. ","The Whigs of Augusta County, Virginia knew, however, that the battle for the White House was far from over. They had to execute a strong national campaign in order to secure the victory. They did everything in their power to mobilize voters to support General William Harrison in his campaign for the presidency. Residents across Augusta worked together towards this common goal. One William Kinney of Staunton wrote to Newton Steele in another part of Augusta County regarding a club they had formed to help Harrison gain support. They called it the Tippacanoe Club after the nickname General Harrison had earned due to his victory over the American Indians in the Battle of Tippacanoe in 1811. Kinney enclosed club membership papers in his letter to Steele, asking him to mobilize the Whigs in his region of Augusta and to recruit as many people as possible to join their club. Kinney stressed the urgency of their purpose, writing, we ought to be active in getting every man we can to join [our club] before they can join them... He furthermore expressed his satisfaction in the effectiveness of their club, believing it to be the most powerful and effective means of promoting General Harrison...","The Spectator's mention of obedience to the constitution and laws obviously implied the Augustans' beliefs that, with Harrison and Tyler in the White House, the institution of slavery would be preserved, an imperative issue to the county's Whig majority, and most likely the crisis to which the article refers. Whigs viewed the practice of slavery as their constitutional right. Their faith in Harrison resided in the fact that he had sided with the South during the Missouri crisis, and that he openly denounced abolition.

G. Nicholas informing him that he had been nominated and accepted as Com[missioner] for settling claims to reservations under the Choctaw Treaty.  As a prominent gentleman from a well-established Virginian family, Randolph was a natural choice for the position except that the Choctaw Indian tribe lived in Mississippi, far removed from his native state of Virginia.  By the 1830s Virginia no longer had internal incidents with Indians because the nation's frontier lines had expanded and pushed tribes farther west.  But even residents of Albemarle County would have been very interested in the future of the Indians because these tribes lived on very precious land within the South's cotton economy.  ","Although the Choctaw tribe had recently earned distinction in the War of 1812 and had been declared the perpetual friend of America on October 24, 1816, when Mississippi became a state in 1817 the Choctaw Indians threatened the American identity of the new state.  They not only proved a problem for settlers wishing to move to the frontier, but moreover, by continuing to act as an independent nation within the United States, the Choctaws threatened the authority of the Mississippi state government. Grateful for the stability and unity of their own community, Albemarle County residents and other southerners would have expressed concern that the Choctaws posed an obstacle to greater prosperity of the South.  For this reason, political leaders throughout the 1820s and 1830s searched for ways to push the Choctaw westward onto territorial lands that were not officially part of the United States. ","In September of 1830, Andrew Jackson's administration finally concluded the treaty referred to by Nicholas as the Choctaw Treaty. Officially known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the treaty removed the Choctaw Indians west of the Mississippi River and claimed all lands east of the river as the property of the United States.  But Article 14 of the treaty decreed that if any Choctaw Indian agreed to become a citizen of the United States, the U.S. government promised to give them a parcel of land on which they might live and farm.  Nicholas' letter alerted Randolph that he had been nominated to assign these pieces of land to those Choctaws who chose to remain. In presenting him with all of the particulars of the position, Nicholas informed Randolph that his pay would be three thousands dollars a year and that though there would be little personal risk involved the position would require ten or twelve months of his time.  But overall his letter drips of resentment towards the Indians who tried to remain in Mississippi because he considered it a cowardly last attempt to avoid removal.  His bitterness was obvious when he commented to Randolph that, if he accepted the position, his job would require him to assist some of the greatest scoundrels in the world. Nicholas doubted the sincerity of the Choctaw who had chosen to remain and suggested that he would be relived to hear that Randolph had declined accepting the appointment.","A week later, on March 14, 1837, Randolph received the official offer from R.B. Poinsett officially offering him the position of Commissioner to adjust claims to reserves of land under the fourteenth article of the treaty with the Choctaw Indians.  While there is no sign of Randolph's acceptance or refusal of the appointment within these two letters, as seen from Nicholas' letter, such a position would certainly have been debatable in southern society.  While some, like Nicholas, might have resented the Indians as a threat to the unity of the South, others would have defended the Choctaws' rights to the land and would have been grateful for the government's merciful offer to the Indians.  Thus, Randolph's appointment presented him with a quandary in the antebellum South as southerners struggled with their desire to expand and the existing Indian population."],"display_date":"March 8, 1837 - March 14, 1837","search_date":"1837-03-10","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2186,"title":"A Dinner Invitation to President Andrew Jackson\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-02-28","end_date":"1837-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 28, 1837, almost a week before the inauguration of the new president Martin Van Buren, <em>The Globe</em>, a Washington D.C. newspaper, reflected upon the Presidency of Andrew Jackson and expressed the thanks of the nation for his service.  The newspaper editors found a supreme example of gratitude in the people of Albemarle County who had recently appointed a committee to invite the President to a public dinner in the town of Charlottesville on his return from the seat of Government to the Hermitage.  Although at this time Albemarle County's Whig constituency had gained a slight majority over the Democrats, Jackson's loyal supporters wanted to recognize the man who had gallantly defended the South and served the nation as president.  Despite the fact that Jackson politely declined the invitation based on his health, he took advantage of the people's display of loyalty to champion all that their party had accomplished in office and to defend the political spoils system that he had encouraged. Jackson also appealed to the people of Albemarle by praising the county as the great home of Thomas Jefferson - the man from whom he claimed to have imbibed the principles... [of his own] public labors.  Jackson wrote that it would have been his greatest triumph to have learned that Jefferson's closest neighbors had not found him lacking in the high office that he shared with such a great man.  <em>The Globe</em> manifested these sentiments to the entire country and distinguished Albemarle as a favored place of President Jackson regardless of the fact that the President could not attend the County's dinner. ","The Democrats of Albemarle accredited Jackson as a fighter, ever-triumphing over his adversaries in defense of the nation.  They assured the President that they regarded his services with the more pride and gratitude, when we remember the bitter and malignant opposition with which it has ever been your fortune to contend, from the misguided friends, and real enemies of our country, and the faction of disappointed rivals and defeated aspirants to the same high office you have held. As a renowned military leader in the War of 1812, a defender of the frontier from the Indians, and a politician, Jackson's tenacious spirit earned him respect in counties like Albemarle that had voted strongly for him in the presidential elections of 1828 and 1832.","In an effort to extend his own personal thanks for their loyal support, Albemarle Democrats and other Jacksonians across the South benefited from Jackson's system of rewarding his followers with political offices.  The Jacksonian Democrats of Albemarle County adamantly defended Jackson's spoils system by proclaiming, It was our pleasure, as it was our duty to our country then, to sustain you and your measures...regardless of the idle charges of 'man-worship, office-seeking, corruption and subserviency' heaped upon us, and of 'tyranny, usurpation, and despotism,' so liberally bestowed upon you.  Although this would have undoubtedly been a point of opposition Whigs in Albemarle and across the South, the President defended the system not as a form of favoritism but as a moral and honest duty.  In Jackson's opinion such a system engendered loyalty and eradicated corruption in the government.  ","By the end of Jackson's second term, however, the South was no longer as united behind his administration.  William G. Shade concludes that his stand against nullification and his assertion of the Executive branch over the power of the individual states caused many southerners to voice discontent and turn their support to the Whig party.  In fact, Albemarle and other eastern counties of Virginia had voted pro-nullification because they wanted to defend the states' individual right to interpret the Constitution from the power of the national Executive branch.  Michael F. Holt maintains that this threat to state power was a prevalent concern in the South because of the greater degree to which state governments tangibly affected people's everyday lives.  Therefore, by the end of Jackson's second term in office, southerners were grateful for his sacrifices on behalf of the nation but many were ready for a new administration."],"display_date":"February 28, 1837","search_date":"1837-02-28","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2187,"title":"Courtroom Drama in Black and White at Cumberland Court\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-09-02","end_date":"1834-09-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a long day of riding through the rain to Cumberland Court, Carter H. Harrison sat down to record the exciting events of the day in his diary and proudly declared, I defended and cleared a negro charged with an attempt to kill by poisoning.  Although Harrison records no further details of the proceedings, this account of September 2, 1834 reflects daily life of the local court system in the South - a realm in which blacks and whites met frequently.          ","While it is unclear whether the negro of Harrison's story was a free black or a slave, both parties commonly appeared in court and both were subjected to a legal system ruled by white men.  Surprisingly however, these white men did not always champion racial prejudice in their role as jurors.  In rural counties of Virginia similar to Albemarle, Melvin Ely notes that often times white juries had personal contact with those involved in the cases and thus, jurors tended to judge them as individuals whom they knew, not as appendages of that abstract, aggregate free black category against which legislator and editorialists aimed racist laws and rhetoric. The court juries thus ironically treated free blacks similarly to other free white men of similar social and economic standing; Ely comments on this unforeseen pattern by remarking a slaves' status as a free man, more than his color or previous condition, governed his treatment by the legal system.  The Virginia courts therefore affirmed the free black man's status in society as higher than that of a slave but failed to record exactly how he should be treated; thus, for many years, free blacks enjoyed moderate courtroom equality based on their undefined role in society and were able to benefit economically from their freedom.","If the negro that Harrison acquitted were a slave, that individual was very fortunate because slaves, in contrast to free blacks, lived in a brutal system of dominance and submission that also transcended the legal system.  Courts in rural, agrarian counties such as Albemarle had little sympathy for slaves who committed crimes against their white masters or neighbors and often issued harsh punishments such as death or exile. The courts did however, try to protect slaves who experienced excessive violence at the hands of their masters but juries hesitated to legally ascribe a slave's death to a beating for fear it would jeopardize the owner's dominance over a slave.  Therefore, courts extended minimal protection to slaves but were always mindful of their primary duty to protect the dominance of the white man and his property.  ","Often times Virginian slaves were made to appear before a called court - a court-like panel specially designed to hear slaves' cases within ten days of their apprehension. Five men sat on this panel and had the power to determine guilt and fix a permanent sentence that could not be appealed.  But the slaves were not helpless in these courts because the panel provided them with a defense attorney and required a unanimous decision in order to convict.  If a defense attorney could not be contracted before the trial, the panel postponed the date because it wanted to reach a fair decision. Although defense attorneys were often assigned minutes before the trial, they often times reduced the charges and could even exonerate the slave.  In 1832, a new Virginian law expanded the jurisdiction of the called courts to include free blacks' cases as well so the negro that Harrison defended could have been a free black or slave whose trial may have also occurred before this type of panel-court.","In his diary, Harrison expressed some disgust at the thought of having to defend people below him when he reflected upon his reasons for never seriously pursuing law as a profession.  He explained that the profession had rendered [itself] odious...by too close a contact with the vicious and illiterate classes of society.  Therefore, although he successfully acquitted a black man in court, by 1834 whites like Harrison challenged the black man's privileges because of his inherently inferior nature. But despite these existing tensions, the courtroom was ultimately a place where blacks could attempt to protect their dignity as well as a realm in which black and white interacted together, albeit unequally."],"display_date":"September 2, 1834","search_date":"1834-09-02","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2190,"title":"President Martin Van Buren&#39;s Independent Treasury Sparks Controversy within the Democratic Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-12-12","end_date":"1840-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the year of 1840 drew to an end, the residents of Albemarle County prayed that the new year would finally bring relief and economic stability to the nation still recovering from the Panic of 1837.  President Martin Van Buren echoed these sentiments in his speech to the second session of the Twenty-sixth Congress concerning the general state of the nation.  As almost half of the speech discussed the economic state of the country, the editors of <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> determined that it was important enough to publish the speech in its entirety on December 12, 1840.  Although Van Buren mentioned several other pressing issues, his main objective was to address the financial future of the nation and the recently confirmed Independent Treasury.  As he reviewed the catastrophic events that led up to the Panic of 1837, Van Buren assigned the crisis' blame to the national bank and the national debt, arguing that both were not merely unnecessary, but in direct and deadly hostility to the principles of [the people's] Government, and to their own permanent welfare.  Thus, Van Buren maintained that the best way to rectify the country's economy was to establish an independent organization to manage the government's funds, hence his creation of the Independent Treasury.  ","As James Roger Sharp has ascertained, Albemarle County only had a slight Whig majority at the time of this speech and thus, the newspaper article would have attracted intense political debate and discussion. At the time, the Democrats and Whigs of Virginia were both desperate to restore the state to its former prestige and influence in national politics; after Jackson refused to renew the Bank of the United States' charter in 1836 and the Panic of 1837, both parties separately hoped that they would solve the America's uncertain fiscal future. The Whigs fervently believed that a national bank was the only way to preserve economic unity and that, when held in check, the credit system was healthy for the economy. While the Whigs had remained united in their efforts to oppose Van Buren's Independent Treasury since its proposal in 1837, ironically, within the President's own party, it produced much more conflict.  In late 1835 a faction of conservative Virginian Democrats had emerged led by William C. Rives who, as historian James Sharp explains, condemned the exclusive use of hard money for the sale of public lands as impractical and the Independent Treasury as another utopian scheme - unfeasible and ineffective.  Although the Democrats managed to avoid a major split within the party they were anxious to maintain that party unity despite the controversial issue of the Independent Treasury. ","By the time of Van Buren's speech in 1840, the Virginian Democrats had regained many of their wandering conservatives but the debate over the economy had proved volatile enough to have successfully created an unforeseen impasse within the party. Liberal Democrats supported Van Buren's Independent Treasury because they had seen the results of wild speculation in the Panic of 1837 while conservative Democrats argued that if credit and inflation were carefully monitored, a system of state and local banks was more efficient.  Rives hoped to turn the Virginia Democratic party against Van Buren's administration but by 1838 it became clear that the majority of Virginia Democrats would not leave the national party, even after the proposal of the Independent Treasury. Slowly conservative Democrats despaired of changing the party's platform and completely lost heart when Rives did not win his bid for reelection to the Senate in 1839.  Most returned to the mainstream Democratic party and by 1840, the presence of the conservative Democrats in Virginia had disappeared.","<em>The Virginia Advocate</em> very astutely appealed to both the Whigs and the Democrats in Albemarle County by printing Van Buren's speech because the financial health of the nation was a mutual concern as both parties tried to resolve the issue.  Furthermore, since another presidential election was fast approaching, the political atmosphere intensified as southerners debated party platforms and the future course of the nation. Thus, Whig and Democrat alike in Albemarle County would have bought this paper and perused the president's speech with equal interest."],"display_date":"December 12, 1840","search_date":"1840-12-12","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2232,"title":"A Swindling Bookworm.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-09-03","end_date":"1897-12-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A man named William Mills Butler was arrested on September 3, 1896 in St. Louis, Missouri on the charge of mail fraud.

The headlines that ran in the New York Times that day took the opportunity to let lose a harsh critique on that particular Congress. They read: A DISGRACE TO AMERICA, FAITHLESS TO PARTY AND COUNTRY, and, NO ONE REGRETS THE DISSOLUTION. The prestigious newspaper commented on the corruption and ineptitude of the political leaders in the Congress. After discussing several missed opportunities that the Congress failed to take proper action on, the New York Times listed the worst offenders in several states. Arkansas, along with several other southern states, had eight of its representatives' names appear on this list including James K. Jones, James H. Berry, Philip D. McChulloch, Jr., John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, Willaim L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neil. Historian Dallas T. Herndon recorded each man's election to that disgraced Senate in 1922, The election for representatives in Congress was held on November 6, 1894. Those elected from the six districts in order were: P. D. McCulloch, John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, William L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neill, all Democrats."," The New York Times seemed to be specifically attacking the Congress for its democratic majority. It suggested that the South's overarching democratic political sympathies and politicians were responsible for the problematic congress, not the North: the performance of the Democratic majority, coming into complete control of the government, entrusted with the power to embody in the laws... responsible for the prudent management of affairs, has been so lame and impotent that it may be said without offending Democrats, that nothing in the life of the congress became it so much as its taking off. The paper went on to accuse Democrats of being, stupid and, ignorant in their being out of sympathy with the conservative president of the time, Grover Cleveland. Jones, specifically, was accused of being, a rather narrow, weak, gullible, man who had, an unmitigated aversion for anything that smacks of sound money or loyalty to the president. He was held accountable for swaying the congress with those notions. "," The paper reported glumly that his term did not expire until 1897. In fact, James K. Jones stayed far past 1897, even though his name appeared first for Arkansas on the list of Those Who Have Betrayed the People in the 1895 edition of the New York Times. Jones's continued political career suggests that the political tone against Arkansas Deomcrats was not as hostile toward the end of the 1890s. The six representatives of the congress for Arkansas were then listed in order as, McCulluch a bullion coiner, Little who was willing to pay gold loans in silver, McRae whowould starve the commission out of office, Terry who voted against the silver repeal, Dinsmore who has been all the objectionable things in legislation on finance, and Neil, a starver of the merit system."," Although political tensions between the North and South lessened from the height they had been during Civil War, it was not all together gone, particularly in government.

On the back of the keepsake photograph, someone had scribbled Cluster Springs High School Baseball Team, over the words Cluster Springs Academy. The photograph dates back to the turn of the century, around 1900, when secondary education began to change in the United States, specifically in the state of Virginia.","A pamphlet entitled <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> published in the beginning of the twentieth century told the story of a Virginia preparatory school located a half a mile from Cluster Springs on the Durham Division of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, approximately six miles from South Boston, Virginia. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> is a brochure that not only discussed the history of the Academy but also marked the school to potential students and their families. Many pages were devoted to discussing the benefits of the 150 wooded acres, the famous mineral springs, and the mild climate; the mild climate makes it possible for the students to indulge in some form of outdoor sport every week in the year. One page of the pamphlet was a testament to the school's athletics reputation especially in the sport of baseball where the record was one of the best among the preparatory schools in the state. In terms of academics, the pamphlet quoted that without any form of testing or examination 75 percent of students continued in schools of higher education. ","Virginia's education system was beginning to make several changes at the end of the nineteenth century including the growth of the secondary education system as a whole, the inclusion of specific educational requirements, and growth in attendance. For example by 1914, in some Virginia counties, such as Halifax County, there were as many as three public high school districts. At the end of the nineteenth century, there were also lists of recommended textbooks, courses, and subjects for public high schools published by several authors. Another important fact was the growth in attendance in secondary schools. Although the growth was not consistent from 1890 to 1900, the number of pupils increased from 9,124 to 11,736.

Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee.

J. Taylor Ellyson, the Chair of the Virginia State Democratic Committee, sat down with the Secretary, James R. Fisher, to write letters to the nominees. In Ellyson's September 4, 1893, letter to E.P. Buford, Esquire, he congratulated Buford on being chosen as the Committee's Canvasser for Brunswick County, Va. Ellyson affirmed his confidence in Buford's abilities and willingness and urges him to accept the position early in order to prepare for the contest.","Economically, the Panic of 1893 was one of the worst crises in the history of the United States. Although there was no consensus on the cause of the Panic, several different factors contributed, beginning around 1890. One of the important factors was a run on the gold supply, where people traded in their silver notes for gold notes. Since so many people traded in their silver notes, the U.S. Federal Reserve reached the minimum amount of gold required in their vaults and people could no longer trade in their silver notes. After this occurred, many banks failed, thus causing the price of silver to plummet. Once the banks failed many railroads (and then companies) in the West and Northwest followed suit and filed for bankruptcy. Thus, the estimates for the number of bank failures and companies reached approximately 500 and 15,000, respectively.","Politically, Americans blamed the Democrats and President Grover Cleveland for causing the Panic. Therefore, when it came time for elections, it was important for the Democratic Party to attempt to withstand the pressure and come out on top. The Virginia State Democratic Committee was looking for strong, respected community leaders to help get the votes within each individual county. This role of soliciting votes fell to the county Canvasser, and in the case of Brunswick County, the Committee chose E.P. Buford for the role. As an established lawyer within the town of Lawrenceville, Virginia, E.P. Buford was an excellent choice for the role because of his many connections within the town and surrounding community. He had many cases with different plaintiffs thus creating a large network and building a reputation within Brunswick County. This is exactly what the Democratic Party needed as it began to take heat for the policies that caused the Panic of 1893."],"display_date":"September 4, 1893","search_date":"1893-09-04","locations":[{"id":13681,"lat":36.7647849382,"lng":-77.8590149574,"zoom":9,"place":"BRUNSWICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2285,"title":"Southside Virginians in the Spanish American War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["July 31 - Pendleton, Charles - Harris Creek - Amherst County - Railroad Brakesman - 27 years of age - Single - 5'7.5 - 136 pounds - Chest Measurement 34 and 36.5 - Ruddy Complexion - Blue Eyed - Light Brown Hair - Accepted - Vaccinated was how the many Army documents read in the collection of James Dearing Fauntleroy.

These documents became important when the United States declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898.","Leading up to the war, the United States had a great deal of interest in purchasing Cuba because many Americans had invested in sugar plantations. In fact, by 1895 Americans had already invested approximately 50 million dollars in Cuba with the profits from trade being close to double that amount. President Grover Cleveland announced on June 12, 1895 that the United States was neutral, even as fervor for war increased in the United States. Spanish General Valeriano Weyler decided that insurgents in Cuba would be easier to control by the Spanish Army if they were located in the center of the Cuban island, so he enacted a policy of Reconcentration and then put the entire island under marital law. On December 7 of the same year, President Cleveland changed his decisions stating that the United States would become involved in the Cuban conflict if Spain failed to end the crisis.","After the explosion aboard the U.S.S. Maine on February 15, 1898, it looked as though the United States would definitely become involved in the conflict. On March 28, the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry determined that a mine caused the explosion on the U.S.S. Maine. Later that spring in April President McKinley ordered a blockade of Cuba just four days before declaring war on Spain. Once American troops landed in Cuba in June, the Marines captured Guantanamo Bay. The Mobilization Act of April 22 enabled approximately 190,000 regular Army members and volunteers to join the troops already in Cuba. After troops attacked from San Juan and in the San Juan port in early July, Spain signed an unconditional surrender agreement on July 16. A peace treaty signed between representatives of the United States and Spain on December 10, 1898 in Paris, France determined the independence of Cuba while ceding both Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States and allowing the purchase of the Philippines Island by the United States.","At the end of the war, the United States had invested 250 million in the war and lost 3,000 lives.

The convention consisted of a declaration of the opposition of the members to all caucuses, and a resolve not to make a nomination for any one for Congress. Five people were appointed to a committee who were to use all fair means to elect a representative to Congress. The news clip that reported on the two conventions also hinted at corruption within the party, saying that the five-man committee's task was to elect only a Whig Congressman who was also a political friend of Gen. Taylor. ","So it was that the September 15, 1847, issue of New Orleans' <em>The Daily Picayune </em>announced the outcome, and lack thereof, of the congressional district conventions of the Democratic and Whig parties in the Third Congressional District. In the 1830s, the Whig party enjoyed great local success among planters in Louisiana. Although Democrat Andrew Jackson won the state in the 1832 presidential election, the Democrats in general could not win local elections; in fact, Whigs controlled the legislature from 1838 to 1853. Much of this was based upon who could vote in 1830s Louisiana. The state had strict property requirements for voting; only those who were white and who paid state tax or purchased public land could vote, making it harder for poor farmers to meet property requirements. Poor farmers usually voted Democratic and rich planters, who owned their own property and paid taxes thus making up the majority of the voting base, usually voted Whig. They voted for the Whigs because the party portrayed themselves as the friends of the protective tariff on sugar and of the United States Bank, qualities that appealed to rich planters. The Democrats, on the other hand, were portrayed as the enemies of the institutions that planters valued and thus were not popular among the wealthy. There was some power shifting when the Democrats won the governor's mansion in 1842, but this was seen as a fluke caused by a banking scandal involving the Whig government, and the party remained a powerful force in Louisiana politics.","Things really changed after Louisiana's Constitutional Convention of 1845, when the new state constitution granted the state's citizens universal white manhood suffrage, dispensing with the previous property requirements. The next year Democrats, strengthened by the poorer farmers who till then had been unable to vote, again took the governor's mansion away from the Whigs, who had reclaimed it in 1844. The increase in suffrage was not the only thing that began to weaken the Whig party in Louisiana; sugar planters were having their own doubts about the Whig-supported war to claim Texas. They worried that Texas would become a competitive sugar market if it was allowed into the Union. Whig loyalty began to falter as voter turnout fell in 1848, and even though Whig candidate Zachary Taylor won the state, the victory is thought to owe more to Taylor's residence in the state than to Whig strength. Louisiana Whigs became even more disillusioned when national Whigs nominated a presidential candidate who was ambivalent on the Compromise of 1850. Louisiana voters began to seriously doubt the party, and by the 1850s a shift towards the Democrats became evident in the state. The 1852 election also signified the end of the national party. Disunity in the party had begun in 1848 when the issue of slavery split the party along North and South lines and the conflict intensified with the 1852 nomination. By 1855 most people had left the Whig Party in favor of either the Democrats or the Republicans. The ambivalence of the Third Congressional District demonstrates early uncertainty in the Whig party-a party that was beginning to die out in Louisiana and in the country."],"display_date":"September 15, 1847","search_date":"1847-09-15","locations":[{"id":5502,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2306,"title":"Farmer&#39;s Alliance as a Political Alliance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-02-06","end_date":"1883-02-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The threat of a trust formed between cigarette manufacturers in order to control the price of Bright Leaf tobacco grown in the North Carolina Piedmont greatly alarmed the members of the Farmer's Alliance living in the Bright Belt region of North Carolina where this tobacco was grown.

The Farmer's Alliance described itself as a non-political organization, yet beginning in the 1890's, the Alliance became more and more involved in political lobbying such as the Bright Belt Alliance's fight against the tobacco trust, giving rise to the Populist movement with the formation of the People's Party, pulling members from both the Democratic and Republican parties who longed for the days of small-scale enterprise."],"display_date":"February 6, 1883","search_date":"1883-02-06","locations":[{"id":9474,"lat":36.3074066663,"lng":-78.5963440829,"zoom":9,"place":"GRANVILLE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2314,"title":"Kicked Out of Virginia?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While some slaves were able to gain their freedom in nineteenth century Virginia, they were often by law forced to leave the state shortly after their emancipation. Many went to the free states of Ohio or Pennsylvania. However, several petitions made by the residents of Loudoun County reveal that the newly freed blacks were often inclined to stay in Virginia. As the petitions disclose, they received both support and some resistance from their neighbors in Loudoun County.","In 1848, thirty-nine petitioners requested the help of the state legislature in permitting William Watson to remain in Virginia. Watson had been emancipated by his owner and had proved a man of good character, of industrious habits, charged with the support of large family. Additionally, the petition stated that Watson was a convenient and useful person to [the] community in the capacity of a day laborer. A similar petition, signed by 93 residents, was written in Leesburg in 1850, requesting that Harriet Cook, a free black, be permitted to live in the state. The document stated that she possessed a high character and was a valuable member of Society. The petitioners elaborated on her value to their lives when they explained that she provided laundry services to many in the town and her loss would be a great inconvenience.","Despite these petitions, not every citizen in Loudoun County supported the residence of William Watson and Harriet Cook. A 1850 petition asked that the two free blacks be removed from the county and that the law should serve as the remedy in such cases where it ought to be in the city and county courts. Twelve residents of the county put petition. As pointed out by the historian Joshua Rothman, Virginia law required free blacks emancipated after 1806 to leave the state permanently within one year of manumission, unless they received a petition from the state legislature. While some fought to keep their families together and retain the already mangled pieces of their lives, Rothman states others made the difficult move and left a state that didn't want them anymore. That didn't want them while they were free. As the above-mentioned petitions demonstrate, some freed slaves received help from their white neighbors in their fight to stay in the state. This situation reveals, that in race relations, whites did not act like whites were supposed to act and blacks did not act like blacks were supposed to act, when personal relationships complicated the idea of stark racial divides. However, while some in Loudoun County thought the presence of Billy Watson and Harriet Cook proved good, in fact somewhat essential, for community life, others thought it necessary that they leave."],"display_date":"1848 - 1850","search_date":"1849-07-01","locations":[{"id":14002,"lat":39.0907154711,"lng":-77.6357306744,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUDOUN, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2326,"title":"The Brutality of General Jackson in the First Seminole War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-01-01","end_date":"1818-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["John Woods, a boy of less than 18 years, was a member of General Andrew Jackson's army during the First Seminole War in Georgia and Florida. One morning during the war, Woods was standing guard as a picket. As the sun rose, one of his fellow soldiers kindly offered to fill his post, while the hungry Woods made breakfast for himself. While he was cooking, an officer approached him and asked him to help with the removal of trash and animal bones from the encampment. After politely declining, saying he was standing picket, the officer proceeded to vociferously curse the boy out, drawing the attention of many in the camp, including General Jackson. The temperamental General ordered for ten balls to be blown through the d----d rascal. When none of the soldiers would comply with this order, Jackson court marshaled the boy on charges of mutiny and desertion, found him guilty, and sentenced him to be shot.","Soon after the end of the war, the United States Senate, prompted by rumors of multiple events like the death of Woods, launched an investigation into the conduct of General Jackson during the First Seminole War. Abner Lacock, a member of the investigation panel, personally came to the conclusion that General Jackson had an innate love of 'blood and carnage' and felt the need to tell the nation about his misconduct. Lacock authored A Letter to the People of Pennsylvania detailing General Jackson's misconduct. In this letter, he narrates the events leading up to the death of Woods, among others, and claims that Jackson deliberately lied time and again to explain his brutal and unwarranted actions.","The First Seminole War was conducted on one of the frontiers of America, and one that was characterized by nearly constant violence. It was a war easily won, but with questionable goals. The end result was the sale of Florida to the United States, a result to which the United States denied aspiring; rather, Secretary of War Calhoun sent General Jackson to Fort Scott in 1818 to wage war on the Seminoles as retribution for attacks against whites-soldiers and civilians alike-in retaliation for General Gaines' sacking of an Indian town.

Travelers relied on local people along these western routes to help provide them with necessary equipment and foodstuffs they needed on their journeys. Looking to capitalize on the growing market, Fleming Wood and his partner Egbert Harris hoped to establish a trading post in the area bordering the boundary line between the military base of Fort Smith, Arkansas and the Choctaw tribe of the Cherokee Nation. "," However, volatile relations that existed in Arkansas and throughout the South between whites and Native Americans stood in the way of simple establishment of a trading post. This was largely from exploitation felt by the Native Americans forced onto reservations and the cultural devastation caused by the white trade of vices such as alcohol. To help ameliorate these problems, the U.S. government created intercourse laws to regulate trade among the two groups. To work within these laws, Wood and Harris enlisted the help of M. Stokes, a lawyer for the Cherokee Nation; with his help, the traders obtained a trading license. "," Yet their luck as traders turned on September 9, 1837. Captain William Armstrong, the acting supervisor of the Western Territory, revoked their license and claimed that the traders had become among the largest whiskey dealers on the line. Though legalized sale of alcohol in Arkansas to whites was commonplace, the spirits sold by Wood and Harris' in their trading post broke the intercourse law because it created direct mercantile competition with the Cherokee Nation. In the interests of both governments, Armstrong also ordered his men to seize remaining goods in the post in order to keep the Indians from visiting the line as much as possible, [and] to prevent the introduction of liquor into the Indian country, and other violations of law. "," Angered by their loss of property and sales in the post, on December 12, 1838, Wood and Harris appealed the revocation of their license. The already volatile relations between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation intensified. Almost simultaneous with the appeal, U.S. government officials forced Cherokees off tribal lands during the Trail of Tears. Years of abuse, killing and enslavement of Native American populations ensued, and created juxtaposition to events in the Fleming Woods case that occurred over the course of the next three years. The Cherokee Nation, U.S. government, and the two traders discussed the issue of licensure and seizure of goods in a major review of the Indian Affairs policies. A turning point in U.S. governmental policy, the Fleming Woods case forced U.S. officials to recognize a greater Native American autonomy even in the face of their actions in forced relocation.

Mitchill was the executive chair of Georgia in 1817, but in early March of that year, he resigned his post. In July of that year, he met with the leaders of the Creek Nation at Fort Hawkins. His goal of this meeting was to explain to the Indians their role in creating and maintaining a mutual peace between the Indians and the United States. He warned the Creeks that other Americans had approached some of the Creeks in the southern portion of the nation, misleading them and bribing them away from the rest of their nation. He named, most notably, the British Agent Colonel Nichols, and cited the gifts given to some of these Creeks as evidence of corruption. Mitchill argued that the northern Creeks had a duty to bring those who had been led astray back into the nation, as tensions were slowly but steadily arising between them and the United States. Mitchill also stated that the United States would fulfill all of their promises to the Creek nation, as well as willingly renewing diplomatic relations with all of the southern Creeks who could be persuaded by their northern counterparts to return their previous amicable relations with the United States. In his testimony to the United States Senate on the First Seminole War, Mitchell did not state the final results of these talks; he implied, however, that the Creeks acquiesced to his requests. On August 4, 1817, Major Twiggs, stationed at Fort Scott, Georgia, wrote Mitchill on behalf of the chiefs of three Seminole towns in Florida. These three chiefs, via Major Twiggs, asked Mitchill if they too might agree to the terms he offered to the Creeks at Fort Hawkins. Mitchill planned to send for these three men, one of whom was Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town, to discuss their request. Before he could, however, General Gaines attacked and burned Fowl Town, thus instigating the violent retaliatory attacks of the Seminoles against the whites in the area that would mark the commencement of the First Seminole War and prompt Secretary of War Calhoun to dispatch General Andrew Jackson to Fort Scott.","One of the major problems in the process of creating and signing treaties between the United States and the Indians before 1830, when the Indian Removal Act was passed, was a lack of a central, sole authority for either side. The United States had multiple people, ranging from military officials like General Andrew Jackson to statesmen like Mitchell to independent citizens making a variety of agreements with the Indians. The Indians as well, and the Seminoles in particular, lacked a central government. Each town or group of Seminoles was organized independently, thus making it nearly impossible for the government of the United States to make a universal treaty. In addition, even if the United States succeed in writing and passing a treaty with a number of Indian leaders, as it did with the Chickasaws in Mississippi, that did not necessarily protect the tribe from the intervention of the state in which it lived. In the case of the Chickasaws, Mississippi tried to extra-legally subvert the treaty signed by the United States and the Chickasaws in 1830 in order to impose state law onto the Indians. Upon receiving a plea from the Chickasaws, President Jackson paid them a visit, and told them that they essentially had no choice but to sign a new treaty with the United States agreeing to be relocated west of the Mississippi River. The United States repeatedly recanted on previous treaties it had made with numerous different tribes in order to advance its own territorial possessions.

He also had heard reports of Indians murdering whites in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. He was, in fact, sent down to Fort Scott because of Seminole retaliatory strikes against the United States in late 1817. General Jackson concluded that it was necessary for the United States to invade Spanish territory and forcibly take control of Pensacola, thereby dispersing (or killing) the Indians gathered there. On May 28, 1818, he did just that. He claimed, after the invasion, that his action stemmed in no way from a desire to extend the territorial limits of the United States but was instead a preventative measure against further Indian violence against whites. ","General Jackson issued a statement regarding his taking of Pensacola that was then published in at least one newspaper; <em>The Times</em> printed his statement on August 3, 1818. His report also included details of his plans for occupying the city. He stated that all Spanish laws, so far as they effect personal rights and property would remain in effect. ","This ultimately became a moot point, as Spain agreed to cede the Florida Territory to the United States on February 22, 1819, although the treaty legalizing this sale, the Adam-Onis Treaty, was not ratified until 1821. The United States, in return, agreed to assume 5 million worth of Spain's debt. The taking of Pensacola and General Jackson's statement of intent, however, are still important. The atrocities that the Indians committed against white settlers in the Deep South deeply upset General Jackson. He justified all of his actions against the Indians in the First Seminole War on the perpetration of these 'atrocities'-even the ones that were provoked by General Gaines' actions. The Indians were occupying valuable land and reacting violently when the Americans tried to coerce these lands from them. ","The ultimate realization of General Jackson's antipathy towards the Indians was realized with his signing, as President, of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. With the passage and later implementation for this act, Jackson claimed repeatedly that this was for the good of the Indians, rather than for the Americans. He stated to Congress and to the Indians that the purpose of the act was to enable the Indians to preserve their culture from assimilation into white culture, and to give them the space necessary to govern themselves free from the American legal system. Regardless of his intentions, the result remains the same. President Jackson was almost solely responsible for the uprooting of North America's oldest human inhabitants and for one of the most egregious violations of the Constitution in American history. This act was written by his supporters and signed by him; rather than simply mandating the removal of the Indians, however, it authorized the President make voluntary treaties with the Indians exchanging their current land for land west of the Mississippi River. In other words, this treaty required that President Jackson to keep up his facade of removing the Indians in their best interest in order to sell them on his plan.","The Seminoles in Florida were, ironically, one of the last tribes to be officially effected by President Jackson's decision to remove the Indians west. They were also one of the most determined to resist this relocation, eventually forcing the United States into the Second Seminole War. Upon losing the war, all but about one quarter of the Seminoles were relocated.

As the end of the First Seminole War was in sight, this was not something General Jackson could allow to happen. So he approached the commander of Fort St. Marks and asked for his surrender to the United States instead of passing the fort on to Seminole control at the end of the war. Despite extensive negotiations, the Spanish commander decided to turn the fort over to the Indians, much to General Jackson's dismay. He refused to passively accept this outcome, however, and invaded the fort, replacing the Spanish flag with that of the United States without any resistance from the Spaniards. ","Part of General Jackson's animosity and distrust towards the Spanish was proven by the discovery of documents in the fort that detailed the transfer of arms and ammunition to the Seminoles. It was these arms that were used against his soldiers and the citizens of his country. The alliance between the Spanish and the Florida Seminoles was no secret, but the capture of Fort St. Marks provided concrete evidence as to this alliance. In addition to these documents, the American troops also found evidence that the Indians had been in the fort and that the chief of the Seminoles had met with the Spanish leaders in the private quarters of the commanding officer of the fort. There were goods clearly received via trade with the Seminoles stockpiled, including some that the Indians had stolen from American settlers. General Jackson subsequently blamed the Spanish for perpetuating the conflict between the Americans and the Indians in Florida. ","Prior to this discovery, however, both the Spanish and the United States maintained a public facade of being in a war together against the Seminoles, and the Spanish commanders in Florida denied giving any aid to the Seminoles in letter correspondence with American officers. In reality, the Seminoles had been allied with the Spanish since 1812, when the Spanish governor sent messages to the Seminole chiefs claiming that the United States would commandeer their land if they allied with it. He also offered a 1,000 reward for the scalp of John McIntosh, an Indian officer in the United States Army, and a 10 reward for one of any other United States-allied soldier or Indian."],"display_date":"May 1, 1818 - May 30, 1818","search_date":"1818-05-15","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2333,"title":"A Defense of General Jackson&#39;s Invasion of Pensacola\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-04-19","end_date":"1819-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Upon hearing rumors that the Seminoles were gathering en masse in Pensacola, Florida, General Andrew Jackson and his army invaded and took control of the town, dispersing the Seminole gathering in the process. After the war, General Jackson faced much criticism for his actions in the war, both in the press and in a formal investigation conducted by the Senate; his seizure of Pensacola was not exempt from examination and criticism. ","In the face of this firestorm of words, <em>The Times</em> published an article from the National Intelligencer defending General Jackson's actions. This article, the goal of which was to explain General Jackson's logic in deciding to attack Pensacola to the public, was rife with what today would be understood as racist attitudes. If it [the seizure and occupation of Pensacola] saved the life of a single frontier settler, it was right. At the time, however, these attitudes represented one side of the norm. Indians were killing whites. Indians were in possession of valuable land. Indeed, it was their own economic prosperity in their trade with the British that attracted the attention and ultimate envy of the United States. Given these two facts, many Americans believed the U.S. Government had every right to relocate them to the west.","The other side of this debate, which emerged about a decade later during the firestorm surrounding the passage and implementation of the Indian Removal Act, was adamantly opposed to the removal of the Indians, regardless of the rationale behind it. Many Americans were outraged at the willingness of the Congress and the President to violate past treaties made with the Indians regarding land possession.

As 1823 turned to 1824, Neamathla was the head chief of the Seminole Nation. This would not last, however. By July, he had been removed by the United States because of growing tension between him and the governor of the Florida territory, William Duval. The Seminoles were now faced with the challenge of electing a new leader who would represent them well without inciting the anger of the United States.","There were two candidates going into the election. Micopany was the candidate favored by the Seminoles, while the Tallahassees and the Micasukies favored Tuko-see-mathly, also known as John Hicks. The election went off without a hitch, and John Hicks was elected as the new head chief of the Seminole Nation-a political union of the Seminoles, Micasukies, and Tallahassees. ","This nation would not last, however. Within a decade, the Seminoles would again be embroiled in a war with the United States. Prior to this war, however, the United States had already begun making inroads on relocating the Seminoles. On September 18, 1823, the United States and the Seminoles signed the Moultrie Creek Treaty. The terms of this treaty moved the Seminoles south onto a reservation. This mass move of 2,300 Seminoles was poorly planned and poorly executed by the United States, primarily because of its lack of knowledge of the territory. The land upon which the Seminoles were settling was poor in quality, which did not bode well for the future health of the community. Indeed, they were hit with food shortages and starvation in both 1825 and 1827 when poor harvests left them without sufficient food to feed themselves. Naturally, they began roaming beyond the borders of their reservation in search of food. The United States, however, did not like this one bit. It had put the Seminoles on a reservation for a reason-so they would not interfere with the American settlers in the territory. So, in 1827, the United States passed a law forbidding the Seminoles from crossing the boundaries of their reservation.","This restriction, like the election a few years before, that seemed so significant at the time, hardly mattered in the long run. In 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed, and by 1842, 4,420 of the 5,000 Seminoles who called Florida home had been relocated to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi."],"display_date":1824,"search_date":"1824-07-01","locations":[{"id":1281,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2347,"title":"Clement C.

Clay, a U.S. senator from Alabama, was in a feeling of intense anxiety concerning the upcoming election of 1841. Lewis, an Alabama representative, was getting rather annoyed. At Clay's request, Lewis finally sat down to write a letter on January 18, 1841, to Benjamin Fitzpatrick, his brother-in-law and wealthy planter living in Elmore County. Fitzpatrick had been recently nominated by the Democratic Party for governorship of Alabama.","Clay was anxious to talk with Fitzpatrick about his nomination and the election. Unlike Lewis, Clay believed that the prospects for the Democratic Party were cause for distress. The current President, Martin Van Buren, did not enjoy a very peaceful term. The Panic of 1837 burdened his office greatly, leading to an economic depression that was only exacerbated by crop failures and low cotton prices. Furthermore, he refused to annex Texas and opposed extending slavery into the territories, angering many southern Democrats. These issues weakened his chances of reelection. Lewis found a simple answer to this-the Democratic Party should just stay quiet and firm, holding off on any announcement of the Presidential candidate to prevent the resurgence of the same issues. As far as their opponent was concerned, he stated, The only struggle is the secret one going on among the Whigs.","Yet, Lewis was wrong. William Henry Harrison, the presidential candidate of the Whig party, was victorious in the final election. On a local state level, the Democratic Party still retained a strong hold in Alabama. This was because many slaveholders were able to associate abolitionist sentiments with Old Harrison. The electorate of Alabama chose the very popular Fitzpatrick and reelected Clay and Lewis to their respective positions. Nevertheless, the Whigs were not as weak as Lewis had imagined. According to James Volo, they brilliantly campaigned in the first modern political effort in history. Even though Van Buren won Alabama's electoral votes, the Democrats certainly had reason to worry on the national scale. Harrison won 234 of the electoral votes, with Van Buren only winning sixty. Lewis seemed calm and collected in the months preceding the election, blind to the future success of the Whig Party and the imminent split of the Democratic Party that would come only a decade later.

On that day, the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> ran an article detailing the preparations of Colonel Theodore Roosevelt's First Volunteer Regiment of Cavalry, formerly known as Teddy's Terrors, which would move out to Cuba later that week. There had been a delay in the organization of a third squadron as two hundred Indian Territory troops were late in arriving, but were expected to come the following day. Colonel Roosevelt was working with the troops and expressed his expectations that the troops would see victory in Cuba. Citizens had welcomed Roosevelt to the camp the night before by serenading him and he received cheers from camp visitors. With their successful training and the support of civilians as well as the government, Roosevelt and his Rough Riders would soon be ready to take on their assignment and leave their mark on the Spanish-American War.","The Spanish-American War, which took place in 1898 in an effort to free Cuba from Spanish rule, created a need in the U.S. government for more troops to supplement state militia in the overseas battle. A federal law passed in April created three regiments of volunteers in the western territories and states; President William McKinley was given the duty of selecting the commanding officers. The regiment which would go on to win the most fame, the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, was that led by Lt. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. Though the group, which was affectionately known as Teddy's Terrors and the Rough Riders, had a high concentration of westerners including outlaws and cowboys, it also had a large contingency of wealthy easterners and even Ivy League students.","The regiment was the first to land in Cuba, pushing back the Spanish forces, charging Kettle Hill and marching on Santiago de Cuba.

In less than sixty days the regiment had been raised, organized, armed, equipped, drilled, mounted, dismounted, kept for a fortnight on transports, and put through two victorious aggressive fights in a very difficult country, the loss in killed and wounded amounting to a quarter of those engaged, Roosevelt later wrote.

Finally two candidates had been selected-A.K. Davis was nominated for Lieutenant Governor, while James Hill was chosen to run for Secretary of State-and both men were African American.  This was a crucial decision for the Republican Party because each of these offices was extremely visible in the state of Mississippi.  Senator Alcorn, a prominent Mississippi politician, surprisingly declared that he was against the Republican ticket for reasons he did not immediately disclose.  He said that he would address the people of Mississippi the following evening at Representative Hall.  Upon dismissal of the session, the Republicans still had not decided who they would appoint to run for State Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Education.  ","       James Lusk Alcorn was elected as the first governor of the reconstructed state of Mississippi in 1969, and he later became a United States Senator.  Alcorn was an extremely wealthy white planter who had been against secession in 1861, and was elated when Mississippi rejoined the Union in 1969.  He was a huge proponent of African American involvement in politics; he wanted them to contribute ideas, candidates, and their votes as newly declared United States citizens.  There were many Mississippians, however, who were not complementary of this idea, a large number of them being Democrats.  Voicing the opinions of many Mississippians, one state newspaper claimed, Nigger voting, holding office and sitting in the jury box are all wrong, and against the sentiment of the country.  African Americans were often stereotyped as lazy, ignorant, and illiterate, and therefore totally incompetent as governing officials.  Alcorn became known as an enemy of the white race; his desires for racial legal equality were not only controversial, but the cause of intense hatred towards him.  ","       The resistance to change and the racist lens through which Mississippians tended to view politics made it difficult for a black man to hold office during Reconstruction.  The appointing of two black candidates for office in Mississippi, despite opposition, however, was not entirely uncommon.  When the remaining Radical Reconstruction governments were finally overthrown in 1877, approximately 2,000 African American men had held local, state, and federal public offices in the South, including a wide range of titles and duties.  This proves that the freedmen were able to overcome the obstacles that held them back and not only run for office, but frequently win the election.  Mississippi blacks who ran for office benefited from the fact that their state was over 50 percent African American in 1870; the concentration of African American populations made a major difference in the likelihood of election for black candidates.  A vast majority of the blacks who ran for public office in the lower South were on the Republican ticket, like A.K. Davis and James Hill.  These two pioneers of black political participation in Mississippi were among the many African Americans who fought for a voice in American Politics during the Reconstruction.

On the eve of the family's journey to visit relatives in Tennessee an abolition crew had invaded the Eppes's plantation. According to Fannie, Susan's older sister, some white men, who had no business about the place, had come in the night and hidden away. Susan wanted to know more but Fannie refused to say anything else about that night. Due to the uprising in that night, Dr. Eppes did not accompany the family on their trip. Instead, he remained at the family plantation to keep watch. It was not until three days later when Susan pretending to be asleep on a couch, learned more. Her mother and uncle, having not seen her in the study, began to discuss a letter just received from Dr. Eppes. The men in the abolition crew had been on horseback, and according to Dr. Eppes, would be severely dealt with if they returned. Susan's Uncle Daniel stated in a serious tone that these abolitionists are everywhere through the South. Sooner or later they will make trouble for us. It was at that moment that Susan cried out in a voice full of concern and curiosity, Oh, Uncle Daniel, please tell me all about it? However, before Susan could glean any more information on the subject Fannie escorted her to bed. ","By 1855 the possibility of a plantation raid by an abolitionist crew had become a real fear for many large slave owners throughout the south. This episode is a prime example how abolition groups were growing increasingly bolder in their actions across the South. Vanished were the days when only those in the upper South had to be wary of such people. Abolitionists by 1855 were venturing deeper south into such states as Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Rather than relying on mass mailing antislavery materials to plantation owners, abolitionists were penetrating the South seeking to directly aid slaves in escaping their masters. Encouragement for this kind of action was perpetuated by abolitionist orators like Gerrit Smith and Henry Highland Garnet. In his speeches Smith urged Northern abolitionist to go south and help them. Many Northerners agreed that helping slaves escape would play an important role in the attack and eventual crumbling of slavery. However, proslavery southern whites saw these rescues in a different light. While abolitionists saw slave owners as stealing slaves' very lives, slaveholders saw abolitionist crews as stealing their property. From the southern perspective slave rescues were an outlet of violent northern aggression against the peaceful South. Proslavery advocates saw northerners who participated in slave raids as vile fiends, emissaries of mischief and worse than thieves, robbers, or murderers. In response, whenever a slave rescuer was captured, agitated mobs would gather and insist that the captured parties be punished severely, whether legally or illegally. Outspoken southerners asserted that if northerners continued to interfere in the affairs of slave owners there would be violence. This increasing fear of abolitionist parties added to southern sectionalism further driving the country apart."],"display_date":"June 6, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-06","locations":[{"id":1395,"lat":30.4456509268,"lng":-84.292206157,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2372,"title":"Land Allegation Dispute in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-12-27","end_date":"1885-12-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alabama's Attorney General, while celebrating the Christmas season in his Gulf Coast home, received notice that he would need to institute a test suit as soon as possible in order to determine the title of government grated lands. In 1885, both timber businessmen and railroad executives repetitively brought cases to the Secretary of the Interior concerning the cutting of timber in certain areas of Alabama. These lands, amounting to some 200,000 acres of fertile soil and dense forests, were granted to the state in order to aid the construction of the Mobile and Girard Railroad in 1856. The Alabamians that wanted to cut timber on the lands claimed that the railroad had no valid title to the area because Mobile and Girard failed to abide by the terms upon which the land was given to them. The Secretary requested that the Attorney General get right to work because the conflict between these two interest groups had been steadily growing, and the state government needed to make a finite decision concerning the issue so as to pacify the competitors for the land usage.","A case of a land controversy such as this would have been common in the late nineteenth century as railroads were becoming an increasingly important means of transportation and focus of development. In 1881, Alabama formed a railroad commission to deal with issues such as land allotment for the building of railroads. The commission helped to organize and solve many problems with the railroads development, but they also created problems with citizens, such as the conflict with the timber producers.<em>The Mobile Register </em>frequently featured articles and commentaries against the commission, saying that from everywhere arose the cry of an oppressed people against the arbitrary rule of the great railroad corporations. Therefore, like the timber producers in 1885, many citizens of the Gulf Coast area felt that the railroad companies had unfair privileges and took advantage of the state, and frequently opposed the development of more railroad funding and support in local and state government.

They held their wedding in the parlors of the Representative's home in Mobile, address  515 Thirteenth Street Northwest. The ceremony was done simply considering the two parties getting married; the bride wore a modest white toilette, with satin and lace trimmings, and her veil was decorated with orange blossoms. The couple had opted for a traditional Presbyterian ceremony, and they chose the chaplain of the Senate, Dr. J.J. Bullock, to marry them.

A few other Representatives, all close friends of Mr. Herndon, were also in attendance with their families. The bride was overwhelmed with the generosity of her guests, and was especially surprised by the beautiful embossed silver service that was hidden inside a magnificent casket-a gift from the Alabama delegation.

The impact was so severe that it killed four people and wounded forty to fifty people. The locomotive, caboose, express and baggage car, two passenger coaches, and one sleeping-car all burned down and creating 300,000 worth of damage. "," By the time of the train crash in1869, Tennessee railroads were dangerous because they were poorly kept. Historian Robert Corlew noted approximately 1,200 miles of railroads were built in Tennessee during the decade of the 1850s. They of course offered great potential for improvement and expansion of the state's economy when the Civil War came. The state of Tennessee invested a significant amount to build railroads all over Tennessee throughout the eighteenth century. Yet the damage from the Civil War was so detrimental to the railroad companies that after 1865 many of them could not continue construction. The state-aid system of Tennessee went into a debt of forty-three million dollars, much of which was attributed to their investments in railroads. "," Private railroad companies tried to pick up where state-aid funded companies left off. Their main focus was to connect the old railroad parts built before the war and form greater networks. Edward Ayers in remarks Throughout the 1870s and early 1880's Southern Railroad companies experimented with ways to accommodate themselves to the different widths of track between North and South Thus, the old and new railroad tracks built by various companies varied in size durability and reliability."," With such a high priority on connecting networks and small allotment of funding, companies sometimes overlooked the upkeep of the railroads. Even with the economy still in debt from railroad spending, Tennesseans still relied on the system. Consumers frequently used it overlooking the risks. Railroad companies prioritized the rapid networking of interstate transportation over safety. Few wanted to expend the time or money to inspect the durability of the tracks built before the war by other companies; all they wanted to do was connect them and get them up and running. "," Once they accomplished this, the railroads were very popular, despite the dangers. Southerners depended highly on railroads throughout the South for trade, commerce and rapid transportation. Private companies struggled to improve the economy building a network of train tracks as fast as they could.

Alabamians flocked to the poles to show their support for their party. The Democratic Party candidates in the county ran against candidates representing a fusion of the Greenback, Republican, and Independent Parties. Election poll officers excitedly reported that the majority of Mobile County voters were choosing the straight Democratic Party ticket, and accounts from the interior of the State reaffirmed the same information-the Democrats were in a clear lead. State officials told The Mobile Register that almost every county in Alabama had gone heavily Democratic as well. Numerical reports from Mobile polls also confirmed the party's victories. The lowest candidate on the Democratic ticket in Mobile County still had one thousand votes more than any Greenbacker or Republican candidate that ran for office-a huge feat for the Democrats Mobile citizens were, for the most part, overjoyed at their party's success, happy to be free from the radical control of the Republicans in their Gulf Coast town.","This swing towards the Democratic Party showed the presence of the old Solid South political climate-the traditional strong loyalty to the Democratic Party in Southern states. In Alabama at this time, the Democratic Party tended to be the party of planters and upper class white folk, whereas the Republican Party had a more racially diverse constituency and a wider range of types of candidates. The Republican and Greenback parties were much more likely to appoint a black to run for office than were the Democrats. Most whites in the Gulf Coast region were opposed to the Republicans' liberal agenda, wanting to return to their lawful superiority during the antebellum days. They certainly would not have wanted to support African Americans running for office, nor would they give their vote to Republican candidates who might potentially side with the Radical Reconstruction governments, further depriving them of their former security. Therefore, as the conservative Mobile population did in the elections of 1880, voters tended to support the more conservative states rights Democrats as opposed to the Yankee Republicans.","However, in coming years, this party alignment would begin to shift as the South evolved after Reconstruction and party lines shifted. This diversion from the Solid South was still a long way off still, and there would be many elections that paralleled the Mobile County local election results until that shift."],"display_date":"August 3, 1880","search_date":"1880-08-03","locations":[{"id":287,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2387,"title":"Angry Alabamians Protest Austrian&#39;s Governmental Position\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-11-12","end_date":"1881-11-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late 1881, writers for <em>The Mobile Register</em> were frustrated with the federal government, as were many citizens of the area. The newspaper's editor wrote that Strobach, an Austrian who had been appointed to oversee the Federal patronage of Alabama, should not be trusted to this office. The newspaper claimed that he came to the United States originally as hostler to Prince Salm-Salm. The writer adds, most likely as a suggestion to the President, that if the position is still available, Strobach ought to be blacking Arthur's boots, instead of naming men for Federal offices. Clearly Mobile citizens were not only uncomfortable with Strobach's appointed position, but they were angry and verbally hostile as well.","Mobile residents were not pleased with a foreign immigrant working in a government office that wielded power over their city. The prejudice against immigrants expressed in the local newspaper was not unusual in this time, nor has it been in any time in American history. In historical studies of American reactions towards foreign immigrants, sociologists have found that in the past there have been four primary stages of treatment towards the new Americans. First, people were curious about the new and different immigrants; next, they extended to them an economic welcome; the third stage was characterized by industrial and social antagonism; fourth, the Americans sought to harm the immigrants via legislation; in the fifth stage Americans displayed fair-play tendencies; finally, quiescence was achieved.","The influx of European immigrants in the nineteenth century undoubtedly triggered the onset of new forms of racism and cultural elitism, as evidenced by the Alabamians' attitudes towards the foreign official. Residents of the Gulf Coast would only have interacted with immigrants on an economic level, and therefore they were uncomfortable with Strobach's position of authority. Surprisingly, 18.7 percent of the mining work force in Alabama consisted of European immigrants. The Republicans of the state saw political advantages in importing laborers, whereas the Democrats wanted less dependence on black workers-thusly, immigration of Europeans was encouraged. However, the traditionally white-black dynamic in Alabama was not easily compatible with immigration influxes, resulting in racial and cultural stereotyping and discomfort. The Gulf Coast residents seemed to think that Strobach's European culture made him unfit for government duties, and they assumed his kind would be better suited for working low-pay jobs, like shoe-shining. Though seemingly cruel, the Mobile Register writers were simply displaying the discomfort that would have existed among a people who had only know immigrants in the capacity of mine and factory working. This stage of industrial and social antagonism is a natural phase of reaction to immigration, and the antagonism was most likely heightened by the South's already difficult race relation issues."],"display_date":"November 12, 1881","search_date":"1881-11-12","locations":[{"id":287,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2392,"title":"Texas Homestead Law and the Economic Depression of the 1890s\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1891-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From her ranch in Texas, Jane Maverick wrote that the early 1890s were sad years for families throughout the nation as the country was undergoing an economic depression. The depression started in the North, Maverick reflected, and worked its way down the coast, finally hitting Texas. Prior to this time, the country was undergoing a post-war boom and Maverick explained ...there had been a perfect orgie of speculation in everything and nearly every town was over built. Citizens were searching for a better life, coming up with plans to get rich quick. Many families were picking up and moving to cities. Why do people crowd themselves into great cities when there is so much beautiful land? she asked. Maverick blamed the nation's economic hardships on idleness and gambling on the part of the American people, adding that her husband was among those guilty people. When financial difficulties set in, her husband lost all of his land except for their house. All went but the big stone house, which that blessed homestead law of Texas saved, she wrote.","The Texas Homestead Law was based on a concept of exempting a house from seizure by creditors, and it originated in Texas in the early 1800s. Permanently established in the state's constitution in 1845, the law protected citizens from losing their houses to foreclosure due to debt which occurred frequently, especially for farmers, during the economic instability following Reconstruction. The Constitution of 1869 defined the rural homestead that was exempt as being less than 200 acres while an eligible urban homestead was viewed as a house worth less than 5,000. The Homestead law did not protect debtors who owed their money to the federal government.","The Homestead law saved many families, in addition to the Mavericks, from becoming homeless when economic hardships took their toll on the country. After the Civil War ended, the United States entered into a period of economic turbulence. This period was marked by great gain but also by the Panic of 1873, strikes by organized labor groups, and falling agricultural prices; all of these factors culminated in the economic depression of the 1890s. Nationally, economic problems are pinpointed as beginning in 1893 with conditions worsening through the rest of the year. Some recovery took place in 1898, but the economy was not fully restored until 1901 or 1902. This depression is considered to be the second only to the Great Depression in terms of severity. Perhaps hit hardest by the economic downfall were the southern and western states as 153 of the 158 national banks that failed during this period were in the South and West. During this time, the cotton textile industry was the only southern manufacturing industry to prosper. Farmers in this field still faced financial issues and the instability of cotton crops due to weather and fluctuating prices.","The economic hardships also exacerbated race relations in many areas. Poor white workers now frequently found themselves competing with blacks for the same jobs and for similarly low wages. This eroded the desired sense of white superiority and caused many bonds which had been formed across the color line to be strained or broken and increased distrust and feelings of ill will between the two groups. The economic depression manifested itself at economic, political, and personal levels across the country and led the country on slightly unsteady legs into the twentieth century."],"display_date":"1890 - 1891","search_date":"1890-12-31","locations":[{"id":12547,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"BEXAR, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2394,"title":"Public Education for African Americans in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-11-13","end_date":"1883-11-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of November 13, in Birmingham, Alabama, the United States Senate Sub-Committee on Education and Labor resumed session.

Next a black witness was asked to take the stand. James Hall, a wealthy African American planter, was summoned to Birmingham to give a testimony concerning the state of blacks in Mobile. James apprehensively approached the podium to make his speech, because what he had to report would please the committee, but it might arouse racist sentiments from his fellow Alabamians. He explained to the committee that he felt that the relations between blacks and whites in Mobile were improving at a steady rate, and he proudly shared that the children were attending school seven months out of the year.

The school aimed to enhance the labor skills of newly freed blacks. The state chartered 15,000 towards the school, but still needed more funds. The board of trustees purchased three hundred acres of land with an estimated worth of 2800 in yielded crops. Yet it did not yet have the bare essentials needed to function. Over 100 pupils attended the school, the rooms were not big enough to accommodate the students, and there were not enough farming instruments for the use of the school's manufacturing and mechanical branches. The board acknowledged Watkins's appeals and sent agents north to seek assistance and support. "," Seeking assistance in the North was necessary because support within their own state was not likely. After congress passed the fourteenth amendment granting citizenship to African Americans July of 1868, many Tennesseans became furious. Riots broke out. Radical conservatives established group aimed to terrorize African Americans called the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Robert Corlew reported that Troops were necessary to stop atrocious murders and numerous outrages which had been committed by violent and disloyal men. "," In response to such violent outcries, Congress worked fast to design the Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans survive among the chaos. They distributed food, supervised contracts, and established schools. This bureau offered government and abandoned land as a refuge and by December of 1968, already established the Manual Labor School in Rutherford, Tennessee. They created the school to help African Americans develop labor skills in order to function in society and intended to have enough classrooms as well as tools they could use for practice. Education was so popular among African Americans because they had never before had the opportunity to receive it. With such a large turnout of students, the original allotted funds for the school were not sufficient. "," Schools for African Americans in the South had trouble receiving sufficient funds because they were surrounded by so much opposition to their cause, yet the eagerness of African Americans to learn was the key to starting educational institutions. According to Stephen Hahn, the burdens of establishing and running schools fell chiefly to the freed people themselves. They had to pool their meager resources, rent or purchase a tract of land, build a schoolhouse, and hire a teacher. By 1867 African Americans composed about one-third of the teachers in freedman's schools, and was growing. Those dedicated to receiving more funds had to lobby to northerners for support. Republican leaders of the Freedman's bureau made great attempts to respond to the requests of the newly freed blacks, hoping to receive their votes once they learned about the voting process, but it was difficult because there just was not a lot of money to give.

Trail roads were rough, there were high rivers to cross, diseases to contend with, and of course the possibility of meeting up with Indians. Mary Maverick was making such a journey in the summer of 1837. She was traveling by wagon train from her home in Alabama to the new land of Texas. One day when her party was moving camp, 17 Tonkawa warriors surprised them. Still in war paint, the Indians greeted Maverick's party brandishing several pieces of human flesh. Maverick remembered the Indians coming up to her carriage and asking to see her baby. She denied the request and made sure to show the warriors her pistol and bowie knife. Maverick expressed annoyance when the 17 decided to ride along with the train instead of leave. The 17 Tonkawas did eventually quit the party much to the relief of Maverick. She was certain that had they gotten a hold of her baby, they would have eaten it. ","Meeting Indians was a regular occurrence as whites encroached more and more on tribal lands. The fear and aggravation Maverick experienced was common among settlers who encountered Indians. Maverick's fear that the Tonkawas might eat her baby was not completely unfounded. Tonkawa warriors did have a reputation for cannibalism. Accounts described warriors cutting off the hands and feet of their victims and then eating them. This, along with other obvious cultural differences and bad blood, made the two groups wary of each other. ","From the earliest days of Texas Stephen F. Austin anticipated conflict with Indians in the new settlements. In his first presidency (1836-1838), Sam Houston passed laws providing for frontier defense against both Mexicans and Indians. Houston wanted both protections for his people and to stay on friendly terms with Indian allies. There were, however, problems with the Indian land claims; the Texas government refused to recognize their legitimacy. When Mirabeau B. Lamar became the second president of the Republic of Texas in 1838, Indian tribes found him to be no friend of theirs. Lamar called for, an exterminating war on [Texas Indian] warriors; which will admit no compromise and have no termination except in their total extinction or total expulsion. Lamar wanted the Indians gone because he saw them as dangerous people and competitors for prime real estate. Lamar's attitudes mirrored those of the Texas people. Maverick was afraid of what the Tonkawas might do to her party and just wanted them to go away so that they could camp in peace.

Dirty and unshaven, his tattered, mismatched clothes belied his purpose. Much to the surprise of Sheridan, this raggedy character, whom Sheridan took for a vagabond, tried to sell him land. The man took offense at Sheridan's disbelief, but continued to push the sale of his land. After further questioning, Sheridan learned that the land, although in a good area of Texas, not only was not in cultivation, but also had not yet been cleared. ","Sheridan related this tale in his journal to show one of the problems that confronted a growing Texas: most of the land is in the possession of persons who do not possess a shilling & who consequently are unable to cultivate it. This was true because of the liberal land policy of Texas. The Texas Constitution of 1836 granted a league of land (4,428.4 acres) to heads of households and a labor of land (177 acres) to single men. Later the government also decided to give lands to veterans of the Texas Revolution and their families. With people owning large amounts of land, some who were poorer were unable to make use of all of it. Clearing land was time consuming, and if a man could not afford slaves to help him clear the land, it could easily go uncultivated.","A law of December 1837 produced another problem in Texas land policy. The law created land commissioners whose job was to give certificates to landowners allocating to them their legal amount of land. Once they had obtained their certificate, landowners had to have their land surveyed then approved by the land commission. Sam Houston had opposed this system because he said that it would open the door for fraudulent land certificates and claims to land, and he was right. There were many instances of fraud and shady dealing. The law also created a business for speculators. They would go out and locate the choicest land and obtain for themselves the certificate to this land, all before real settlers could move in. This left those in search of good land at the mercy of businessmen. Texas's generosity with land created opportunities both for eager settlers and slick speculators.

In the Governor's estimations, 500,000 North Carolinians would benefit from the railroad extension.

The State's remaining balance would be paid from the issuance of 30-year State bonds paying six percent per annum.

Graham, the third of four consecutive Whig North Carolina Governors, was continuing an era of progress with internal improvements that sought to solve the State's dire need for improved transportation.  Even among Southern states, where transportation greatly limited most states' economic horizons as compared to Northern states, North Carolina was considered backward.  Stephen Goldfarb explains the tardiness of Southern industrialization as a consequence of poor transportation to coastal ports.  Distances of one to two hundred miles between the fall lines of rivers and their coastal outlets, a feature of the North Carolina Piedmont, required the advent of railroads. The State's earlier attempts to organize a productive rail line between Wilmington and Raleigh remained a money-losing venture for the State.

Formal delegates to the convention were to be appointed by the governors of those states which held an interest in the cattle industry. The letter, which was signed by Wm. L. Black, chairman (and others), pointed out the government's inability to offer solutions or relief for the depressed condition of the cattle industry. Members of the cattle industry in Texas realized the deficiencies in the system could not be ameliorated without the united action of all those who had something at stake in the cattle industry. Specifically, the letter referenced the commercial problems the industry faced and the consequent desire for merchants and bankers to attend the convention and join the effort for improvement. Cattlemen were suffering as the industry lost money and it seemed that the little profit that did exist went into the hands of only a few. He asked the readers with this terrible depreciation in the value of our resources, it is any wonder that farmers are poor, and that the commercial industries of the West and Southwest are so paralyzed?","In response to the letter's appeal, delegates attended the convention on March 11, 12, and 13 of 1890. At the convention, delegates discussed the issues of the apparent railroad monopoly in shipping cattle and other challenges facing the industry. They also suggested measures that members of the cattle industry could take on their own accord, without having to wait on government action, to improve the current situation. Potential solutions included tariffs as well as an increase in the use of refrigerators and other actions which could reduce the immediate supply of beef and drive up prices.","Texas had long been a major player in the cattle industry; however, it was not until most of the Indian population was driven out of the area and barbed wire was developed that the industry was really able to operate in a systematic manner. Barbed wire, invented in 1874, made it possible for herds to be enclosed and for controlled breeding to take place. The new creation also ended the need for long cattle drives and helped put an end to Indian raids on the cattle. Indeed, the cattle boom existed to such a great extent that cattlemen often faced a problem of market saturation which drove down prices. Breeding was often moved to more northern states in an effort to spread out the supply. The delegates at the convention also pointed out that the invention of refrigeration provided one potential solution since it granted the ability to transport the meat to new markets before it spoiled.","As beef became a major food product, the national and international interest in cattle grew; this prompted the industry to transition from a market of individually-owned herds to a market of corporations, with investors based as far away as Europe. The development of closed range ranching altered the scene of the cattle industry and the Southwest as it grew in scope and productivity. The cattle industry eventually branched out to cover most of the United States, as evidenced by the fact that delegates at this particular convention represented such states as Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Colorado, Illinois and Wyoming. As the cattle industry became a major source of investment as well as an increasingly large source of meat products, it became a national and international interest and brought to light economic and agricultural issues that needed to be addressed."],"display_date":"March 11, 1890 - March 13, 1890","search_date":"1890-03-12","locations":[{"id":13232,"lat":32.7703945791,"lng":-97.2918801714,"zoom":9,"place":"TARRANT, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2428,"title":"A Murderous Education\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-01","end_date":"1846-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Around 1846, the students of Centenary College decided to take a stand.

As a result, those who could afford to employed tutors or took advantage of out-of-state boarding schools in order to educate their children, and those who could not used methods of home schooling. Clearly, problems plagues even the few schools Mississippi did have, and uncaring and criminal teachers like Jones certainly did not help solve these.

Outside events squelched any attempts to formalize education in the state. Although the University of Mississippi, a public university, was established in 1848, it soon had to shut down because of the Civil War. Finally, building on this idea of public education, Skates notes that, The constitution of 1868 mandated public schools for all children in the state, thus insuring the first statewide system of public education in Mississippi's history. Although a slow and arduous process, Mississippians were finally granted the same opportunities for education that existed elsewhere in the United States.

The <em>Raleigh Register</em> printed A Last Appeal for its readers to cast their votes for John Bell and Edward Everett in its final edition before the election.  Bell, whose motto the paper printed as <em>the Constitution must be maintained, the Union must be preserved, and the Laws must be enforced in all their integrity</em>, represented old Whigs of the South in the new Constitutional Union Party.  While the scope of the ensuing war that resulted during Lincoln's presidency was far greater than most could have anticipated, this last appeal to North Carolinian voters forebodingly warns of rupture that would lead to the now smiling fields barrowed by cannon balls, and manured with human blood and bones. The article considered that disunion for the current justifications would be modern humanity's greatest sin second only to the biblical original sin.  ","      The paper, eerily anticipating the prospect for Lincoln's victory in the election, made considerable effort to prepare its readers for the event of a Republican president.  An analogy to card games was made, such that if one begins a hand of cards and then finds the hand gone against him, he cannot honorably disengage but must respect his commitment to the other players and play it through.  Similarly, the article warned that North Carolinians must be willing to accept a Lincoln election just as they would expect Northerners to accept Bell's election.  This gesture of logic is considerable, as Lincoln did not even appear on North Carolinian ballots.  Furthermore, the article purported that factional grievances will be better resolved through Constitutional outlets than through disunion.  Finally, the article offered an assurance against disunion: millions of dollars of southern debt to northern creditors.  The pressures which manufacturers would bring to bear on Lincoln to maintain union, it was suggested, would suffice to dissuade the North from precipitating war.","Powerful forces lurked behind the political debates which confronted readers in North Carolina's Piedmont.  Despite optimism in the <em>Raleigh Register</em> that resolution of grievances could occur through constitutional outlets regardless of the election's outcome, retrospect affords the knowledge that this election functioned heavily in precipitating state secessions in the lower South.  Bell's emerging party, while firmly supporting slavery, nevertheless displayed the remarkable diversity in Southern politics leading up to the Spring of 1861.  Daniel Crofts, who has explored upper South unionists in the secession crisis, similarly challenges the conception that white Americans had segregated themselves into distinct and antagonistic factions of North and South during the late antebellum era.  Instead, the scenario during the election of 1860 appears to have included large numbers of Southerners who anticipated continuity of the Union and would have been astonished at the turn of events during the next five months."],"display_date":"November 6, 1860","search_date":"1860-11-06","locations":[{"id":9844,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2435,"title":"Republican Party Splits at Republican Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-09-01","end_date":"1870-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Just five years after the end of the Civil War, tension was already brewing within the majority Republican party of Missouri.  Because of the newly drafted Missouri Constitution of 1865, the term for the governor was reduced to two years and thus Governor Joseph McClurg was faced with having to win reelection in 1870.  A staunch protectionist and prohibitionist, Governor McClurg was strongly in favor of high tariffs, especially on liquor.   This stance made him unpopular with the more liberal wing of the Republican party.  Upon arriving at the Republican convention in late August 1870, B. Gratz Brown announced that he would come out of political retirement to be the liberal candidate on the ticket for the governorship.  It was predicted by the people attending the convention that should Governor McClurg successfully win enough votes to repeat as the Republican candidate for the governorship that Brown would run as an independent. "," A hot button issue at the Republican Convention was the re-enfranchisement of ex-Confederate leaders.  While many of the delegates supported full re-enfranchisement, Parrish states that some of the regular Republicans wanted to recognize the right of any member of the party to vote his honest convictions.  While this ground was considered neutral, the liberals refused to accept the language.  After an almost 100-vote margin decided to accept the amendments, 80 delegates from 35 counties left the hall and moved to the Senate chamber.  This action earned the delegates the nickname bolters.  Soon after the delegates bolted, more moderates began to join the bolters as further political compromises fell through at the convention.  The group created the new Liberal Republican party of Missouri and nominated B. Gratz Brown as their candidate for governor of Missouri.  To this news, the <em>New York Tribune </em>wrote that it hoped to report on the successful reelection of Governor McClurg.  Besides pushing for policy much more open to free trade than their former counterparts in the Republican party, the new Liberal Republican party established its platform as one that was in favor of re-enfranchisement of ex-Confederate leaders, a revenue tariff, civil service reform, and tax cuts.  After a closely contested race in November 1870, B. Gratz Brown and the Liberal Republicans were successfully able to upset incumbent Governor McClurg."],"display_date":"September 1870","search_date":"1870-09-15","locations":[{"id":7647,"lat":38.2610610866,"lng":-90.5377814277,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2443,"title":" Lunsford Lane Denied Extension of Residency\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-11-03","end_date":"1841-05-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A free man must go.  After three years of recommendations, petitions, and court proceedings, the Senate of the state of North Carolina denied Lunsford Lane extension on his residency in the state to allow more time to purchase his wife and seven children.  Lunsford had been commended and allowed by his employer, the Governor of the State, to remain employed in the Governor's office keeping order, running errands, and making deliveries, according to a letter sent to the Legislature.  The letter acknowledged that this would be against the North Carolina law that required free slaves to leave within twenty days of being warned out. In 1840, the Secretary to Governor Dudley wrote the first request for Lane's extenuating circumstances.  The letter was answered with no objection, but the situation was considered a legal matter, which resulted in Lane being summoned to court. Due to an unprepared prosecution team, the case was postponed for three months, which allowed Lane to negotiate a petition of relief to be signed by over twenty men and sent to the Legislature for evidence of his strength as a respectable, hard-working man.  When the Court finally met and his case was argued, Lane was not allowed in the Senate chamber because he was a colored man and waited in great fear and anticipation.  The members adjourned and harshly reported Well Lunsford, they have laid you out; the nigger bill is killed.  This was a cruel reality, laced with mockery from the white members of the Senate, and Lane claimed to have felt defeat at its worst and utter hopelessness in the face of humanity.  He was not only denied, but also banished from North Carolina, departing three days later on May 18, 1841, for New York City.What is significant about this narrative is the blurred definition of freedom in all-white institutions in the South.  The freedom granted to Lunsford Lane is an example of the restrictions placed on blacks even after they reached their ultimate goal of liberty.  Freedom was never really free, as historian Robert Fogel found in research of slaves and their owners.  The act of denying citizenship and any extended privileges were both absent from the lives of freed blacks in almost every state, which often left them still suffering from oppression in a white supremacist society, no matter what physical or mental state they were in.  In Lane's case, even though he was awarded freedom, his material conditions and life working for the Governor at least allowed him to be close to his family and earn a substantial living, which were not guaranteed with his freedom."],"display_date":"November 3, 1840 - May 18, 1841","search_date":"1841-02-08","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2445,"title":"Missouri&#39;s Third State Constitution Adopted\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-10-30","end_date":"1875-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For the second time in less than 10 years, Missouri had written a new State Constitution ","which was up for ratification by the citizens of the state.

Washington helped Lewis Adams, a former slave, make his dream a reality. The founding of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute ushered in a new era for African American education in Alabama and the nation. Booker T. Washington began his career the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, under General Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Washington's keen mind and brilliant thoughts got the attention of General Armstrong who begrudgingly mentioned Washington's abilities to George Campbell, a citizen of Tuskegee and president of the Board of Trustees at the Tuskegee Institute. Campbell, a former slave owner, was working through specifics with both Lewis Adams and State officials in Alabama to create an institute of higher learning and trade, primarily for African American pupils. Campbell sought the leadership of a strong black figure and found it in Washington.","The Institute was lucky to have many legislative allies. Two white senators, W.F. Foster and A.L. Brooks, were so enamored with the idea of the Tuskegee Institute that they sought to secure its future by acquiring state funding for the project. Foster and Brooks were able to urge the appropriation of two-thousand dollars worth of state funds for teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries were just the tip of the iceberg. The school lacked land, buildings and faculty members. When Washington arrived in Tuskegee in June of 1881, the Institute was extremely disorganized. In a mere month, in preparation for the grand opening, Washington managed to secure a single school building and several other necessities. Later Washington wrote in his journal, I opened the school...in an old church and a little shanty that was almost ready to fall down from decay.","It was evident that the only way to sustain the Tuskegee Institute was with more funding. Washington was forced to ask for every resource. He petitioned his friend Mr. Francis Chickering Briggs asking, My first great need is apparatus, such as maps writing-charts, globes. I thought by writing to you I might get a great many of these kid of thing which you would not miss there. He continued his quest, writing James Fowle Baldwin Marshall; Dear Friend: Please send me the addresses of some publishing houses where I can get my books at reduced rates. Over the years, Washington's fund-raising efforts paid off and the Tuskegee Institute, which opened its dilapidated doors to 37 students in July of 1881, grew significantly. At Washington's death in 1915, the Institute had 1,500 students, a two million dollar endowment, and instruction in forty trades, one-hundred fully-equipped buildings, and about 200 faculty members.","The founding of the Tuskegee Institute was important to blacks, not only in Alabama but also the South. The Institute provided an education in particular trades and this specialized education enabled blacks to better themselves and their socioeconomic status by providing employment opportunities in the wake of slavery and servitude. Blacks from all reaches of the South and even into the North traveled to Tuskegee to enroll and learn in an environment conducive to progressive race relations. Tolerance of education for blacks started to increase on July 4, 1881 and would continue to climb due to the addition of the Tuskegee Institute to the antebellum landscape of Alabama.

November 5, was a chance to right the wrongs of the election of 1870, only two years prior. The 1870 election included the race for secretary of state and James T. Rapier, born a free black in Florence, Alabama just thirty-three years prior, was on the ballot. Rapier became a prominent figure early in his life, participating in the National Negro Labor Convention (NNLC) and working as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessor among other involvements. It was not until Rapier became the first African American in Alabama history to run for a state office that his popularity nearly doubled. ","Despite his historic run, Rapier did not win the election of 1870. Klu Klux Klansmen, who, based on their beliefs, had obvious qualms with Rapier's attempt, intimidated voters with threats and violence. The Klan's interference made it nearly impossible for Rapier to garner support. Thankfully Rapier was neither discouraged nor fearful of the Klan. He courageously continued about his efforts in order to better situate himself for the 1872 midterm elections to follow. Rapier sought out allies in the black community in order to gain endorsements from any recognizable resource. He established himself as a republican and mounted an impressive campaign for Congress. His travels took him to nearly every area of Alabama. But, it was not until Election Day in 1872 that the fruits of his labor were realized.","Election Day was calm and peaceful. As hoped, blacks crowded the polls early in the day, showing their support for their fellow black citizen, James T. Rapier. Previous elections in Alabama had become violently protested, but the elections of November 5, 1872, proved to be perhaps the most tranquil in Alabama election history. Unhindered by interference and intimidation, nearly 70 seventy percent of the voter's turned out at the polls. As the totals were tallied, it was evident that Rapier would win, sweeping the Black Belt and carrying over one thousand white votes. Crucial to his victory was the fact that throughout his campaign James T. Rapier focused solely on planks in his party's platform. Rapier refused to discuss his race, citing it as a feature unique to him that would not negatively affect his leadership in Congress.","The election of 1872 proved to have a positive influence on racial opinions in the state of Alabama. Electing James T. Rapier to Congress sent a message to others in the South that repressing race was not the answer and no longer the norm. There were those in the South who still vehemently opposed the election of a black man to Congress. Despite opposition, it is important to realize the intense progress of the black race. Less than ten years prior to the election of James T. Rapier, blacks were enslaved pieces of disenfranchised property that counted as 3/5 of a citizen.

Railroads remained important for supplying goods to others for economic profit. However, poor track conditions often made for delayed trips and spoiled products. Train delays plagued the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. The A&C tracks were in horrible condition following the Civil War and in need of funding for improvements.","In conjunction with the endorsement law, the Alabama legislature found the necessary funds to reequip the railroad, restoring it to working order. However, what the state supplied was not nearly enough. Trustees and bondholders in the business incurred significant debt to be paid off over time to the state government of Alabama. Those related to the A&C began searching for land to acquire in hopes of eventually expanding the entire railroad system. Friends of the railroad system ironically enough were those who had a substantial strong hold on state politics in Alabama. Internal corruption commenced when these friends did political favors for the railroad. Fraudulent funding and land purchases orchestrated by insiders, trustees and bondholders were made by the thousands. With every false purchase came a false promise that led to deepening the debt of the railroad. The total debt, bonded and floating, amounted to nearly 11 million dollars. ","Unable to deal with the mounting debt, trustees called a meeting to discuss the future of the Alabama and Chattanooga railroad. Visibly shaken and incredibly nervous, the trustees conducted the meeting. Unbeknownst to them, this meeting would be their last. The content of the meeting foreshadowed the company's subsequent foreclosure a year later. Demands for payments on improvements and to employs could not be met. After intense deliberation, the trustees were forced to succumb to the U.S Circuit Court of appeals order and foreclose on their endeavor in order reimburse the federal government. The courts confirmed the sale of A&C citing its untimely liquidation and limited protection of property. ","Important in this foreclosure was the fact that the federal government intervened in a state project. The limits of state and federal involvements were not clearly defined. The A&C railroad foreclosure initiated conversations about the greater role of the federal government in private endeavors that affected the public. Reconstruction was an effort to solidify the nation while acknowledging the identity of the South. At the time, southern politics supported a lack of federal involvement in local and state affairs.

In October of 1879, Dr. Bryce, the superintendent, expanded his report, by including particular conditions and patient numbers, among other details. Averaging 400 patients, the hospital treated anything from pneumonia to cerebral softening to utter, indefinable insanity. The Hospital was neither gender nor racially divided. Of the 394 patients present in October of 1879, 208 were men, 186 women; 65 blacks and 329 whites. The Hospital received considerable amounts of state funding, nearly eighty-five thousand dollars in total. The funds were unrestricted and therefore used for anything from building improvements to employment benefits like free medication and services. The state not only offered funding but went so far as to appoint a special committee to examine causes of insanity, collect all pertinent information about practical ways to reform insane asylums and to ascertain details, expenses, etc. The committee's findings were positive. Officials called the care a labor of love for mankind. The committee also focused on defining particular deficiencies, namely, intemperance. Intemperance, deemed a disease by a panel of Alabama doctors, was said to have been acquired through multiple sources. Intemperance was most often contracted through habit and as the result of temptation put before the weak. The state of Alabama refused to take responsibility for those afflicted with intemperance. However, the committee returned suggesting that perhaps those infected with intemperance in the state of Alabama be secluded in a specific facility. The suggested facility would provide a place guarded from temptation and protected from danger. It would provide an environment to treat, cure and restore victims of intemperance to society. Interesting is that the symptoms of intemperance were never clearly outlined by the committee. Not to mention, the disease itself is found in no medical journals of the time. However, it is obvious through language analysis that intemperance is a condition of corruption which religious factions in Alabama sought to squash.  The question of intemperance is not nearly as alarming as the mention of the Insane Hospital in the first place. The disabled and disfigured were disregarded during the nineteenth century. People sequestered citizens with disabilities in insane asylums to distance themselves. That said, these asylums were rarely mentioned.

The American South explains that during Cleveland's presidency, his job included keeping the country united, especially because the Republicans and Democrats seemed to be at odds more so than normal. In addition, the pain of the Civil War remained strong in people's hearts. One way to unite everyone without politics was the reaffirmation of Thanksgiving Day's place in America.

Bibb received a letter from Dealia Ann Smith, a woman from Mineral City requesting help with her divorce case. According to William Cooper, divorce had become more common at this time than in the earlier part of the nineteenth century, however; it was still an anomaly of society. Whether or not Dealia Ann Smith was granted a divorce was not determined in the letter's contents, however, it would have been much easier for her to get a divorce during this time period in comparison to earlier parts of this the nineteenth-century. Changing of the laws helped ease the process of divorce. Earlier laws dictated that a private bill had to be passed by a state legislature in order to grant a divorce. Eventually, the law progressed to where it was easier to get a divorce. According to Cooper, cruelty, abandonment, adultery, impotence, and consanguinity were new grounds for divorce. Smith's husband had been gone for two years and during that time she had received no aid from him, and even while they were together he was still of no use to her. Smith claimed that everything he earned, while he was with her, he gave to his mother and left her with nothing. At the closing of the letter, she said that the last letter he wrote her told her not to write him anymore, thus blatantly implying that he wanted no further contact. Judging from the letter's contents, it was very likely that the state considered Smith's situation as abandonment and granted her divorce. ","The courts also became more sympathetic towards women in other aspects. For example, cruelty was an extremely loose term and often encompassed physical and mental cruelty and judges tended to be pretty lenient. However, a woman still had to prove beyond a doubt that she had not committed adultery, which denoted the archaic attitude that was still present towards women. Divorce also advanced women's rights. In the past, a woman surrendered many of her rights and property to her spouse once she got married; essentially, she possessed the same rights of children. Divorce empowered women to stand up for themselves in one aspect, however; it would be three decades before women received the ultimate symbol of equality in the United States, the right to vote in politics. So although divorce was usually seen in a negative light, in this case, Dealia Ann Smith and the other women who petitioned for divorce during this time were an indirect driving force and stepping-stone to more women's rights."],"display_date":"April 25, 1891","search_date":"1891-04-25","locations":[{"id":14015,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2477,"title":"Norfolk&#39;s New Water System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-01-01","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1856, the city of Norfolk, Virginia asked Wade Burnett, a civil engineer, to construct a plan that would improve the city's water supply system. In his report, Burnett noted the improvements that an efficient water system could have in the community. The townspeople of Norfolk would benefit in many aspects of life- domestic use, manufactures, extinguishment of fires, shipping, public baths, public fountains, street cleaning, and sewage. Burnett stressed the health and safety benefits of the new water system, as an abundant supply of clean water would not only aid in the prevention of fires, but also dramatically improve the overall health of the city and its citizens. Burnett divided his plan into five categories: the Receiving Reservoir, the Engines and Engine house, the Distributing Reservoir, the Principal Main, and Distribution. The town would use the dam at Deep Creek as their water supply, the same source that the Dismal Swamp Canal Company used. Next, Norfolk's government needed to buy a new pumping engine for fire prevention. Burnett advised that the town buy two or three Worthington Patent Engines, as it was the same model that the city of Savannah used. The Distributing Reservoir would be an iron tank with the ability to hold 250 thousand gallons of water. Burnett suggested that the Principal Main Line run from the Engine House into Main Street, and be linked to 125 fire hydrants. Burnett estimated that the city could finish this extensive 364 thousand dollar project in a year."," Burnett's proposal represented an effort for civic improvement that was characteristic of many cities in the South during the mid-nineteenth century. As Southern economic hubs, such as Norfolk, looked to increase their economic output, local governments began to focus on improving the urban environment of their cities. City officials wanted their communities to appeal to prospective business partners. With epidemic being closely related to a city's cleanliness, people looking to trade avoided cities that had a fertile environment for disease. If disease broke out, such as Norfolk's yellow fever epidemic just two years earlier, the flow of goods and agriculture would stop. Therefore, cities in the South created subsidiaries for the improvement of roads, fire protection, lighting, and water supply in order to prevent an outbreak of disease. It is important to note that these measures were mostly run for the economic interests of the businessmen and city officials, not for the health and well being of the people. Though the community definitely benefited from these improvements, the true purpose, driven by powerful business leaders, was to give their city better economic opportunity.

A yellow fever epidemic that spread throughout Eastern Virginia's Tidewater Region during 1855 did just that. Laura Reed, a resident of Portsmouth, Virginia, recounted the state of the town during the epidemic to her sister, Ellen Reed of Hampton, Virginia, in a letter on September 1, 1855. Laura described the damage to the community's population as severe, though the local physicians believed that the epidemic would be over soon. The doctors' opinion was that the epidemic would begin to decline after sixty days of exposure in the community. Since the fever had reached Portsmouth about a week after the Fourth of July, the town was optimistic for a return to good health. Laura noted that there had been a steady decrease in the amount of deaths last night, as only nine people had perished. Though Laura's immediate neighbors were now beginning to show an early sign of the fever, the black vomit, she reiterated to Ellen that she felt quite safe. Laura and her mother, with whom she lived with in Portsmouth, kept the house well ventilated and fumigated with chloride of lime and guano, safety measures that had been working well to ward off the fever. Though Laura and her mother may have avoided an infection, the yellow fever had severely crippled Portsmouth and the surrounding region.","Epidemics ravaged the Southern states during the mid-nineteenth century. The hot, humid summers that were characteristic of the South provided the perfect environment for the contraction and spread of infectious disease. Unfortunately, most Southern cities lacked the proper safety precautions and policies to effectively prevent and contain these deadly epidemics. The reason for this lack of preparation was economic. Since businessmen often ran most communities and cities during the time, they were hesitant to spend their money on costly town improvements. Officials believed the improvements were not worth the money that they cost. Though the need for these safety measures was quite obvious, funding for such projects was usually inadequate.","The economic effects of this yellow fever epidemic were catastrophic on the Tidewater economy, especially in the area's economic hub, Norfolk. The fear that the yellow fever caused was significant. This fear was warranted, as ten percent of the Norfolk population would be killed from the yellow fever. Due to the epidemic, Baltimore, New York, and the cities of Virginia placed a four month trade interdict on goods from Norfolk, a ban that deprived the Norfolk economy of an estimated five million dollars in trade profits. This paranoia effected more than just the economy, as many frightened Virginians rallied to get the state legislature in Richmond moved to a safer location. The city of Norfolk, and all of the surrounding Tidewater communities that depended on it, would need about five years to recover from their damaged economy and image."],"display_date":"September 1, 1855 - December 31, 1860","search_date":"1858-05-02","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2483,"title":"The Effects of Expansion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-02","end_date":"1855-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the mid-nineteenth century, the Union feuded over the issue of slavery expansion in the western territories. On January 2, 1849, the newspaper of Suffolk, Virginia, <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em>, printed an article entitled The Great Question. This article examined this turmoil, and pleaded the Union to mend its internal strife. The author explained that Northern fanatics in Congress were imposing abolition notions on the nation, efforts that threatened to bring the nation to the verge of disunion. Two new propositions were being discussed in Washington. The first was a proposal to abolish slavery in the nation's capital, and the second was a motion to bar slavery in California and New Mexico. The article contended that these two proposals had created a kindred feeling among all Southerners, regardless of their political orientation. The Northerners' proposals questioned the equality of a Southern man's property rights; it was hypocritical to allow a man from Ohio to move to Virginia with all his possessions, but to forbid a Virginian from bringing his property (slaves) into Ohio. The author attributed the source of these problems to the recent land acquisitions in the west, most notably the annexations of California, Texas, and New Mexico. The Great Question continued to examine this dilemma by describing the political stances of the Whig and Democratic parties. Though it was too late to quarrel over what has been done, the article claimed that the Whig party initially opposed the acquisition, and that the Democratic party supported the expansion. Therefore, the Intelligencer attributed the current turmoil to the Democrats. The article ends with a glimmer of hope, as the author believed that the councils of Congress would succeed, and reunite the North and South once again.","The article clearly summarizes the nation's state during the time of expansionism, and exposes the beginnings of clear sectional division. Though the nation had yet to split politically, the significance of these proposals would soon divide the Whigs and Democrats, creating sectional rifts that would weaken each party. The article describes proposals that would eventually help form the Compromise of 1850, a plan that would leave both Northerners and Southerners angry and unsettled. This turmoil would continue to heighten tensions between the regions. On a regional scope, the article's description of a newfound Southern unity is extremely important, as Southerners began to unite and to view the North as a common enemy. The mention of equal rights highlights one of the main issues bothering the Southerners, as many were angered that the Northerner's proposals threatened to take away their property. The seeds of disunion were beginning to sprout during this time period, and the nation was slowly moving towards bloody conflict."],"display_date":"January 2, 1849 - December 31, 1855","search_date":"1852-07-02","locations":[{"id":14073,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2498,"title":"The Revolution of the Immigrant Vote\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-08","end_date":"1861-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Political propaganda was not unique to the nineteenth-century South.

After going through the trouble, Jacques decided that he has had it with the Republicans and he gives tree cheer for Douglas. Ultimately, this article was an attempt to rally immigrants in support of the Democrat Party by showing that supporting Republicans would not give immigrants equal rights.","During the 1840s, the composition of America's workforce underwent a dramatic makeover. Immigrants came from predominantly two countries, Ireland and Germany, but also from an array of other European countries. This influx of foreign people would impact American society in virtually every way possible, whether through art, the economy, ideology, or culture. The newcomers provoked resistance to change and adaptation. The opposition to immigrants appeared in third-party platforms denying foreign-born citizens full political rights and eventually wove itself into the foundation of the Republican Party, with the Democrats as the opposition.","This article in the Staunton paper, January 8, 1861, shows how local activists encouraged immigrants to vote against the Republicans. Clearly Southern Democrat propaganda, this article promotes that party as a support of full citizen rights for foreign-born whites. Historian Gregg Kimball traces the immigrant impact of local and national politics, when European immigration sparked hostility during the Know-Nothing era of the 1840s and 1850s. Yet nativism and alienation of rights were undermined when local and national politicians needed the vote of the new immigrants. Where desire for disenfranchisment once existed, the Democratic Party had incorporated immigrants into the interests of its platform.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2518,"title":"News of Fort Sumter Rallies Supporters in Augusta County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-20","end_date":"1861-04-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James M.

He lived with his parents in Augusta County, while many members of his immediate family served in the Confederate Army. Having received information from a first-hand source in South Carolina, he provided a patriotic description of the local reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Augusta County rallied to support Virginia secession after no diplomatic answers came from the respresentatives that met with President Abraham Lincoln. Schreckhise's own brother was called out and sent to Harpers Ferry. Schreckhise embodied the jingoism that overwhelmed the county when he exclaimed, The Old Dominion has at length arisen from her slumber to shake off the chains of the abominable abolition tyrant. Schreckhise boasted confidently that he doubted there are a thousand votes that could be obtained for this state to remain in the Union.

After the attack on Sumter, the stage was set for war. No individual county caused the war or was the first to jump to battle. Relations between North and South had steadily declined prior to the bombardment of Fort Sumter. Virginia was a strong supporter of states' rights, and Lincoln's response to the bombardment was in clear violation of those rights. South Carolina had seceded, and Virginia believed that it was the right of South Carolina to do so. Lincoln's unwillingness to let South Carolina leave the Union, propelled Virginia into secession. ","Secession was not a rash choice for Virginia; it had been deliberated constantly. When Schreckhise mentions that there are not a thousand votes for Virginia to stay in the Union, this did not reflect irrationality, rather, people's mind were set carefully. Virginians, particularly those in Augusta County, had worked hard for reconciliation, but they would rather submit to war than have endured the ambiguity of war or peace any longer.

The store, like many others, had been shut down and its workers made unemployed. These stores had attracted business mainly from Southern customers, and prior to secession and growing divisions between North and South, this market was dramatically reduced. Bankruptcy of Northern stores provided wealthy Southerners with a sound investment. Not once did the advertisement mention the Abolitionist contribution to the failure of these stores, other than Abolitionism existed where these stores collapsed.

This organization ensure that Southerners would only buy Southern goods, and it promoted the construction of railroads, steamship lines, port facilities, banks, factories, and any other institutions that would create a more independent South. When secession was immanent, trade relations soured even more between the North and the South. The economic independence that the South strove for a decade earlier, would help that region create some of its own manufactories and allow for essential products to be made within the region.

Early routed almost two-thirds of Sheridan's forces at the Battle of Cedar Creek (October 19, 1864), but Sheridan's forces quickly rallied to defeat Early in a decisive victory there, leaving the remaining troops hungry and exhausted. After the defeat, most of Early's troops would rejoin Lee at Petersburg in December. Between those two events, General Early issued a broadside to troops, detailing expected actions in the counties of Augusta and Rockbridge. Even though his troops were severely undersupplied, General Early demanded that wheat and corn were not to be impressed from Augusta County. If corn was acquired, a proper receipt would provide documentation to ensure that nothing was impressed. Augusta County's economy was based on agriculture, and had these crops been used for Confederate soldiers, financial hardship for the county would have been even larger than it already was.","This broadside depicts an important relationship between the land of individual counties and the Confederate Army. Many citizens had grown angry with the Confederate government because of the infractions on their individual property. Civilians considered impressments an invasion of their individual rights, as well as a hypocritical function of a government that advocated states' rights.

Yielding supplies to troops, while suffering economic setbacks, further frustrated Souther supporters of the war. Since citizens felt that their personal liberties were violated, they took it upon themselves not to honor the prohibitions on trading with the enemy. The lack of economic support of the Confederate Army, as well as the lack of moral support from the citizens, because of impressments, created a situation that increasingly threatened Confederate ability to wage war.

Emotional duress was not unique to the Civil War; in every war, women have had to deal with losing a family member or a friend, or have helped friends to cope with their losses.

They truly believed that the questions so long pending between the North and the South must be settled. They chose to nominate William C. Rives and V.W Southall to represent Albemarle County at the state convention. Rives and Southall, if they accepted nomination and won election, would be immersed in one of the most important events in the history of Virginia, to decide whether or not to take the state out of the Union. Though the more than 550 men nominating Rives and Southall were in favor of secession if the Federal government failed to respect Virginia's rights, they permitted Rives and Southall to exercise their own judgment at the convention. The men of Albemarle County chose Rives and Southall because of their prominent place in the community. T.J Wertenbaker, E.R Watson, J.N.O.H Bibb, and F.K Nelson were the leaders of the group who nominated Rives and Southall because their names were the only ones specifically mentioned at the end of the note to Rives and Southall.","In January 1861, Governor Letcher called a special session of the Virginia legislature, which approved a plan for a state convention. One delegate to the convention was Robert Y. Conrad an emphatic Unionist who believed Abraham Lincoln was the cause of the sectional conflict. At the convention Conrad became Chairman of a Committee on Federal Relations which debated the merits of secession. While many men in the upper south loved the Union, they supported the right of the states to secede if they chose to do so. Conrad believed the right of the states' to secede came from the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Bill of Rights. Conrad even supported a Constitutional amendment to protect slavery. His Unionist majority defeated an ordinance of secession on April 4 88 to 45. However just two weeks later the secessionists won out, carrying the Convention eighty-eight to fifty-five, a near complete reversal of Unionist fortunes. Two events sealed the fate of the Unionist cause at the Convention, the firing on Ft. Sumter, and Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops. ","Men like Conrad had expressed the will of the majority of Virginians at the start of the Convention, to remain in the Union if Congress granted them concessions, but events outside of their control made peace with Abraham Lincoln seem impossible and secession the only solution. The men of Albemarle County who nominated Rives and Southall expressed the same will in their letter that they believed in the right of secession, but wanted to stay in the Union if possible. The process by which Virginia seceded expressed the early reluctance common across Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas to leave the Union.

Tennessee needed the revenue from the bonds to repay the forty million dollar deficit created by Civil War devastation.  A committee from the general assembly investigating Polk's personal accounts discovered that he transferred four hundred thousand dollars of the state's money into his bank account. The missing money made headline news across the state, but Polk fled before authorities could catch him.  Newspapers wildly speculated that he fled to either Mexico or South America, but nobody knew his whereabouts. The treasurer's friends believed that he lost the state's money speculating on Wall Street stocks.  The people of Nashville were outraged by another example of a long pattern of corruption that began during Reconstruction.  Congress moved quickly to pass a joint resolution that gave the attorney general the authority to seize Polk's assets.       Polk's fraud drew attention in every regional newspaper as well as The New York Times because Tennessee bondholders across the country were interested in the future of the forty million dollar state debt. Democrats blamed the origin of the  debt on railroad subsidization by Republican Governor George Brunlow during  Reconstruction.  In order to settle the debt, Democratic Governor John Calvin Brown's administration issued new bonds in 1873.  Economic depression prolonged the issue when the state defaulted on the interest payments.  With the state buried in debt, resolving the issue was the hottest political issue for the next ten years.  Democrats in control of the government divided into factions who called themselves Redeemers and Bourbons.  While Redeemers were confident that new industry would provide enough revenue to repay the debt, Bourbon Democrats envisioned a continuation of the Old South agriculture and lobbied to readjust the debt. Agricultural Democrats felt no moral obligation to repay debt that accumulated during the corrupt Republican administration.

The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

Republicans charged that the Ku Klux Klan intimidated both white and black voters on behalf of the Democratic Party.  In that election, C.A Sheafe won close election 44176 to 3810, but the Republicans should have won a landslide with 7,800 newly registered black voters.  The House of Representatives agreed with the conclusion of widespread voter intimidation and passed a resolution that gave the seat to the Republicans.","To verify the Republican's claim of voter intimidation, officials interviewed numerous voters representing both parties and the evidence showed the KKK did prevent Republicans from reaching the polls. George McMichael, a former slave from Coffee County, reported that he returned home after voting for the Republican ticket and found the Klan waiting for him.  They tied him down on a log and whipped him two hundred times.  An African American by the name of Washington Ore testified that The Klan surrounded his home, but he escaped by jumping through his window. He said, they shot two shots at me, but did not hit me at that time. When he returned to his house, his crops were torn to pieces in retaliation for his Republican vote.  Although the Klan was a small organization that was unpopular in the early 1870s,  the organization gained strength and helped the Democrats win back the state government  by the late 1870s. ","Horace Maynard and the Republicans' effort to secure black voting rights in Tennessee was a political struggle in a divided region. The emergence of seven thousand new black voters threatened to break the even division between Republicans on the eastern part of the state and the agricultural interests of middle Tennessee.  Tennessee had a history as a moderate state before the Civil War when it voted for the Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell instead of the Democrats. The same radical group of Democrats that pushed the moderate state of Tennessee into the Civil War, turned to violence in the postwar years to prevent a Republican advantage. Each party tried to forcefully keep the other away from the polls.  George Brunlow disfranchised the old Democrats until 1867. Once the Democrats, returned to the polls, Brunlow reluctantly gave African Americans the right to vote in order to solidify Republican power.  Tennessee was the first state in the South to take the monumental step to allow African Americans to vote.  When the Klan desperately resorted to violence and intimidation to gain a political advantage, Governor Brunlow, refused to certify the results in Tillman vs. Sheafe election.  He stated,  the votes cast for a candidate are illegal and his election void and that the KKK have used violence and other means of intimidation to deter legal voters from exercising franchisement.  With a slim majority threatened, Republicans fought to secure black voting rights for political reasons rather than the moral cause of equality.  Similarly, the Klan showed that they were not primarily motivated by race when they attacked large numbers of white and black Republicans.  Tennessee Republicans were more concerned with building new industry than the impoverished condition of African Americans that did not improve under their administration.  Republicans knew that the Party of Lincoln did not need to help African Americans to guarantee their votes on election day.

Macon was also quick to state that he later served in combat with this unit during the war between the states.Serving in such a unit was special to Macon because it was a clear act of serving his community. Not only did he drill to protect his home, but the men on either side of him were his friends and neighbors, prepared to make the same sacrifice alongside him.  His service in this unit made him an object of admiration and pride in the community, the concept of a noble southern gentleman defending his city.  However, Macon's youthful enthusiasm was most certainly curtailed when he experienced the harsh reality of the Civil War battlefield, where the pageantry and glory of parades through downtown Richmond would be replaced by the acrid smell of cordite and the cries of the dying. ","In the 1850s, with the memory of British tyranny not far from the minds of many Americans, there was still a great deal of wariness in regards to the idea of a standing federal army and professional military leadership.  Beginning in 1792,Congress began requiring able bodied men to serve in local militia units.  In 1808, the law provided that authority over these units fell to the state governor rather than the federal government, a forerunner of the modern National Guard.  With distrust of federal forces being particularly prevalent in the South, militias such as the Public Guard in Richmond were formed to provide local communities with some military muscle.  These militias provided well armed and well-disciplined units that could provide security in times of unrest, as well as acting as a type of police force.  While few, if any southerners would explicitly say so, these units also gave southerners peace of mind in the sense that any slave revolt would be met by a rapid and lethal response from local units who would not be subject to bureaucratic or political red tape as federal troops would be.","    This idea of military self sufficiency also led to a new martial state of mind in the southern gentry, whereby they stoked the idea of their ancestors being dashing Cavaliers, fighting across the plains of England during its Civil War in defense of their ideals.

President Andrew Jackson, who prided himself on improving the lives and representing the interests of the common white man, objected to the Second Bank of the United States and sought to destroy it. Roger Taney, the newly appointed Secretary of the Treasury and a firm believer in Jacksonian principles sponsored a dinner in Cecil County to increase Jacksonian electoral support in the upcoming Maryland state elections. The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported that over 500 supporters of Andrew Jackson gathered in Cecil, Maryland to honor the political activist, Roger Taney. Taney warned the supporters of the great threat of the Second Bank of the United States and stated that the battle was almost over. Mr. Taney concluded his speech with these words: recollect at the ensuing elections, [to determine] whether the Bank or the People would rule this happy country. However, Taney's message would only resonate in the small farming communities of Cecil County. "," The Maryland state legislature elections occurred in October, one month after Taney's dinner party. The Baltimore Patriot printed the election results, listing each county name and the number of seats won by the Jacksonian and Whig party. The election allowed members of each party to win up to four seats in each Maryland county. The Jackson Republicans won four seats in the heavily agrarian county of Cecil, where Jacksonian principles may have influenced their vote. Southern counties in Maryland, such as Talbot, Somerset, Dorchester, and Worchester County elected Whig party members to fill the majority of their seats. With support from most of the counties in Maryland, the Whigs held an overwhelming majority of 77 to 18 in the state legislature. According to historians Richard Walsh and William Fox, many of the Maryland voters in the state election were sympathetic to the Bank of the United States and disliked Jackson and Taney's fiscal policies. The Second Bank of the United States thrived from the tax revenue deposited by the federal government. Working with Roger Taney, Jackson strategically removed funds from the Second Bank of the United States and placed the revenue into local pet banks to lessen the power of the Bank. However Jackson and Taney's plan led to economic instability and recession in Maryland and other areas in the South. After the election one southern Maryland Whig supporter stated in the Baltimore Patriot that the experiment [removal of the deposits] works badly. Mr. Taney does not keep the wheels well greased.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

Eugene Davis was one such prisoner of war at Elmira Military Prison in 1864. The two most infamous Civil War prisons opened that year in Andersonville, Georgiaand at Elmira, New York. After he arrived in Elmira, Davis wrote to his family in Albemarle County, who promptly wrote him back. He received letters from three different relatives in one day. Davis explained that he lived in a building with 150 other Confederates. He had a cold before he wrote the letter, but recovered from it. Davis also mentioned both the number of times per day guards fed prisoners at Elmira and how the entire camp went to the same building to procure rations every day. Eugene Davis expressed great confidence that he would survive the prison camp, and hoped for more letters from his family. ","Prisoners of war suffered enormously in 1864 and 1865 in both the Union and the Confederacy. Union soldiers in Andersonville Prison suffered from exposure because of lack of shelter, dysentery and diarrhea due to poor diet, and sometimes death because of the lack of medical care. The Confederacy suffered in large measure because of the lack of a clear chain of command over the Confederate prison system in general, and inefficient command structure at Andersonville. Georgia officials made matters worse by repeatedly refusing to cooperate in the supply of lumber, regular guards, slave labor, cattle drivers, and tents to the prison. Andersonville had an intended capacity of 10,000. By May 1864, it was 50 percent over capacity. By mid June the prison contained 24,000 Union prisoners. In a pattern to be repeated in both Union and Confederate prisons, as the prison population grew, food and other supplies did not keep up and deteriorated to extremes. In addition the Confederate government gradually became totally negligent towards the prisoners at Andersonville, while more than willing to continue to send prisoners there over the protests of the administrators of the camp. Henry Wirz and John H. Winder, two of the officers in charge, could not keep up with the tide of incoming Union prisoners during the summer of 1864. The situation at Andersonville reached a tipping point on July 25 1864 when more than 30,000 prisoners were present at the camp with no rations to feed them. Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon and others only changed the situation when Sherman's Union armies drew close to Andersonville that fall. Ten thousand of the Andersonville prisoners were shipped to Salisbury, North Carolina by October 1864. Just four months later, due to further Confederate neglect, 34 percent of these men had died. ","Confederate prisoners of war at Elmira suffered many of the same troubles as Andersonville prisoners. Despite the economic advantages of the Union over the Confederacy, lack of food in sufficient quality and quantity to keep prisoners healthy was a problem. This suggests that like in the Confederacy, maltreatment of prisoners was not a result of inability to help them but of unwillingness by individuals in the Union prison system. As at Andersonville, as the prisoner population of Elmira increased, the food problem worsened. Eugene Davis wrote in his letter of the many thousands of men in Elmira who all had to use the same cook-house. Scurvy emerged due to poor diet, just as at Confederate prison camps. Both Elmira and Andersonville had no hospital to care for the sick for much of their operation. Andersonville was closed in the early fall of 1864, but Elmira remained open, and bore witness to even greater suffering by prisoners in 1865. A new enemy attacked Confederate prisoners in Elmira in the winter of 1864-1865, New York's cold weather. Confederates found it especially difficult to deal with because stoves were scarce. In February 1865, 426 Confederates died at Elmira about a third of all the sick. Though Andersonville may be more famous as a place of misery for prisoners of war, Elmira actually had a higher mortality rate, 24 percent, or 3,000 out of 12,000 total prisoners. Eugene Davis' letter to his daughter is very significant to understanding the lives of prisoners of war. He wrote of the hardships of camp life, of his desire to hear from his family, and his yearning to think of his home, not his prison. The suffering and uncertainty felt by Eugene Davis' family while he was a prisoner of war repeated itself in counties all over Virginia and all over the South, as Confederate soldiers tried to survive the war in prisoner of war camps.

Within the next two decades the American Colonization Society formed chapters in Maryland and other Southern states. Many chapters of the American Colonization Society advocated the creation of Liberia, an area on the tip of Africa, as a homeland for freed slaves while other chapters were interested in establishing a colony in Canada, Central America, and/or Haiti. Following the colonization trends of the time, the Richmond Enquirer reported in 1830 that Ohio will send good slaves to Canada. In Ohio, and in other areas across the South, whites became fearful of the ever increasing free and slave population. Trustees of the Cincinnati, Ohio Township met to discuss a plan to address citizen concerns and ultimately decided to peruse African colonization in Canada. The trustees expect that over 1000 slaves and mulattos will travel to the Canada and once there, the British government would have jurisdiction over the new arrivals. Charles, Maryland headquarters for the Organization of the Maryland Colonization Society, would subsequently advocate for the colonization of free blacks to Canada a few months later. "," Maryland experienced rapid growth of its free black population in the early 1800s. According to Walsh and Fox, historians of Maryland culture, the diverse agriculture of Maryland, the presence of manufacturing and the extensive development of railroads attracted many free blacks to the area. By 1830, the black population in Maryland increased by 150 percent. Free blacks experienced more personal freedom in Maryland and could marry, own property, fill suit in court, and operate businesses. Culturally, southern Maryland resembled that of other Southern states and free blacks easily acclimated to their new environments. "," White fears of black rebellion and future integration of free blacks into white society promoted of the idea of free black colonization in Maryland. Members of the Organization of the Maryland Colonization Society believed the removal free blacks from the area to Canada would alleviate white racial tensions and fear. Free blacks and their growing presence in the South and even in the Midwest continued to bring about concern and fears from white Americans."],"display_date":"January 1, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-01","locations":[{"id":5971,"lat":38.28057998,"lng":-77.0012385843,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARLES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2637,"title":"Temperance Begins in Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-07-08","end_date":"1874-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["NO ALCOHOL SALES ON SUNDAY signs popped up everywhere after July 8, 1861 when an ordinance prohibiting the sale of liquor on Sunday passed. The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

The Georgia Democrats met on August 25, 1876 to discuss their common ideals. The speakers emphasized that Georgia had always adhered to the old constitution and have continued to be patriotic to the antebellum union government. They also criticized the Republicans for inflicting the South with Reconstruction policies. They were angry with how harshly the Republicans had treated southerners after the Civil War and encouraged Democrats to stay united in spite of the Republicans' offenses. Blaming the poor state of the nation on northern Republicans, they highlighted the Southern qualities of intelligence, virtue, and property that would make the Democrats' control of the country better. ","There was animosity in the South toward the northern Republicans, due to the fact that the Republicans were their opposition in the Civil War, ended the system of slavery, and imposed harsh policies in Reconstruction. The policies of Reconstruction did not improve the economy enough for the whole South. People were devastated by the war and had to establish a new system of making a living for themselves without slaves. Historian Eric Foner observed that the failure to produce tangible benefits among freedmen produced growing disillusionment with the Republicans throughout the South. The Republicans only offered limited aid to struggling Southerners when they were in great need of it. Whites and blacks both felt that their lives were not improved by Reconstruction and resented the Republican Party. ","Since this rally took place in August of a major election year, the Democrats were probably trying to gather support as election time got closer. The Democrats felt that they had an opportunity to reclaim power due to the economic Panic of 1873 and the scandals that occurred under the presidency of Grant. According to William H. Rehnquist, accounts of the time show that people guessed about the outcome and were prepared for a close vote, but scarcely anyone guessed just how close it would be. The Democrats were correct to try to get as much support as possible. The Republican candidate won the election by only one electoral vote and a conflict erupted in the nation over the possibility of counting votes wrong. The Compromise of 1877 allowed the Republicans to keep the presidency as long as they ended Reconstruction. Thus, this was an important election year in ending Reconstruction in the South when it was important for the Democrats to try to rally as much support as possible."],"display_date":"August 25, 1876","search_date":"1876-08-25","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2670,"title":"Connection of a Railways Through Augusta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-05-01","end_date":"1884-05-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Port Royal railroad company came into conflict with the city of Augusta when it intended to build a railway through the city which would be in competition with local transportation providers. The company claimed to have legal rights to connect the tracks through the city. The city claimed that they had no more legal rights to continue building tracks in Augusta. The business owners in the city were upset that the company would have the sole rights to transportation within the city. Thus, the company had to stop building until the city reached a decision.","City governments had to make policies to encourage economic growth in the area. During Reconstruction, a veritable mania spread among white Southerners that building railroads provided the key to economic recovery according to David Donald, Jean Baker, and Michael Holt. The building of the railway would have improved the local and state economies by allowing farmers to make products that could be shipped on them. It would also allow people to produce only cash crops and then buy things they needed that would be transported on the railways. As historian Eric Foner noted, direct trade routes could be established with the North. The southern states could benefit from the industrialization of the North and the products made there while the North could benefit from the agriculture of the South. This would integrate the commerce of the nation and create a greater sense of unity. Local businessmen, however, felt that the railways would take away from their economic profits by monopolizing transportation. There was political corruption concerning the railroads and businessmen were justified in their feelings that some might have been given unfair advantages. Foner noted that Republicans in charge of making railroad assignments were able to accept bribes for control to railway access and distribute based on patronage. Although the railway system had benefits for the greater economy, there were local problems that made legislation on the issue difficult.

Bolling's appointment shows that the military was prominent in state forms as well as national forms in the period leading up to the Civil War. Qualities of the military include fidelity, courage, activity and good conduct - qualities that are still valued in the military today. Bolling was selected as Lieutenant Colonel because of these qualities and his dedication to his country through prior military service. His appointment was a strong opinion on his character and loyalty. "," Previous military conflicts had left the United States with a stronger sense of having a military and how they should use one in wartime. The War of 1812 left the young country shocked that England would attack them again, but also proud that they had fended off the most powerful nation in the world. The 1815 Battle of New Orleans proved to be the major triumphant victory in the war that increased America's international influence. Despite the fact that the Treat of Ghent (1814) had ended the war, the Americans still legitimately beat the British in the War of 1812, a feat to be proud of because of the British's dominance in the military world. "," This war had left the country suspicious of more attacks from other invaders or powerful countries coming in to try to re-colonize America. Americans believed that other powerful European countries would come over to try to colonize America because of their immense natural resources and large amount of land. These suspicions led to the build up of the American military and Reserves, so that they would be ready just in case another country waged war against them again. The Reserves consisted of the national military and state militias; they were constantly trained and only used in case of an emergency. The military may not have been engaged in battle, but they would be ready if it came about again. An army was maintained in both the North and the South."," Virginia was especially known for its Navy because of the port of Norfolk in the Tidewater. Many wealthy planters and businessmen in Virginia had either served in the Navy or had a son who had. Military education became popular in the first decade of the nineteenth century; many wealthy planters either attended a military institute or sent their sons there to train for military service. The notions of honor and prestige mentioned in Bolling letter were major motives for wealthy planters joining the military. Holding a leadership role in the military was especially prestigious at this time period and many men of the upper class held these positions; men in leadership positions held large amounts of honor, but did not have engage in the actual fighting. "," William Bolling was part of the Commonwealth's military; this is evident in his appointment because he was appointed by the governor, a state official, rather than a national official. This shows that states were beginning to look at states' rights and hold pride in their state. Each state had their own militia to defend themselves against any other state. They brought their militias together in times of need to fight for the country. Each state was responsible of training and maintaining their militia. These state militias stayed in effect until the Civil War when they came together as the Confederate Army. State militias and the national military were important to the United States in both wartime and peacetime in the decades before the Civil War.

This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

The inscription chosen by Governor Chapman of Alabama read as follows: Alabama. A union of equality, as adjusted by the Constitution. This dedication was authorized by the Alabama General Assembly on December 4, 1849. ","The editor of the <em>Huntsville Democrat</em>, a newspaper based in Madison County, Alabama, responded to the Governor's inscription on the stone in his May 16 editorial. In his column, the editor expressed many of the same sentiments toward the Union that the stone's inscription had implied. He expressed his belief in a Union of equality, in which sovereign states were bound together by mutual interests and the obligations set out by the Constitution. Under these precepts, he felt that each state should not have to sacrifice its own identity and beliefs at the expense of the national majority. To illustrate his point, the editor used an analogy comparing the states in the Union to the stones which made up the Washington Monument. He argued that each state, like the individual stones of the monument, could act as its own separate entity maintaining its own identity and still be incorporated as a part of the larger whole. ","The motto on the Alabama stone of the Washington Monument and the editorial in the <em>Huntsville Democrat</em> alluded to growing sectionalism in the United States. This sectionalism was agitated by the possibility of Congress limiting the practice of slavery in the new territories acquired in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War. According to the authors of <em>Alabama: The History of a Deep South State</em>, the people of Alabama interpreted the United States policy against slavery as an attack on their individual rights as a sovereign state. These sentiments serve to reflect the strict constructionist ideology of many Southerners who believed that since the Constitution did not directly grant the Federal Government control over the issue of slavery, all decisions concerning the institution should be delegated to the States. The editor of the Huntsville Democrat clearly echoed this perspective in his May 16 article. The growing antipathy towards the Union was prevalent not only in Alabama but also in other states across the South.

Hardwick, who was the treasurer of Westmoreland County, Virginia at that time. During that time, everyone had to pay one dollar to the state and fifty cents to the county per head. Taxes were based on every one hundred dollars worth of property. For example, it was thirty cents for state tax, ten cents for state school tax, and fifteen cents for road tax. Mr. Thomas Brown had 945 dollars worth of property, so he paid thirteen dollars in state tax, 3.97 dollars in state school tax, and 5.83 dollars in road tax. The government collected these taxes to pay for education, improvements in the town, and other public expenditures. Even with these taxes, Virginia was deeply in debt. "," The decade before the 1890s, Virginia pushed itself continuously further into debt as the Conservative party refused to stray from the Funding Act, even in spite of the evil name attached to the origins of the Funding Act, according to C. Vann Woodward. To try to compensate for the debt in other areas, the Funders bilked money from public schools, leaving the schools without proper funding. In the South, the public schools were 1.5 million dollars in debt, which forced many of them not to reopen the following years. By 1890, the monetary expenditure per student had slowly increased to 81 percent from 59.5 percent in 1871. The money expended augmented to about 97 cents, an increase for the South, but was still less than the 2.24 dollars for the country as a whole.

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2734,"title":"Agricultural Advances\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-10-19","end_date":"1876-10-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" It was October and the farmers belonging to the Piedmont Agricultural Society had gathered to hear a speech from Mr. William Fullerton.

He also reminded the farmers to make sure they were rotating their crops so they were not depleting the soil of the nutrients they were attempting to restore.

Many were pushing aside interests in agriculture at the same time that self-reliance and independence were becoming more important for the individual farmers. Things had gotten so bad that the governments had to step in and they were proposing remedies, new techniques of farming, and advising the farmers on improving their attitudes in regards to farming. As Perman points out, when the government got involved with agriculture, especially the Democratic Party, claiming that cultivation had to become more efficient and more up to date, even things like elections were influenced over the issue of agriculture. Since the Democratic leaders were perceived as better at advising farmers on these techniques to improve their farming methods, the farmers who followed this advice began to actually see change, and this influenced them to vote for the Democratic Party.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O.

Bundy and his Union comrades were invited to ride up the Red River to Shreveport on the Confederate flag-of-truce boat before a conference with southern officers about terms of surrender. Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence. This poor white man complained that his crops just began growing, but he was too poor and weak to fix the fence, whose destruction meant starvation for himself and his family."," Both Bundy and a Confederate officer felt sympathy for this man, saying so to the men stealing the wood. The Confederate officer explained the problematic nature of this situation, professing, Our people only know one part of making war. They known how to fight, and that's all. The southern men have no business faculty. Although this officer requested supplies many times, his soldiers were naked and starving in their own homeland, the South. Bundy and the Rebel officer agreed upon the injustice of taking from an impoverished family.

The extreme poverty suffered by a large portion of southerners during the Civil War was horrifying to this northern man. He and his enemy, a Confederate officer, shared the same opinion on the poor white southerner's situation: it was unfair for a quartermaster to destroy a family to attain a few pieces of wood. According to Boles, towards the end of the war, however, conditions worsened for soldiers and civilians alike, as the economy continued to deteriorate through a lack of Confederate economic policy. Boles illuminates families' struggles with starvation, and conquering Union troops, embittered too by the continuing war, made fewer exemptions for civilians, feeling less guilt at taking fence rails and other amenities. Bundy and his comrades were en route to finalize surrender by the Louisiana armies and still civilians suffered at the hand of apathetic officials. Bundy, unable to forget the unfortunate fate of this family, witnessed a typical tragedy throughout the poverty-stricken South, a family unable to sustain itself and apathy of exhausted officials.

A bill introduced in the Confederate Senate allowed the government to impress all the cotton in the Confederate States and then paid for it in Confederate bonds at fifteen cents per pound. In an attempt to pay its debts, the government in Richmond would have a monopoly of the cotton trade. Reminiscent of a centralized despotism, the government possessed the ability to take the property of the citizen in order to trade and make a profit on it. In order to preserve the safety of the people, citizens sought restrictions on those in power. This bill exceeded the Confederate government?s right of eminent domain or inherent sovereign power. North Carolinians wanted to preserve the Constitution their ancestors fought for; this goal was reached through vigilance over those in power.","Citizens of North Carolina protested against the despotism that would undermine their Constitutional liberties. As a result of the encroachment by the leaders in Richmond, North Carolina became increasingly dissatisfied with the Confederacy. Governor Vance and others led the fight by fiercely defying the prospect of a unified southern despotism and objecting to Jefferson Davis? dictatorial power and his ability to centralize war measures. Southerners contested Davis? ability to suppress the ancient principle of states? rights; they feared a fundamental change in their way of life and in the rights they possessed.

In the introduction, the authors stated that their intention was to give people seeking a new home a brief description of the area and the advantages it offers as one of the foremost cities of the South. Throughout the book, they gave detailed accounts of various aspects of the county, including its public and private facilities, advantages and needs, and its relation to the state as a larger whole in terms of its products, climate, government, and people. "," When the handbook begins discussing the people of Durham, it mentions the negro population, and states that it was largely descended from former slaves, but the importation of those forced laborers was very rare at the beginning of the 18th century onwards. The authors then attributed the large number of blacks in the area to natural causes such as a healthy climate, a humane public system, and the kindly tempers of the owner They stated that African Americans were happy to stay within the state because of the affection shown to them by their previous masters. Since slaves' emancipation, the book claimed African Americans have been shown absolute equal rights, with the exception of the slightly larger poll-tax and property tax, which the writers attributed to their population within the state, not their particular race. When discussing suffrage later in the hand-book, the authors explained why African Americans are withheld from administering to the law themselves as magistrates. It is because, explained the authors, blacks have just been released from slavery and are therefore ignorant of the duties of citizenship. This, the authors claimed, is for everyone's safety, including the colored man. "," This extract is a commentary on the county of Durham that reveals a great deal about their identity. The Educator Company explains current race relations and demographics with a history of the treatment of African Americans, and claims that Durham is a harmonious community now because it has always been so, even in the times of slavery. This belief, as well as the reasoning behind the disenfranchisement of African American's rights, is representative of many other counties' and states' racial ideologies in the South at the turn of the 19th century. "," At this point in time, several southern states were passing laws or constitutional amendments depriving black citizens of their right to vote, or at least making it very difficult to do so. Jim Crow laws were also very popular, and North Carolina was on the brink of adopting the separate but equal statute following the Plessy v. Ferguson trial. Finally, a ruthless white-supremacy campaign launched in 1898 completed a decade of setbacks for African Americans living in North Carolina. This second-class citizenship was adopted by local, state, and national legislatures, and indeed, the vast majority of Americans. However, despite these obstacles, the black community still focused on improving their condition and bettering their community.

On May 8, 1839, the Mobile Commercial Register published that a committee was investigating reports of certain cruelties towards prisoners. Upon surveying the prison, the committee confirmed that the prison keepers did in fact torture and whip the prisoners, so much that the doctors frequently had to visit to treat their wounds. They also starved them and worked them like horses. They lived in dungeons as dark as death that were kept at practically freezing temperatures. The paper described most of the prison superintendents as sheer brutes, and thus, such allegations should be expected.","Although the article did not call for any reforming action, many southerners disagreed with the penitentiary system. Those who were in favor of prisons said such institutions were favorable for reforming the individual and making the law more effective. On the other side of the debate, some southerners found reforming criminals to be dangerous and useless, preferring the old methods of fines, branding, local jails, and hangings. In 1834, a referendum in Alabama on prisons reported that voters were overwhelmingly opposed to the system. Nevertheless, the southern penitentiary system continued to expand.","Once created, local governments did not like spending money on prisons. Therefore, imprisonment could become an agonizing ordeal, as it was for the prisoners at Auburn. To raise the funds for upkeep, prisons leased out the prisoners to work in harsh conditions. The prison officials at Auburn were much like the ones all over the South, dealing out severe physical punishments, providing poor food, and focusing more on how they could profit from leases themselves. Even though many citizens were outraged at the conditions seen in Auburn, they did not take any progressive action. In fact, no action was taken in regards to the prison at Auburn until 1862.

Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

President Jackson was a strong opponent of Indian tribes. On May 28, 1830, President Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act. Congress passed the treaty in order to relocate the Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands in the west. Although, the act did not order the removal of the Indians, it did allow the president to negotiate land by exchanging treaties with tribes living within the boundaries of the states. ","President Jackson's first annual message to Congress in December gave him great pleasure to announce to Congress that the Removal Act was approaching to a happy consummation. He reported that two important tribes had accepted the provisions made for their removal at the last session of Congress and believed that the two tribe's examples would induce the remaining tribes to seek the same obvious advantages. President Jackson was supportive of a speedy removal and he felt it was important not only to the United States but to the Indians themselves. According to Jackson, moving the Indians would separate them from immediate contact with settlements of whites, free them from the power of the States, enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and would stop their slow extinction. ","President Jackson told Congress that he felt the act was fair because a fair exchange of land was being granted and because the General Government proposed to pay the whole expense of the red man's removal and settlement... In his closing statements, President Jackson hoped that all good citizens, especially those that felt the Indians were being oppressed by the subjection to the laws of the States, would unite, help influence and enforce a speedy removal for the better of both the red men and white Americans. The Removal Act would benefit white settlement and allow the country's citizens to inhabit up and down the eastern coast. This included certain southern states such as Georgia and Florida, which was recently acquired from the Spanish. Most white Americans supported the Removal Act, especially southerners who were eager to expand southward. Expansion south would be good for the country and the future of the country's economy with the later introduction of cotton production in the south. Yet, there was still significant opposition to the act. Some of the people that opposed the act were Christian missionaries. Even though there was opposition to Jackson's view of the Removal Act, those who were opposed were not able to stop Jackson and the nation from removing the Indians as fast as possible.

On Wednesday, October 6, 1897, North Carolina Governor Daniel L. Russell dismissed Otho Wilson, the railroad commissioner, for conspiring with the Southern Railway Company to promote his own economic interest. Wilson did this by appealing to the railway company to stop at his hotel in order to increase the eating-house's business. According to Russell and the witnesses gathered by him to testify against Wilson, this had a negative impact on many businesses in Hickory, North Carolina, the stop that was replaced by Wilson's hotel. The town's only restaurant was forced to close when the train ceased stopping there. Others faced difficulties in transporting or receiving merchandise, and many were inconvenienced by the extra travel now required to reach the closest railroad station. Not only did the effect Wilson's actions had on the town of Hickory warrant his dismissal, but Russell argued that by placing himself under obligations not only to the Southern Railway Company it disqualified him to act as a fair, impartial judge and juror in any controversy that might arise between such corporations and individual citizens. "," A few years later on January 25, 1899, a group of people decided to contest this decision and wrote an appeal to Governor Russell asking for an explanation, as they felt Wilson's dismissal was unjust. Russell responded with a lengthy document that described Wilson's misdeeds and explained how severely he had affected the town of Hickory solely for his own monetary gain. Russell, the first Republican Governor of North Carolina since the end of Reconstruction and the last until 1973, was chastised relentlessly by the Democrats, who took Wilson's indictment for bribery, as well as that of Dr. Moss, the Chairman of the Commissioners of Vance County, to reflect personally upon Russel's legislature since he had originally appointed them to those positions. The Democrats argued that those officials' effects on North Carolina politics and the economies of local towns was unforgivable, and must be corrected with a new Democratic governor. "," This scenario reveals a great deal about both the importance of transportation in South at this time and the politics involved with that institution. At this time, the railroad was the most effective means of transportation throughout the South. As the railroad tracks quickly lengthened, so did the population and industry of places with train stations. Therefore, a railroad commissioner usually made decisions about stopping points with great deliberation because their impact on towns would be considerable, which explains why Wilson's crime was so grave. Also, since railroads were the primary mode of transportation, the politics surrounding them were intense, and as historian Leslie Decker claims, often involved conflicts between political and economic interests. This can be seen in Russell's dilemma and in the reasons cited by the Democrats for his incompetence.

The North Carolina House of Representatives convicted Holden on six out of an initial eight charges levied against him by the North Carolina Senate. Among the impeachment charges: that he had proclaimed insurrection, declared martial law, made illegal arrests of eighty-two citizens of Alamance, recruited soldiers illegally in the state, and refused to obey the writ of habeas corpus. Forty-nine Representatives were present at the voting, and a two-thirds vote was required to convict. ","In 1870, Holden had imposed martial law in order to combat the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). As a result of his suspending the writ of habeas corpus for accused members of the KKK, the Republicans lost the election of 1870. When the Democrats regained political power, thus initiating the fall of southern Republicanism, they introduced a resolution to impeach the governor.","Following the impeachment of Holden, the legislature reduced the cost of the state government, investigated the charges of fraud in the issuance of railroad bonds, repealed the Shoffner Act, and declared secret political societies illegal. By ignoring the ruling of the North Carolina Supreme Court and by illegally instigating martial law, the impeachment of Governor Holden was the appropriate reprimand for his actions. However, historian Edgar E. Folk opposed this viewpoint and instead proposed that Governor Holden was a victim of his era rather than its primary villain.

","Thus, when W.W. Price of the northern cotton house Hubbard, Price & Co. arrived in Jackson, Mississippi in 1891 in order to begin establishing a branch house in the city, he was not labeled a carpetbagger. Jackson, according to the Jackson Clarion Ledger, welcomed him in November of 1891, and claimed his enterprise will be of incalculable benefit to the community at large. White southerners, in the words of Richard Nelson Current, were no longer suspicious of Northerners who went south...[to] get rich by plundering the Southern people. They no longer feared negro rule; although black politician Hiram Revels stated, as reprinted by James Wilford Garner, that black voters during reconstruction had been used as mere tools to elect imprudent [and corrupt] men who called themselves Republicans, after 1890, they were no longer used at all. The chivalrous (?) [sic] white Democrats, according to the Cleveland Gazette, were therefore quite content.","Blacks of Mississippi and of the nation as a whole, however, were not pleased. The Atlantic Monthly noted by 1892 that The Fifteenth Amendment is disregarded [in Mississippi] where it is not nullified on the face of the state law. Reporting on this system of Jim Crow law, the Cleveland Gazette noted that the state of Mississippi was referred to by blacks as his Satanic Majesty's abiding place.","The problem, however, was that his Satanic Majesty sometimes left home. According to The Atlantic Monthly, candid Republicans at the North admit that domination by the ignorant blacks of the Gulf States is something to be dreaded. The suppression of the negro vote, wherever such a step is necessary to secure control of the government by the whites, is winked at, if not applauded. For some reason, be it simple racism or otherwise, the 1890 Mississippi constitution made sense to both Democrats and Republicans in both the South and the North. ","It made so much sense that the Justices of the United States Supreme Court, arguably some of the brightest legal minds of the time, supported it in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. As decided by the majority, Justice McKenna, a newly appointed Californian, opined that the statutes of the 1890 Mississippi constitution do not on their face discriminate between the races, and it has not been shown that their actual administration was evil; only that evil was possible under them. The Cleveland Gazette had known this since 1890, as they said the handwriting warning of such evil was on the wall, put there by the on-goings of the white supremacy convention.

The President was passing through on his way to Jacksonville, Florida, and he had been expected for a couple days. But finally, on April 5, 1883, his train came through. The train pulled into the station, and while it was clearly an expensive and impressive presidential car, it was not very extravagant. The observation deck made it clear that it was for a prominent statesman. However, even though many people showed up to see him, the President did not get out of his car. He waved from the window, and was dressed well in a top hat and suit. He seemed in a cheerful mood since he smiled at the car from behind the window. The train continued on its way to Florida, and arrived there the next day. Yet it was a big day in Petersburg and many were excited to have caught a glimpse of the President. "," Chester Arthur was the Republican president from 1881-1885 as a result of the assassination of President James A. Garfield. In 1882 the presidency was in shambles, with cabinet positions still waiting to be filled. Corruption was rampant, and the President was restricted by his party and had little real power. Republicans did not do well in the Congressional elections of 1882, and in reaction to this, Arthur signed the Pendleton Reform Bill. This bill began to make some changes towards reform. It created a Civil Service Commission to administer new rules and it made appointments based on an examination. While these reforms were a good beginning, they were not enough. In the beginning of 1883, it was clear that Arthur's chances for winning re-election were slim. The political climate of 1883 was not positive for the President. In general there had been a decline in the prestige of the President in the 1870's and early 1880's as a result of massive corruption and unpopular policies, especially with Reconstruction in the South. Presidents of the late nineteenth century seemed to have no real purpose once they were elected. This lack of purpose gave few results within the government. However, it was clearly still an event to see the leader of the country, even in the South. He had a strong alliance with many in Virginia, including Governor William Mahone. Arthur was one of a string of lackluster Presidents in the postbellum period, yet even with his unimpressive performance, his arrival in town still brought excitement.

Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize. He was lambasted by the Cleveland Gazette, which called his defense of the monstrous franchise provision...a disgrace to the race and to our civilization, and wished he had never been born. For all of their objections, however, Mississippi, and the rest of the South, as many other states followed suit, plunged itself headfirst into a half-century of legal disenfranchisement and discrimination.

The public school system would be supported by taxation since this was the only way to insure its success. ","The measure proposed in Raleigh is only a small step in the right direction. The South must persist in its endeavor, as the New York Times would argue, by establishing a system of public schools in all the States. In some states, the proportion of illiterates to literates in the population is alarming. Through the establishment of free public schools, the South can fulfill its chief need: education.","There were many reasons for the lack of schooling in the South. Neither the wealthy planters nor the poor farmers pressured the Southern legislatures to spend money on education. Neither group saw much benefit in public education for themselves or their children. Certain Southern whites disliked the idea of educating blacks because they feared that such education might threaten white supremacy. Though they rendered perfunctory tribute to public education in their messages to the legislature, as historian Albert Ray Newsome observes, the governors were in most cases indifferent to education.

After his purchases Isaac wrote to Hayne informing him of what he bought and each items price. His purchases included: 30 men's frock coats, twilled cotton and wool, at forty cents per yard, 12 boys coats, 175 yards of GDB cloth, and 175 yards of wool for women, both at forty eight cents per yard. The bill, which included other clothing materials, amounted to 100.  Isaac makes a defined effort to tell Hayne what materials remained at the same price from his trip the previous year, which was mainly the price per yard of cloth. Isaac did note that there were some increased changes in prices over the past year, to which he asks what the benefits of the Tariff of 1842 were, relating to the effects it had on the price of cloth. ","The Tariff Act of 1842 was passed in response to the Tariff Acts of 1832 and 1833, both of which imposed high duties on goods produced within the United States, including cotton and woolen goods. The Tariff Act of 1833 meant to gradually reduce duty rates, which it did, until 1842, when there was a drastic, forty-two percent drop in rates within a six-month period, down to twenty percent.  Duties were supposed to remain at this rate indefinitely, but only lasted two months, due to a quarrel between the Whig Party and President Tyler, which had caused them to separate.  The Tariff Act of 1842 got caught up in the eventual agreement made between the two, which caused the duties to be higher than the original twenty percent rate.  Consequently, the public was not very enthused about the tariff, as they realized that it did not conform to the wishes of the manufacturers, but rather those of the politicians. ","While the Tariff of 1842 meant to protect the American cotton textile industry, it was not as effective in its actual application. Isaac Hazard asked what the practical effect of the tariff had been, because he had not seen any results from it.  At the time, in comparison to the price of equivalent fabric in Great Britain, domestic fabric in the United States cost twenty percent more.  Despite this, it must be noted that without the tariff many American textile companies would not have survived.  This is because the United State's industry was technologically behind Great Britain's. So, Isaac Hazard's complaint to his boss was largely a lost one, in that while textile prices could have been better than they were there was a cap on how much they could improve.

In his correspondence to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, Farragut mentioned the increasing number of Confederate deserters he and his men picked up from gunboats. The Union used these men for intelligence, however inaccurate, and continued to take them on in hopes of gaining new information. ","Union naval vessels took up more and more deserters as the war progressed. This symbolized a significant flaw in the Confederate cause. By 1865, as much as ten percent of the total Confederate forces had deserted their posts. In numbers, this totaled 104,000 men. In spite of initial zealous enthusiasm, as conditions worsened, soldiers struggled to maintain their drive for the cause. The Confederate government could no longer meet the needs of its soldiers. They could not pay, clothe, or feed their men adequately, and people deserted in response. Throughout the South, men wrote home to their wives lamenting their condition. In addition to having poor supplies themselves, men worried about their wives at home with their farms and slaves. As the war endured, men increasingly abandoned the Confederacy to protect themselves and their families. ","Another possible explanation for the increased desertion can be seen in the conscription of most of the Confederate army after 1862.

Harrington, CSA of Franklin County, Mississippi. It seems Mrs. Jones, most likely a widow at the time of her writing (note that it was she and not her veteran husband who penned the request), had been unable to secure the pension entitled to her by state law as the widow of a Confederate soldier. Although, according to Joanna Short, the most common reasons for this were failure to provide sufficient evidence of military service, disability, or poverty, it seems Mrs. Jones was simply having trouble with the paper work; as most people not directly affiliated with armed forces or government usually were (and still are), she had, up until the time of her writing, been stumped as to the proper procedure for filling out the proper forms and thereby obtaining the proper compensation. To this end, she sought the assistance of Major Harrington.","Mrs. Jones' case was not uncommon during the time period. During the period after the Civil War, many states began giving benefits to families of those killed during the conflict. With the backing of the Federal Government, the practice was most prevalent and more generous in the North, as the northern states could better afford to compensate families, but southern states also adopted the practice. Originally, pensions were afforded only to war widows, or wounded soldiers with variable extent of... disability, from 5 per year for the loss of a finger or toe to 150 per year for the loss of two or more limbs or total blindness. Then, according to the U.S. Government National Archives, Mississippi began granting pensions to indigent Confederate veterans or their widows in 1888. In other words, now any veteran who was down on their luck could be compensated, even if the reasons for their hard times were unrelated to the Civil War. ","The reasons for this expansion of benefits, according to Theda Skocpol, were mainly political, as straightforward compensation for wartime disabilities [turned] into fuel for patronage politics. The issue became so pressing nation wide that in 1882, Representative Roswell G. Horr of Michigan observed: I think it is safe to say that each member of this House receives [at least] fifty letters each week in regard to aid obtaining a pension. The subsequent bureaucracy that grew to deal with the large number of requests resulted in confusion, extravagance, and injustice, claims Judge Parry. The issue grew so large between 1880 and 1910, says Skocpol, the U.S. federal government devoted over a quarter of its expenditures to distributing pensions, which, aside from interest payments on the national debt in the early 1880s...exceeded or nearly equaled other major categories of federal spending. (This figure stands as a stumbling block for historians claiming an absence of federal involvement in social welfare before the New Deal.) ","Returning to Mississippi, Joanna Short notes that the average pension by 1910 in the state was 43.36 per year (41.08 in 1893 by a CPI conversion), and that for many Confederate veterans who struggled to earn a living because of disabilities or their widows, who did not have as much access to the work force, this amount was not trivial. It is unknown whether or not Mrs. Jones was an original war widow, in which case she would have been missing out on a great deal of money due her since 1865, or was trying to take advantage of the expansion of grants since 1888. Either way, the amount of money she would hopefully soon be receiving, with the help of the gentleman Major P.C. Harrington, would certainly help her during the economically challenging post war times in the South. The issue would be especially pressing to her, as the country had just experienced what the Hon. John W. Daniel called, in a speech before congress, the most acute stage of the panic of 1893, the result of which was a large across the board fall of prices, and the minimization of the United States financial system. This deflation and minimization most definitely affected many Mississippians. Mrs. Jones, therefore, most likely needed the help of Major Harrington as quickly as possible."],"display_date":"November 1893","search_date":"1893-11-15","locations":[{"id":7031,"lat":31.4771528974,"lng":-90.8978368524,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2848,"title":"A Sunday Snub\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-08-22","end_date":"1865-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On an August morning in Montgomery, Alabama, an elderly African-American woman found a seat in one of Montgomery's principal churches and waited for the service to begin. While she waited, however, she was...politely told that accommodations were prepared for her in another part of the building. The lady moved off quietly and took her place in the gallery. In an article in the Montgomery Advertiser the following Tuesday, the woman was excused from her decision to sit in a seat exactly suited to her mind with the dismissal that she knew no better, and probably had been told that she was as good as the whites, and entitled to as many privileges. White Montgomery citizens were beginning to realize that, in order to maintain the racial order of slavery, they would have to make sure that newly freed African-Americans, such as the lady in the church, knew their place.","One of the ways cities like Montgomery informed freedmen of the new social order were with Black Codes.

Just months after this incident in Montgomery, the Alabama constitutional convention failed to make blacks equal before the law and when the legislature reconvened on January 15, 1866, it enacted laws...to regulate the conduct of blacks. These laws effectively became the Alabama Black Codes, the laws that would form the foundation of legal segregation in Alabama.

George (D. Miss), a man Dunbar Rowland calls a life-long resident of Carroll County, began his overwhelmingly convincing speech on the Senate Floor defending the newly written Mississippi Constitution. The new constitution, according to Rowland's 1902 reflections, was drafted in order to eliminate ignorance at the ballot box, and Senator George's defense was apparently very insightful; he displayed a more intimate knowledge of the constitutions of Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut than did the Senators who represented those states, and the speech itself has been called one of the great constitutional law speeches of the Senate. Indeed, the principles that the man from Carroll laid out in his speech were subsequently validated by the United States Supreme Court in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. ","Two of the 1890 Mississippi Constitution's 285 main sections which George defended, however, have now earned historical renown: Sec. 243 establishing a uniform poll tax of two dollars, to be used in aid of the common schools, and for no other purpose, and Sec. 244 establishing a literacy test consisting of being able to read, understand, and interpret any section of the new Constitution. Although these two sections do not explicitly disenfranchise blacks and the provisions of the constitution of the State of Mississippi and the laws enacted to enforce them [were found in Williams v. Mississippi not to be] repugnant to the Fourteenth [and Fifteenth] Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the result was undoubtedly lopsided. According to William Alexander Mabry, the educational test if administered honestly [disenfranchised] about 123,334 Negroes and only 11,889 whites, leaving a white voting majority of more than 40,000 in the state instead of the existing 70,000 potential Negro majority, not to mention the fact that the Negro majority was already being repressed by bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Unfortunately, contrary to some of the official defenses of the 1890 constitution, including Senator George's, the result of disenfranchising a great number of blacks was intentional. As Rowland stated, the 1875 White Revolution in Mississippi and the subsequent years of intimidation of blacks leading up to the 1890 convention were carried out under the belief that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Even future early twentieth century Mississippi Governor James Kimble Vardaman noted, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, that there is no use to equivocate or lie about the matter. Mississippi's constitutional convention was held for no other purpose than to eliminate the nigger from politics; not the ignorant -- but the nigger. James George had fought since 1875 for this very purpose, and, despite claims of eliminating ignorance, it was in fact racial discrimination he defended before the U.S. Senate. ","Although the man from Carroll County's humble beginnings had earned him the nickname the Great Commoner, and his work in the United States Senate was valuable in aiding education and civil service reform as well as being instrumental in shaping the Sherman Antitrust Law, his staunch defense of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 left a darker legacy to the South. While he was very likely only a product of his time and environment, as well as a much larger underlying racial problem in the South and indeed the entire country, Senator James Z. George's rousing speech left what would become a permanent stain not only on the man from Carroll, but also on the entire South and United Sates as a whole, as it justified before Congress the Jim Crow system of de jure racial segregation and subjugation.

The petitioners wanted a commutation of the sentence of the black man Preston Harris, who was sentenced to be hung for arson. Harris sent fire to the jail where he was housed, though no one seemed to know if it was accidental or purposeful. All of the prisoners housed in the jail were brought out to safety, and the conflagration was put out before too much damage was done. The court ruled that for this offense, Harris should be hung. The petition requested that the sentence be changed from hanging to life imprisonment since the prisoner was only 17 years old. It was obviously a clear case of guilt, but many people felt that it was too harsh for such a young man, even if he was black. "," There are many examples in Southern history of whites (and blacks as well) petitioning for blacks to be granted mercy in regards to very harsh sentences in the Virginia penal system. Historically, petitions were an important part of the American legal system, and citizens actively used this right to redress grievances and plead for mercy, especially with regards to criminals. This collective action allowed the general population to have a say in the specific roles of their government. However, it is not typical for whites to take such specific action for a black man. It was not unknown however, as can be seen throughout Virginia history. For example, in the case of Angela Barnett in 1793, Angela appealed to have her death sentence pardoned since she was with child. With this appeal and the help of petitions from white friends, that sentence was pardoned. While whites may find blacks dangerous as a whole, individual blacks were their friends. In this way, whites saw Harris as an individual person, who was unjustly sentenced, not as a part of the threatening black masses. While the specifics of the case are unknown, it is clear that whites in Southside Virginia saw the injustice of such a harsh sentence for someone so young.

One month earlier, Jefferson Davis had been inaugurated as the new president of the Confederacy. Elizabeth Saxon traveled to Montgomery, Alabama to celebrate the inauguration of Davis and then traveled to Mobile when Lincoln was inaugurated. In Mobile, she visited with a good friend and mentor from her childhood, Madame Octavia Walton Invert. Well-educated and charming, Madame Invert was a woman of society. Saxon described her as the most generous person she had ever met. The two exchanged formalities and then discussed Lincoln's present inauguration with sadness and fear. Invert cried for the friends she had scattered throughout the North and the South and knew how difficult the upcoming months would be. Saxon was younger and saw more hope for the future. Yet the depression of her role model was greatly troubling, and the somber mood quickly spread to Elizabeth herself. ","Uncertainty surrounded Lincoln's inauguration. Unionists and Confederates found themselves unsure of what would happen next. His inauguration speech needed to alleviate fears and explain his positions and possible actions. In his speech, Lincoln proclaimed that his purpose was not to eliminate slavery but rather oversee that which belonged to the government. In this sense, he was referring to the states that had already seceded. This included Saxon's home state of Alabama, which had seceded on January 11, 1861. Lincoln argued that he had no intentions of ending slavery in the South, but simply wanted to preserve the Union. ","Despite Lincoln's reassurances, southerners were not convinced. Many believed that slavery could not be protected in the current Union regardless of who was in charge. States that had already seceded continued to encourage border states to join their new nation. Even though states like Alabama had already taken action, no one knew what Lincoln's response would be. When he refused to sit idly by and allow the South to create its own nation, war became the next possible step. While the border states did not seceded until April and May, the rest of the South knew that war was coming. Unlike the inauguration of Jefferson Davis, the inauguration of Lincoln was a somber occasion. Invert's wisdom led her to believe that war between the North and the South was next and that would mean great casualties on both sides. Though younger, Saxon realized a great deal from watching the depression Invert faced. She too came to believe that the Confederate States of America would have to fight to preserve themselves. Lincoln could not say anything to convince the southern states that he would fairly handle the institution of slavery.

One white man and five black men were killed. Each side blamed the other for starting the riot. Its repercussions sent shockwaves through the state of Virginia, especially with the November elections so close at hand. In response to the Danville riot, Governor William Mahone sent out a public statement on his views of the Danville riot. Mahone blamed the bourbon managers (referring to the bourbon democrats) for provoking the collision. He claimed the violence was done to intimidate black people and hurt the cause of his Readjuster Party. He explained how United States troops had been requested since the state militia was so biased against blacks in dealing with the violence. The statement was clearly political, as he blamed his political enemies for the violence. "," The late nineteenth century was plagued with political upheaval, especially in the South, as Southerners searched for a postbellum identity. The Readjuster Party was a third party that had an important influence in Virginia politics. The party gave substantial power to blacks and was based on equality for all. The party wanted to lift the state debt and therefore cut many civil service programs. It rejected the radicalism of both the Republicans and the Bourbon Democrats, who were an extreme wing of the Democrat that resisted the compromises that the Democrats were trying to make. With the November elections approaching, the violence in Danville was the result of frustration on the part of whites because of the increase political mobilization and power of blacks. The failure of a black man to show respect to a white man was the catalyst, and the violence caused the situation to spin out of control. This reaction of violence to the perceived arrogance of negroes was typical throughout the South, as the practice of lynching indicates. It also reflected an intense sense of honor that was prevalent throughout the South. Through violence, whites kept blacks in their place and protected a sense of order. Blacks were given little opportunity to express their grievances, since the law was so often on the side of whites.

He showed a masterful display of personal strength as he denied his brother-in-law, Henry Cheatham's, bid for a fifth straight nomination. John Fields had appointed a credentials committee that favored Cheatham, just as he had done in 1894, although this time Fields would not actually serve on the committee but rather was the chairman. White came from behind to prevent the Field's second attempt to fix the credentials process in favor of Cheatham. The convention lasted until around one o'clock in the morning when delegates overwhelmingly nominated White as their choice. Although White would face an experienced incumbent Democrat in the fall, the spring of 1896 Republican convention was the first one since 1890 to exhibit Republican unity.","White had gained the respect that put him in the position to be elected because of his dedicated service as the Solicitor since 1886. He was elected to the United States Congress in the elections of 1896 over incumbent Frederick A. Woodard and was again elected by the Second District in 1898. Although the Republican Party increasingly garnered a label as the black party and Democrats charged white Republicans as traitors to their race, White quickly became almost as popular in his party outside the state as he was at home in North Carolina. After the disputed 1894 elections, the state enacted changes which guaranteed the protection of minority voters and produced a voter turnout of more than 85% of all eligible voters in North Carolina, including an estimated 87% of black voters. In total, there was an estimated 330,000 votes cast, a 20% increase from the 1892 elections and the Republicans and Populists carried the state in all but one congressional district. Unfortunately, this trend would not hold in North Carolina and throughout the South.","White's nomination and later election to Congress was significant as it occurred in the face of a growing movement toward the disfranchisement of blacks. He was the last black Congressman elected in the South but chose against seeking a third term in the elections of 1900 as the North Carolina Democrats changed the laws, intimidating blacks from voting. After White, there were no African Americans elected to Congress for the next 28 years. Beginning in 1890, southern states invoked literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and white primaries to prevent many blacks from voting. Lynching and race riots also began to occur more frequently. In addition, in March 1891, the General Assembly decided to drastically redesign the North Carolina Second District, removing three black-majority counties, Jones, Vance, and Craven, from the Second District and redistributing them to areas dominated by the white Democrats. This forced White, a native of Craven County, to move to Edgecombe where he could once again run as a delegate for the Second District, the only district where he would have a chance of defeating a Democrat. Benjamin Justesen argued that in the face of this growing movement, the North Carolina elections of 1896 were significant because many considered them to be the state's fairest election since Reconstruction."],"display_date":"May 13, 1896","search_date":"1896-05-13","locations":[{"id":9436,"lat":35.9129129092,"lng":-77.5970968689,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2891,"title":"The Cross of Gold\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-11-05","end_date":"1896-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On November 5, 1891, in its Alliance Department, The Jackson Weekly Clarion Ledger published the Farmers' Alliance main agricultural ideas.  The central issue on the page, however, had nothing to do with crops, but had entirely to do with silver.  Indeed, under a section labeled Alliance Principles and Demands, the first demand was unlimited silver coinage, or certificates based on silver.","Since the 1870s, the Alliance had, no doubt, had much concern over the silver issue.  The passage of The Coinage Act of 1873 and the Resumption Act of 1875 (full resumption of convertibility of paper money into gold, and vice versa, occurring in 1879), the United States returned to a commodity monetary standard as in pre-Civil War times, with the only difference being that silver was omitted and the standard was entirely a gold standard.  According to Milton Friedman, the most obvious, but by no means the most important, consequence of the U.S. return to gold rather than to a bimetallic standard was the sharp rise in the gold-silver price ratio.  A far more important consequence was the effect on the nominal prices of goods and services in general.  The increased world demand for gold...coincided with a slowing in the rate of increase of the world's stock of gold and a rising output of goods and services.  The result of these economic factors was deflation from 1875 to 1896, at a rate of roughly 1.7 percent a year in the United States...[with] the wholesale prices of agricultural and other basic commodities [falling] at a greater rate (3.0 percent a year by one index).  ","In the latter part of the 1800s, this deflation became a serious concern for farmers in the United States, including those in Mississippi, as it exacerbated the ongoing problems with sharecropping and foreign competition. Deflation affected the farmers of Mississippi, as farmers are affected both by the falling prices (the things they are selling are worth less at the market) and also the rise in the real value of their debt (most farmers are debtors, meaning simply that they must borrow money to prepare their farm before they can hopefully sell enough products at harvest time to make a profit and pay off their loans).  As the Mississippi Historical Society states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from 1870 to 1897, wheat prices fell from 1.06 a bushel to 63c a bushel, corn from 43c to 30c a bushel, and cotton from 15c a pound to 6c a pound. Most of the time farmers received even less for their produce.  The Historical Society blames over production, which may be true, but the overarching reason for this deflation was the monometallic standard.  Especially following 1890, deflation worsened and gave rise to the pro-silver politicians of the 1890s.  Because of the large farming constituency in Mississippi, these politicians were very popular in the State.  Such politicians supported returning to a bimetallic standard in order to ease the deflation and help American farmers (and sellers of silver), thus causing the State Alliance of Mississippi to publish in support of silver and agriculture in 1891.  ","The most influential silver politician of the 1890s was William Jennings Bryan, a Silver-Democrat (as opposed to a Gold Democrat) from Nebraska.  Bryan was especially popular in the strongly agricultural regions of the South, including Mississippi, and West.  Indeed, the Jackson Clarion Ledger repeatedly showered him with praise:  On July 9, 1896, the paper stated, in anticipation of the upcoming Democratic National Convention, that Mr. Bryan...is a finished orator with a resonant voice and command presence.  On October 15, 1896, the Clarion Ledger stated that Bryan is making the most wonderful canvass ever known in this country with his many speaking trips.  With these reports, the Ledger is reflecting his popularity with the farmers of Mississippi and the entire South.","In typical fashion, according to Friedman, William Jennings Bryan mesmerized the crowd at the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his now famous speech, in which he declared you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.  His speech has been called probably the most effective speech in the history of American party politics.  Bryan eventually won and accepted the Democratic nomination for President.  ","Although his platform had many other facets, which were outlined in his acceptance letter published in the Clarion Ledger on September 17, 1896, a bimetallic monetary standard and the free coinage of silver were always his main speaking points.  These points, however, began to lose ground during his campaign due to advances in gold extraction processes made by Scottish Chemists resulting in the beginnings of inflation.  Unfortunately for the Farmers' Alliance in Mississippi, Bryan's other platform stances were not strong enough for him to defeat William McKinley.  According to The World Almanac Encyclopedia of 1897, he ended up losing the election by 100 electoral votes and 603,514 popular votes.  As typical of the South and West, however, Bryan won 63,859 out of 71,184 votes in Mississippi, or slightly under 90 percent.  Election result maps show that McKinley was absolutely dominated in the region, excluding California, Oregon, and Washington.  Bryan's domination was due to the large farming and ranching constituencies in those areas, as well as, according to Richard Bensel, strong silver areas in such areas as Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah.

James Hopkins Adams was certainly aware of the tumult he caused with that short declaration. A former governor of South Carolina from 1854 to 1856, Adams was, in December 1860, serving as a commissioner to the committee discussing the possibility of secession and civil war in South Carolina. His remarks caused Charleston resident Emma Holmes, in a December 5, 1860, letter to her friend Lizzie Greene in Georgia, to declare, Last Sunday will never be forgotten by the Charlestonians. The Convention was sitting. The Governor was holding a council of war. Troops were marching in the streets. The Palmetto Guards (The Finest and largest company of infantry in the state) took control of the Arsenal, and subsequently a salute of thirty two guns fired to the 'fallen grandeur' of the Stars and Stripes, as they were hauled down, to give place to the banner of the glorious Palmetto State. To top it all off, it was a Sunday-the Sabbath, the day of rest, which all Charlestonians were assuredly enjoying in a peaceful, leisurely manner, before the onslaught of troops and gun salutes. ","To be sure, all these displays were mere show, one snowballing into the next, probably unnecessarily troubling Charleston's finest ladies. Abraham Lincoln had yet to be inaugurated, had yet to call for 75,000 volunteers to stop the South from seceding, had yet to issue any other proclamations. Fort Sumter's bombardment-and with it a war-would not occur until April 1861.","But much can be said for mere show. Indeed, the state seems to have been working its way towards such displays in the several months prior. In a November 10, 1860, letter to Lizzie, Miss Holmes wrote of similar events: The report having reached Boston that South Carolina had already seceded, Mr. Caleb Cushman sent on in a vessel owned by himself and brothers, then here with orders to fire a salute of fifteen guns for the Southern States and to hoist the flag of S.C., a palmetto tree and Lone star. Though Emma was mistaken-formal secession would not occur until December 20 of that year-the multiple-gun salutes and hoistings of the Palmetto flag seemed common occurrences in the months leading up to secession. ","This episode is important in demonstrating the fact that Charlestonians were celebrating secession several months before it actually happened, a fact that should not be taken lightly. Historian Walter Edgar concurs, stating that South Carolinians had been calculating the value of the Union since the 1820s, and with each passing year, more and more found the Union wanting in the balance, a threat to the order and harmony of the state. Letters like Emma Holmes' represent the very thoughts of Charleston citizens during this time, demonstrating, as was seen a fortnight after Emma's December 6 letter, that their views were in line with those of their politicians."],"display_date":"December 5, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-05","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2926,"title":"Secession\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-20","end_date":"1860-12-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 17, 1860, a convention formed in the South Carolinian capital of Columbia to debate and confront the single most important decision facing the state since voting on independence from Great Britain over 80 years earlier. As fate would have it, the city of Charleston would be the one to hear the verdict on secession first. We, the People of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, That the Ordinance adopted by us in Convention, on the twenty-third day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General Assembly of this State, ratifying amendments of the said Constitution, are hereby repealed; and that the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states, under the name of the 'United States of America,' is hereby dissolved. The delegates had moved their convention from Columbia to Charleston due to rumors of a smallpox outbreak in Columbia. The importance of the move cannot be underestimated. As historian Walter Edgar says, There may have been one case (of smallpox) in the city, but by moving to Charleston those favoring secession would be in a locale more hospitable to their ideas. ","Among the hospitable was Emma Holmes, a young Charleston lady, who was both very agreeable to secession and willing to accept wholeheartedly the smallpox outbreak story. In writing to her friend Lizzie Green on December 20, Holmes exclaimed, The Union is dissolved, and we the people of South Carolina are a free and independent sovereignty Yesterday dear Lizzie the Ordinance of Secession passed at 1 1/4 P.M. and last night it was signed at Secession Hall (formerly Institute) amidst an immense concourse of people, and illuminations of tar barrels and fireworks of every description, music and parading of various companies. The Convention and Legislature adjourned here this week on account of the small-pox which is very prevalent in Columbia... In celebration, Frank Porcher lit 48 colored lanterns at his home on East Battery; tar barrels were burnt on Meeting Street; Roman candles and bombshells were launched throughout the city. The vote had been unanimous-all 169 delegates in favor of secession. This episode is important, of course, for the national ramifications it held. South Carolina was the first state to secede, others soon followed, with the results a new nation and civil war. But historian Ralph Wooster's data on the members of the South Carolina secession convention are far more probing. Delegates to South Carolina's secession convention held a median age of 49 years-the oldest median age of all the conventions-and were the only delegates to vote entirely for immediate secession. South Carolina delegates were also richer-with median personal property of 50,000, 18,000 more than the next closest, Mississippi-and held the most slaves-a median of 37, compared to 15.5 for Mississippi, again the next closest. Finally, 250 of the total 1,048 delegates at all conventions were born in South Carolina, and were heavily in favor of secession. ","Supporters for war in South Carolina, at least, were wealthy, older men. Perhaps the best conclusion to be drawn from this episode, then, lies in the words of Mr. Wooster: The motives for supporting immediate withdrawal from the Union seem then to have had a deeper basis than personal characteristics of convention members alone. Thus the political climate in Charleston, as this episode shows, may have contributed more to secession than mere property, age, or birthplace.

On December 6, 1850, William H. Barnwell, rector of St. Peter's Church, took the pulpit to expand upon the great political question which is agitating our country. The occasion? A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, as designated by the South Carolina legislature. The great political question? Slavery, especially in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, a compromise most South Carolinians viewed as an absolute defeat for the South. ","Barnwell was very clear on his stance: The purpose of the North is to use the whole power of the Government for its own aggrandizement, and the destruction of an institution which we believe to be of vital importance to our welfare. The institution for Barnwell, though, was not just important for South Carolina's welfare-it was ordained by God and a gift to the African race. His ultimate conclusion, though (the morality of slavery aside) remained political: Whatever speculative notions any one may have as to the moral influence of slavery, that it is a fundamental institution of the Southern States, and that no Government on earth has the slightest right to meddle with it, either directly or indirectly.","Turn to November 21, 1860. This time, South Carolina Governor William Gist had proclaimed another Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer. This time, it was Reverend Thomas Smyth lecturing at Second Presbyterian Church on The Sin and the Curse. This time, it was the election of Abraham Lincoln and a growing secession movement that prompted the occasion. It was all a foregone conclusion in Smyth's mind: This is only the result,-the consummation of a tragedy which has been long progressing to its last act,-when the curtain fell upon the dismembered body of the Union. He goes on to blame Northern Christians for this situation; they pervert truth, justice, honor, and good faith by forgetting that the condition of slavery has been and is recognized and regulated by God, who first ordained that it should come to pass as a penal infliction upon a guilty race, for the mitigation of greater evils, and for the good of all... that under the fostering care of these Southern States, and of this legally bounded institution, these people have multiplied in a ratio greater than their masters; that they are healthier and happier than any other laboring class on the face of the earth. ","This episode is important in showing the fusion of religion and politics in 1850s South Carolina. The views of these two pastors also aligned with those in the rest of the South. As Charles Iron of Elon University notes, By the 1830s, Southern whites insisted in their formulation of a regional, evangelical orthodoxy that God had ordained slavery and that slaveholders could confidently hold their property in persons so long as they were attentive to the spiritual condition of their slaves. Though these two sermons were ten years apart, the themes they espouse and the justifications for slavery they promulgate remained the same."],"display_date":"December 5, 1850 - November 21, 1860","search_date":"1855-11-28","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2929,"title":"Democratic Ratification Meeting Confirms Cleveland, Stevenson, Carr","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-07-06","end_date":"1892-07-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A New Bern ratification meeting on July 6, 1892 reflected more of a Democratic rally than a meeting as Cleveland, Carr and Victory chanted through the air in Craven County. The meeting set the Democratic ball in motion as the assembly greeted the resolution with applause and enthusiasm. Mr. Furnifold McLendel Simmons, the first speaker, championed Grover Cleveland and Adlai Stevenson as the perfect presidential pairing and presented Elias Carr and his associates on the State ticket as excellent candidates. His condemnation of the Republican and People's Party also drew tremendous applause. Mr. Stevenson followed Mr. Simmons and he too received great applause from the crowd. General Battle then spoke on behalf of the Democratic Party and mentioned how for the half century that the Democrats administered the government, the Party had secured both a reputation abroad and property at home. He said that every inch of territory that had been acquired by the United States, except Alaska, resulted from the efforts of the Democrats' administration. During this period, the Democrats had humbled both England and Mexico, along with the savage Indian tribes, until the Republicans broke the constitution and forced the South to choose from inequality in the Union or independence out of it. He claimed that the Union, led by the Republicans, made the war within the States inevitable. Finally, General Battle argued that Cleveland's administration would restore the South to her position as a sovereign state of the Union.","Grover Cleveland went on to win the presidential election of 1892, becoming the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms, his first being from 1885-1889. Adlai Stevenson served as his vice-president and Elias Carr became the Democratic governor of North Carolina from 1893-1897. Democrats viewed these victories as the triumph of old values over those implemented during Reconstruction. Cleveland was the only Democrat to be elected during the Republican reign of 1860-1912.","This narrative displays the rebuilding of Democratic politics in the South in the 1890s. Michael Perman argued that disfranchisement, including poll taxes, white primaries, and grandfather clauses was an attempt to skirt the 15th Amendment and restore white domination in the South. The Republicans had controlled the government for the Reconstruction era but by the 1890s, the Democrats were intent on again controlling their home and their land.

Mitthoff's son went after the slaves and attempted to bring back the cart and other items.When leaving the camp he was asked to show his passports.  He was then told that General Phelps wanted him to leave much of what the young Mitthoff had taken.  Mitthoff's son wound up leaving the camp empty-handed.  When father and son reconvened they witnessed their slaves beating their mule with sticks and throwing mud at it.  The mule then charged towards Mitthoff's carriage, in which his children were sitting.  Mitthoff had to run in front of the raging mule in order to protect his children, which resulted in a terrible injury to his foot.  ","Coinciding with Union occupation, the proportion of runaway slaves increased dramatically in Louisiana.  As soon as slaves figured out where they could go to attain freedom, they left their plantations whenever the opportunity arose.  Confederates knew that when Federal troops arrived they were bound to lose large numbers of slaves.  Therefore, practices monitoring and controlling slaves were magnified in order to prevent the huge loss of capital resulting from runaway slaves.  Parishes hired permanent guards and created river patrols to stop slaves from escaping.  Prior to the war slaves could live unaccompanied in cities, but once the Federal troops arrived masters were fined for allowing slaves to be on their own.  The state paid to have extra white men monitor plantations that did not have enough supervision.  There was also an increase in the amount of Negro hunters who were compensated for retrieving runaway slaves.  Confederates sensed the danger that Union troops brought to the system of slavery and did everything within their power to control the system they were willing to die for.  Not only would runaway slaves hinder the southern economic system, they also were likely to join the Union army.

Gooch wrote a letter in the winter of 1825 on the issue of slaveholding in Virginia and the South. Gooch believed that the subject of slaveholding states rights' was not getting enough attention from southern politicians. Throughout the letter Gooch argued against the intrusive interference of our northern neighbors on that of slaves, saying that they knew nothing of the cultural state of things among us [the South]. He also argued that there is little difference in the state of African-Americans in the north and the south, except that of political rights, which were hardly rights in the north. Slaves had better lives than their poor northern brethren, he stated. Gooch did not defend slavery's virtues in this letter; instead he argued against the north forcing its ways upon the south. He even stated that the southern states themselves are affording a devise gradually to get rid of the evil [slavery], but that they were doing it their way, on their time. At the end of his letter, he focused on the independence of Virginia as a state, and that as such the state has its own rights to run things the way it sees fit, under its own timetable."," In this letter much is seen about the way Virginians thought of the institution of slavery in the first half of the nineteenth century. While slavery in the inner-city of Richmond was not embraced as it was in much of the plantation south, Virginians still defended their right to have it everywhere, and resented the northern states attempting to end it. Gooch's statement that the northerners know nothing of the state of things in the south (and that slaves were better off than their northern counterparts) showed that southerners in Virginia honestly have believed that their institution of slavery was not in fact the evil it was made out to be. At the end of his letter, Gooch's emphasis on Virginia as a state and the rights that it thus had foreshadowed the Civil War that was still over thirty years away. The attitude that the northern states could not tell the southern states what to do, specifically with regard to slavery, would eventually be a key factor in dividing the country and leading to war. This would be very important in Virginia, a border state in the North-South conflict. Here these feelings of state's rights showed up long before anyone could even have imagined an event on the scale of the Civil War taking place.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

The purpose of this convention-the largest body of the kind which has ever been held in Georgia - was to nominate Whig Party candidates for Congress, a candidate for the 1844 Georgia gubernatorial race, and delegates to represent the Georgia Whig Party at the 1844 Whig National Convention in Baltimore. At the very beginning of the convention, the delegates unanimously adopted the following resolution: Resolved, That many of the evils which afflict our people, can be traced directly to the injurious and ruinous legislation of the few last years; and believing the success of the Whig Party is essential to remedy this state of things, we conjure our friends to bring out their strongest and best men for the Legislature, in the several counties of the State.","The Whigs had recently experienced several setbacks, so this Convention was especially important if the party hoped to regain its political strength. The Whigs had just elected their first president, William Henry Harrison, but he died unexpectedly one month into his term. Vice President John Tyler renounced his Whig affiliation and loyalty after his presidential inauguration, as a result of the ideological and power clashes between Tyler, Henry Clay, and Whig leadership. As suggested by the Convention's adopted resolution, the Whigs were also upset by the current Georgia administration's Democratic policies, as the two parties were increasingly and irreconcilably polarized; the Whigs favored protectionist policies over the Democrats' free trade, and they favored economic development and diversification over economic growth. The Georgia Whigs themselves were also increasingly divided over national issues, including slavery and the state's right to secede from the Union. ","The Convention ultimately nominated George W. Crawford for governor and Alexander H. Stephens for a seat in the House of Representatives. Both men won the respective elections. Eight Georgia Whigs were nominated for the National Whig Convention in 1844, where they would serve as delegates and vote for Henry Clay as the Presidential nominee and John McPherson Berrien, the elected president of the Georgia convention, as the Vice Presidential nominee. After the convention, <em>The Recorder</em>, a Milledgeville newspaper supporting the Whig and States' Rights Ticket, congratulated the delegates on prioritizing the selection of strong, promising candidates across the board, rather than focusing on the nominees that they personally favored.

This degrading act of vigilante violence was initiated to control; mainly African-Americans in a predominantly white society. A response article was written to the African-American Ledger, a black operated newspaper in Baltimore, rebuking these despicable acts towards a fellow human being. A spark was ignited when earlier; two black men from a nearby county were hung according to mob law. Though the reasons for their death are not stated in the article, the readers would want to infer that the blacks committed some irreconcilable act. On the other hand, Brundage would assert that it really did not take a reason for some whites to be vigilant. Simply walking by, they were able to create a false reality, and persecute an innocent black on their reasons. Readers would moreover hope that the real judicial process was carried out to the fullest extent, free from rash actions of the victim's community. In reaction, Gov. Clarke condemned these acts and offered a maximum reward of 200 for information regarding those who commit lynchings.","It seems that toward the end of the 19th century, when lynching peaked, perhaps the public was becoming apprehensive with the course of society. Lynching was considered a solution to an increasingly integrated society. Whites felt that the growing crime rate in cities and towns were due to the renegade nature of the African-American community. To reconcile weak local governments, and preserve their way of life, a method was developed to punish those who crossed societal boundaries. This example explicitly illustrates the use of newspaper as a medium for citizens to voice their concern or contentment with these particularly brutal measures. As years progressed, more articles and debates were focused on this situation in the South. If modernization was ever to occur, the populace needed to recognize their error in their judgment to break the law in such an inhumane manner by tying a rope to a tree. More and more, progress was being made in the country with regards to technology and medicine. However, many believed that it was time for change to occur within the mindset of its citizenry. ","A more interesting question to ask is why would lynching become a predominant response to society's troubles? Due to weak institutional forces, poverty, and poor education, these factors instilled a superior attitude among whites. These sentiments thus failed to create a respect for law and fellow humans. Disgust was brewing among citizens for having to experience others tantalizing another race. The symbol was contradictory to the ideals of modernization and humanitarianism.

In Fluvanna County, a black man named William Holly stole the bacon and other property belonging to a white woman named Beverly Haden. Haden pressed charges for the offense, and the accused stood trial for his crimes, and was found guilty. After emancipation, trials involving free blacks in the South were often conducted carefully to avoid the possibility of being accused of any impropriety due to racial bias. ","When writing the report of the trial proceedings, Captain Frank P. Cranton, Attorney General Manager of that district, made sure to emphasize the complete fairness of the proceedings: The evidence and the prisoner's confession were strongly against him. The examination was fairly constructed. Colored evidence properly taken into consideration and every point of law contested in the prisoner's favor but his legal adviser Thomas H. Tuttwiler, one of the most responsible and best lawyers of the county. The proceedings throughout were conducted with all fairness, and no white citizen could have had a more impartial hearing. ","Often in cases of theft or other relatively minor infractions with recently freed blacks as the defendants a certain amount of condescending leniency was granted. The officers of the court regularly assumed that because of the short time that had passed since the defendant had even become a citizen, they could not be expected to be cognizant of the laws of the land. In her book <em>Dixie After the War</em>, Myrta Lockett Avery writes that The new manners of the blacks were painful, revolting, absurd. The freedman's misbehavior was to be condoned only by pity that accepted his inferiority as excuse. However condescending this attitude was, it may have had some merit, although it could just as easily be argued that even former slaves were aware that stealing was against the law. Either way, it definitely worked in the favor of the free blacks who stood trial.","This obsession with propriety and fairness was belied by the still-racist nature of the courts. In the document, Holly is identified as col'd (or colored), while Haden, a white woman, needed no racial identification at all. In his dissertation, James Douglas Smith writes about the sense of responsibility that whites in Virginia often felt towards freed blacks when it came to helping them navigate through the systems to which they had not been exposed prior to their freedom. Although this is of course not overwhelmingly true, as violence and racial tension comprised a large part of post-Civil War society all over the South, examples of white southerners displaying degrees of kindness, understanding, and paternalistic attitudes towards the newly-freed blacks can be found.

As the Superintendent lined the convicts up to march back to the Dade County coal mines for another day of exhausting labor, one group refused to move. At the head of a long line of men chained together, the leader of the rebellion spoke up to Colonel Tower. He said that he and all the rest of the men from his stockade refused to work another day in the heat at their awful work. He defied the Superintendent to shoot them down- they were prisoners for life anyway and nothing could be worse than what they were set to do. ","Faced with such a situation, Colonel Tower immediately informed Governor McDaniel. Alarmed at the prospect of a rebellion and a breakdown in the convict lease system, Governor McDaniel ordered out the military and held them ready to intervene if necessary. After some consideration, Colonel Tower decided that the best way to control this outburst of Senator Joe Brown?s leased convicts was to starve them out. Feeling comfortable with the measures taken to guard the compound of stockades and with the presence of military backup, Tower put his method into action. Forty-eight hours later, the convicts were still without food, and the residents of nearby Cole City were fearful of vengeful attack. Colonel Tower stood by the stockade with the inmates inside all night. He tried persuasion and threats, keeping a conversation going with the convicts. By daybreak, the rebels were hungry-and a few of them were hungrier than the rest. These few decided that they wanted to surrender, that they had had enough. Their fellow convicts immediately set upon them physically, upset with their actions. Despite this show of force on the part of the rebellion?s leaders, the sentiments of the few soon spread to the rest. By the end of that day, all save one of the rebels had surrendered the cause. ","This episode is indicative of the perils of the southern convict lease system in the post-war period. As historian Mark Carleton notes, this plentiful source of cheap labor was irresistible to southern state governments with prison management problems. Indeed all southern states used the system after the 1870s. This episode indicates the support politicians gave the system because the leases were a source of state revenue at the same time as they eliminated the drain on the state to house and feed criminals. As evidenced in the protests of these convicts in Dade County, the workers were poorly fed and cared-for and suffered physical abuse by those overseeing their work. Carleton makes the point that as convicted criminals, no one was concerned for their well-being. Thus, when conditions became unbearable, they had to speak up for themselves. Indeed, the terrible conditions described by the convicts here appear to historians today to been a very like those under slavery in the antebellum south.

On August 4, 1840, six members of the Whig Central Committee of Vigilance of Fauquier, R.E Scott, Samuel Chilton, Tho's T. Withers, Richards Payne, John P. Philips, and John Walden, invited the voters of Fauquier and surrounding counties to attend a Whig party meeting in Warrenton.  The men made it clear that the invitation was not limited only to those aligned with the Whigs, by telling members of all parties as well as their Van Buren 'friends' to COME  At the meeting they intended to present the citizens with the opportunity to discuss the topics connected with the upcoming Presidential Election and develop and explain the principles that created the basis for Whig political actions.  The Whigs held their first national convention in December of 1939, which helped to develop them into a National Party.  Smaller Whig meetings, like the one held in Warrenton, were the reason the party moved forward organizationally and developed firm ideologies during the Presidential Election of 1840.  The election was defined by Southern ideals, seeing that Whig candidate, William Henry Harrison, was a native Virginian, and Democrat candidate, President Martin Van Buren, was strongly against abolition and had an unwavering friendship with the South.  The Southern ties both of these candidates had caused two party politics to become strongly established in the South, as there was a split among party lines.  Historian William J. Cooper makes this clear in saying that, Each party stressed its claim to be the protector of Southern interests and accused the other of infidelity in those interests.  Despite these similar interests, the Whigs and Harrison were victories in the election, carrying seven slave states, and winning more than half of the popular vote below Mason Dixon line.  After the election, the close competition between the two parties continued, each claiming to be the 'champion of the South.' Close competition made party cohesiveness in small counties and communities, like that shown in Fauquier, more and more important for party victories.

He reported that he had expected to receive a letter from her while in Monroe, Georgia but after waiting there longer than he intended, he still had not heard from her.

During the antebellum period, as in other times during United States history, there was much disagreement about how strong the government should be.

These developments included the postal service itself as well as the railroads, roads and canals that facilitated the ease and efficiency of sending mail. The slow and unpredictable postal system that was experienced by James Stratton in 1835 was in part a result of the reluctance of Americans, in particular southerners, to put enough power in the hands of the government that it could fund and create efficient and effective infrastructure systems."],"display_date":"July 14, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-14","locations":[{"id":2188,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2998,"title":"Systematic Volunteer Work and Grassroots Efforts in Fairhope\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The desire to awaken the noble impulses of humanity and to reform society along socioeconomic lines was something that the founders of Fairhope had as specific goals, outlined by the single tax principle. Just like other progressive movements at the time in the South though, the ideals blueprinted by the intellectuals could not be . In January of 1897 nearly all the members of the Fairhope community agreed to give from 8am to 12 noon on first and third Saturdays for public work. They agreed to receive compensation other than the results of their labor and the satisfaction of having performed a public duty. In another town this might suggest that the town was in a desperate position and relied on its citizens to accomplish public projects.

Rives did not agree with a measure recommended by the Virginia Legislature.  At the time it was common understanding that federal senators should comply with instructions from legislatures because they were chosen by legislatures.  Senator Rives stance against the legislature brought him criticism from the people of Virginia, most notably those of the Republican Party, which Senator Rives was a member of.  In response to the criticism, a man under the pseudonym of Hector wrote a letter to the Republicans of Fauquier County that defended Senator Rives.  The letter argued that the criticisms he was receiving from the people of Fauquier echoed the views of Monarchists, not those of the Republican Party.  Hector asked the people of Fauquier: Has he forsaken any of those cardinal principles of the republican creed, which lie at the foundation of our government?  To this he responded: No one would say that he has.  This supported his argument that centered on the fact that the U.S Government gave senators the right to disagree with the 'Executive' in order to keep their decisions in check.  He then went on to say, if this process was not allowed then U.S might as well have a Grand Sultan for chief Magistrate, eluding to the way the people's criticisms advocated a monarchy. Senator Rives ultimately resigned due the criticisms and lack of support he received from his party as a result of his decision.  Whether this conflict should have ended in his resignation is questionable.  The defense that Hector gives in the episode echoes the views of the Whig Party at the time, which looked to uphold the Constitution.  They viewed the practice of Senators following the instruction of the legislature as a threat to the Constitution.  If this were the case then Rives should not have resigned.  However, if extreme Republican doctrine, which acknowledged that senators were responsible to the will of their states and therefore should follow the instructions of their legislature, was staunchly upheld then Rives would have seen reason to resign.  The people of Fauquier most clearly agreed with the Republican view, seeing that they were being addressed with a presentation of the opposite view.On February 10, 1834, the Whig majority in the Virginia legislature instructed senators to use their best exertions to make their own decision on the issue at hand, which related to the controversy over the removal of the deposits from the Second Bank of the United States.

Their goal, under the guidance of their president, Rev. Howard Hyde Russell, was to unify the anti-alcohol sentiment already brewing in society and to enact further legislation to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. Grounded in moral and religious ideals, the movement was able to spread information via pamphlets, newspapers, and the spoken word. Originating in Ohio, the American temperance organization was able to flow southward, slowly encompassing a nation. ","An article written in the Washington Post in 1897 exemplifies the efforts made by the organization to illustrate their cause and purpose throughout society.

The Washington D.C. area, with 15 temperance organizations, convened with the Montgomery, Maryland County League seeking greater cooperation. The article made it seem relatively easy. However, the J.C. Jackson understood that the league struggled at first due to organizational and financial difficulties. Besides discussing organizational problems, the meeting conferred about the actions taken by members to badger grocers who profited from alcohol-related sales. The President was then authorized to appoint a committee whose purpose was to prepare a list of all grocers who recently received a liquor license. This was essential to the cause of the Anti-Saloon League. They wanted sales to cease, thus patronizing liquor salesperson was one of many necessary tactics incorporated. Such agitation meetings were usually held on Sunday with official leaders present. In 1908, there were at least 15,000 meetings.

Church and political leaders believed that a large portion of societal problems, such as poverty, sickness, and crime were heavily due to alcohol. Due to the help of the evangelicals, Protestants, and Republican party, prohibition laws were able to be ratified. The Anti-Saloon League as well as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were able to gain local and state wide option laws in most states; finally culminating in 1919 with the passage of the 18th Amendment. Prohibition dealt with humanizing institutions to adhere to newfound prized values and traditions. The southern ethos of the 20th century hurt the liquor industry doing the prohibition era.

Wayne from the United States House of Representatives, the Jacksonian Party of Georgia desired a strong unionist to represent the Milledgeville Congressional District in Congress.  On July 6, 1835, a convention of Union Party delegates nominated Jabez Jackson to fill this void.   Jabez Jackson himself wrote to the Central Committee of the Union Party of Milledgeville a letter of informal inauguration and thanks.  The <em>Georgia Telegraph </em>published the letter in its paper the next day. Jackson outlined his own history by paralleling it with the history of his proud state.  At the age of 17, Jackson fought alongside a Georgia regiment in the American Revolution.  Later in life, he continued serving the state in civil and military matters.  After thanking the Committee and accepting the nomination, he then turned to the heart of his address: the sacred cause of his party and thus the sacred cause of the Union. The cause of his party was simple: to maintain the strength, unity, and integrity of the United States.  His scorn quickly turned to his fellow Congressmen from South Carolina who stood for nullification and the State Rights party, so called.  He claimed that these representatives would be mocked by the Founding Fathers from their state, who would not be eager to exchange the glories of the Star Spangled Banner for the mock heroics of the Palmetto Button.  The members of the States Rights Party of the Palmetto State, as South Carolina was lovingly called by its citizens, often placed their state's autonomy over that of the nation.  Jackson scornfully mocked their allegiance to their state in contrast with the Founders' allegiance to the Union.","Instead of standing steadfast for states rights, Jackson defended the noble institutions of our country and its rich history and constitution.  This, he claimed, is the debt he owed to the heritage of Georgia.  A few short years after the Nullification Crisis and 22 years before the Civil War, this Congressman from the Black Belt of Georgia left no doubt where he stood in the brooding sectional conflicts of the era. The Nullification Crisis and the call for states rights divided much of the South in the mid-1830s.  Under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, Congress passed a law that President Jackson signed in 1832 creating protective tariffs over certain manufactured goods from Europe.  These tariffs pushed prices on manufactured goods from abroad above the rates of the same goods from the North, guaranteeing that the South would buy these products from the North rather than from Europe and thus help the economy of the North and of the nation.","South Carolina's bold stance against the federal tariffs placed upon certain manufactured goods also came at a time when Andrew Jackson was busy piecing together a national party.  In fact, the President called his party the Union Party as a symbolic gesture of national harmony and unison at a time of bubbling regional conflicts like the Nullification Crisis.  Unlike later fire eaters of the Deep South who stood for secession and absolute state rights in the face of Unionism, Jabez Jackson and other Union Party members sought to support Georgia by remaining united to the nation during times of sectional conflict.  Unionists like Jabez Jackson remained loyal to the Union rather than the debated rights of their own states in following conflicts such as the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act that seemed to threaten the integrity of the Union.  This Unionist sentiment remained largely prevalent until the late 1850s and early 1860s as war eventually broke out between the North and South."],"display_date":"July 7, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-07","locations":[{"id":1523,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3043,"title":"Blacks in South Carolina: Education and Christianization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-01-01","end_date":"1834-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Several members of South Carolina's Chester County delivered a petition to the state assembly in response to an 1834 act outlawing teaching reading to slaves. The citizens expressed outrage at the legislation, saying themselves and other citizens were prepared to disobey the law because slaves across Southern plantations already had the ability to read. They further expressed their opinion that the law would not be enforced in the state, except in cases of malicious and spiteful intent on some slaveholders' parts to punish men better than themselves. The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance. They argued that general ignorance within the slave population is more of a threat because it would make slaves much more susceptible to the influences of any Nat Turner type character that might pass through the region. The petition ended with the scornful question does chivalrous South Carolina quail before gangs of cowardly Africans with a Bible in their hands?","    Despite the moral and Christian basis of this petition, this appeal and many others like it were continually rejected by the state legislators. According to historian Walter Edgar, South Carolina was known across the antebellum South as the most stringent state with regards to teaching blacks, both free and enslaved. However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon. This episode is an excellent illustration of the different pressures felt by white Southerners throughout the antebellum period: recognizing slaves as human souls entitled to the same rights as whites versus slaves as commodities upholding the economic and cultural basis of Southern culture."],"display_date":1834,"search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":11463,"lat":34.6920570183,"lng":-81.1595343266,"zoom":10,"place":"CHESTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3048,"title":"Picnic for Family, Friends, and Politicians","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-09-23","end_date":"1894-09-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Frederick, Maryland, once again, demonstrates its political prowess by holding a political picnic and barbeque for the surrounding areas political parties. Held at the New Market, members of the two major political parties, the Republican and Democratic Party, as well as family and friends attended the community-sanctioned event. Political candidates were at the political picnic to discuss the community's pressing issues as well as the new tariff reform policy. Col. L.V. Baughran, presided and introduced the picnics guest which included one nominee for Congress, and two representatives currently serving. The guest list included many prominent society members such as professors and aristocrats, who traveled considerable distance to attend the event. ","The picnic serves an extremely pivotal socialization function. Great cooks come to serve their specialty to the attendees of 500 or more, able to see friends you are unable to see due to distance, and the chance to meet influential politicians and discuss matters of the heart. For this reason, these political functions serve a major social role. While the kids play with the other children, you are able to hear contrasting views regarding a subject. That's right. Either if one political party set up the picnic, often, invited or not, the other political parties seeking influence in the area, come to deliver their side of the discussion. This sets up the sight for a potential debate. Both sides believed that their success in the district seems promising, and that in November, will give their side the majority. In the context of the picnic, Hon. Ferdinand Williams and Hon. George Wellington of the Democratic Party iterated similar their thoughts. Alleghany County is all right. The people up there both Republicans and Democrats, have told me so, and I think they know what they are talking about. Richard Walsh and William Fox noted that such conventions were important to get people out to vote. Because once formed a connection with the candidate, felt a sense of obligation to him.

Besides discussing the elections and issues, Col. L.V. Baughran resigned despite the pleas from the membersHowever, he will still work as an active member of the party to ensure the victory of all party candidates, most importantly, Ferdinand Williams. I believe that his resignation was due to workload. During this time period, chairmen take on considerable amount of work, pressure, and responsibility. Aging, without a strong helping hand, stepping down was the only rational choice. However, his subsequent decision to stay an active member in politics is more important. It exemplifies the privilege one gets from social service. Not monetary, or status, but victory of a party in those times meant good times for you. For there concerns and issues that they addressed in government, were reflective of yours. After resignation, many still felt the need to be in politics, for he was able to recognize the service that it offered not only him, but also his community.

Several years earlier a South Carolina citizen by the name of George Ford had been murdered by a slave named Joe (also called Forest) owned by a Mr. Carroll of Richland County. Both Mr. Ford's relatives, as well as the state, offered more than 1,000 dollars for the capture of the runaway slave, but no one was successful in apprehending him. Joe was actually so successful in evading capture that he arose as a leadership figure for other runaway slaves in the area, and established a camp of criminal runaways in the depths of the local swamp."," The local citizens had continued to grow more and more uneasy about the presence of this camp of slaves in their community, fearing the group was planning a large scale insurrection. They had petitioned the state and Commander- in- Chief to call in proper military forces to dispel the rebellious camp. When the state did not respond to their requests they took matters into their own hands and formed a civilian militia, intent on finding and eliminating the threat themselves. The expedition was unsuccessful until a slave named Royal, owned by a citizen of Richland County, guided the militia to Joe's camp, allowing the group of fugitives to be captured and hanged for attempted murder. More than 70 citizens signed the petition asking the assembly to grant full compensation to the slave Royal for his assistance in serving the state and the citizens in the capture. The general assembly rewarded Royal's owner seven hundred dollars compensation to delegate to Royal as she saw appropriate."," The above petition provides a view into the complex racial relations in upstate South Carolina, as well as those typical across the antebellum South. The Richland district was one of largest cotton producing regions of South Carolina during this period, and was therefore one of the districts most reliant upon slave labor, resulting in a majority black population. The reality of a black majority may have resulted in a kind of reign of terror, much like other areas of the South with large slave populations. According to historian Walter Edgar, the period before this petition was issued was dotted with incidences of slave revolts across South Carolina: Columbia in 1805, Camden in 1816, and more rumors of rebellion in the coastal areas in 1822. The uneasiness of the white slave owners is clearly represented in the description of this petition and the citizens' insistence on finding the runaway slave and his camp of followers, as well as their desire to reward faithful slaves. The situation illustrated here shows the typical contrast between the wariness of Southerners with respect to threats to the system of slavery and their absolute reliance on slaves as faithful servants and members of Southern communities."],"display_date":1824,"search_date":"1824-07-01","locations":[{"id":11634,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3060,"title":"The Indian Bills\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-06-12","end_date":"1830-06-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 12, 1830, the editor of the <em>Macon Telegraph</em> finally snapped.  Under massive pressure from their northern brethren on the Indian Bills, the Telegraph vehemently defended the territorial rights of the state of Georgia.  The newspaper viewed the Indian Bills as a simple issue of property rights, not one of Indian removal and southern supremacy.  According to their interpretation, Georgia had adequately paid the monetary demands of the Cherokees to the land that they once possessed and thus had every right to the land, regardless of who currently resided upon it. After explaining that Georgia sufficiently paid for the land and thus legally owned it, the <em>Macon Telegraph</em> turned its attention to the criticism coming from other states.  The <em>Telegraph</em> placed specific blame on the North, who hated to see the growth of the South and the consequent wane of its own preponderance in Congress.  Removing the Indians and ensuring Georgia's sovereignty would also expand its representative power in Congress, and, alternatively, decrease the congressional delegation of the North.  Because of this, the North, they believed, would do anything to slow the economic and physical expansion of the South.  ","Finally, the Telegraph asserted that Georgia did in fact have the concerns of the poor Indians in mind.   While the North had their own motives in mind rather than those of the Indians, Georgia did not wish to injure or harm the natives.  In fact, the editorial continued, Georgia had already paid a large sum for the land and had patiently awaited the exit of the Indians to lands west of the Mississippi.  This payment proved that the Cherokees had left by their own free choice rather than by coercion.  Furthermore, the Indian tribes were destined for healthy, fertile lands abound in game, leaving them infinitely better off than they were or ever could be in Georgia.","The Telegraph's disdain for the North only grew once Chief Justice John Marshall stepped into the controversy.  In Worcester v. Georgia, Chief Justice Marshall sided with Samuel Austin Worcester and Elizur Butler, two missionaries that wished to live with the Cherokees in Georgia territory.  The Indian Removal Acts had declared that these Cherokees must leave Georgia, but Worcester and Butler ignored the law and instead sued the state.  According to Marshall, the two missionaries and their Cherokee friends had every right to remain in Georgia. Marshall declared that the state of Georgia did not have the authority to regulate the intercourse between the citizens of its state and the members of the Cherokee Nation because the Indian territory remained in the hands of the Cherokees, not in the hands of the Georgia government as the <em>Telegraph</em> asserted.  Thus, the interactions between the Cherokee Nation and the American government must occur on the federal level, not the state level.  In this way, Georgia law was not binding to the Cherokee peoples because it interfered with American laws and treaties that were superior to state law.","Famously, Andrew Jackson strongly resisted Marshall's ruling.  Although Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune misquoted Jackson as saying that John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it, the inaccurate quote captured Jackson's attitude towards Marshall and the Cherokees.  Instead of executing the outcome of Worchester, Jackson continued his policy of Indian removal.  Although many of the Cherokees adopted the customs and habits of the white Georgians, Jackson insisted on their removal from the state.  In 1832, Jackson pressed the Cherokees to sign a treaty ceding their lands to the state of Georgia.  This treaty required that the Cherokees depart the state in two years.  This exodus finally began six years later, in 1838.  Through rain and snow, lacking sufficient food, clothing, and shelter, Jackson forced the Cherokees out of Georgia and towards Oklahoma.  The Trail of Tears was lined with thousands of dead Cherokees, forever removed from their Georgia home."],"display_date":"June 12, 1830","search_date":"1830-06-12","locations":[{"id":1547,"lat":32.8060034472,"lng":-83.7076277097,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3061,"title":"A New Reservation for Geronimo\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-07-07","end_date":"1889-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Chief Geronimo and his Apaches were forcibly removed from the western territories of the United States. The government relocated them to Mt. Vernon Barracks, Alabama, where they were forced to stay, cramped and confined, until the government decided what to do with them and where to send them next. As Native Americans, they were at the mercy of an unsympathetic government. ","Sometime thereafter, Captain John Bourke and Professor Painter of the Indian Rights Association located a tract of land in North Carolina of about 10,000 acres. Cherokees owned the land and 2,000 members of the Cherokee tribe lived on it, but they were willing to sell it to the Indian Rights Association. All that stood in the way of Geronimo and his tribe moving to their reservation was the approval of the Secretary of War. As anything would have been better than the living conditions in Alabama, the tribe was willing to move onto the land if the government would never allow it to return to the west. ","The Cherokees of Swain County managed to escape the forced removal of the eastern Indian tribes along the Trail of Tears in 1838, remaining where they were for the rest of the century. Only by avoiding the Trail of Tears were these Cherokees able to be a party to the land transaction that created a reservation for Geronimo?s Apache tribe. The government of the United States gradually recognized the Cherokee tribe in North Carolina in the period after 1870, enabling the transaction described in this episode. The roles the government and the Native American tribes play in this episode illustrate the long history of forced removal, resettlement, and upheaval characteristic of the interactions of the two groups.

In Alabama, a region of mostly cash-poor landowners and farmers, free silver seemed to be central to their future economic survival and prosperity. This episode highlights a trend in political alignment at this time. The Populist party and other men standing for free silver joined together in political alliances with traditional Republicans and Democrats in hopes of gaining more power.

Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

He began by saying that although South Carolina held an advantage over other areas in rich natural resources, these resources had not been taken advantage of to their full extent, and little interaction occurred within the state's different regions. The author of the letter stated his opinion that it was imperative that the state improve the condition of its roads and rivers. Although clearly these projects would be expensive, it would be well worth the high costs to decrease transportation costs and risks to horses, drivers, and health."," The newspaper letter expressed several suggestions for the state and the citizens as to specific internal improvements for South Carolina. The first was to consult with a state engineer and complete several surveys of the roadways for the purpose of improving passageways from Camden to Charleston. The second suggestion was for the improvement of the river systems so it would be possible for a steam boat to navigate the waterways from Camden to Charleston at any time of year without danger. However, the author also warned that the citizens of South Carolina should not expect much in the form of financial aid from the state or federal government. His reasoning behind this was that the district's representatives only made up a small proportion of the community, the legislature only met for three short weeks each year, and similar requests in the past had been ignored. Such required improvements might therefore need to be financed by town corporations, with the hopes that the state legislature would reimburse them at a later point."," Throughout the antebellum period South Carolina was the target of many different policies of internal improvement because of its economic and agricultural value to the union. According to historian John Conger the state was blessed with a natural expanse of waterways, but massive amounts of funding were needed to better organize the water routes for use in transportation and trading. The state never received the necessary federal funding for such projects because the mountains to the west and northwest made improvements difficult and kept South Carolina isolated from trade with her neighboring states, effectively discouraging the federal government from allocating funds to the state. Frustrations from the lack of funding for internal improvements eventually grew into frustrations with national tariffs because the civilians of South Carolina claimed they never received the same benefits from surplus government revenue as other states in the union."],"display_date":"June 6, 1818","search_date":"1818-06-06","locations":[{"id":11550,"lat":34.3452377501,"lng":-80.5785175162,"zoom":9,"place":"KERSHAW, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3107,"title":"Measure to Prohibit the Introduction of Slaves for Sale Into Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-11-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1851, Mr. McDougald introduced a bill to the Georgia legislature that would have banned further importation of slaves for sale into the state. The purpose of the bill was supposedly to ensure the survival of slavery in the state, but it was largely opposed. People disagreed on the real intentions of the bill, and on what the consequences of it would be. The Georgia <em>Telegraph</em> called the policy unwise, impolitic, and short-sighted. It was fraught with as much injury to the institution of slavery as if the policy had been generated in Massachusetts for the express purpose of destroying the institution. ","Both sides of the debate were pro-slavery, but could not agree on how to preserve the institution. Most argued that the bill favored the wealthy by increasing the value of the slaves they already owned, thus maintaining the planter class's status quo by making it extremely difficult for other farmers to procure slave labor at a reasonable price. Supporters of the bill believed that if the interstate slave trade continued, slaves would eventually become so numerous that they would no longer be a profitable labor source. Slaves would become less valuable as their numbers increased. Eventually, the cost of maintaining them would exceed their worth, and the practice of slaveholding would die out entirely. ","An editorial published in the <em>Telegraph</em> argued that the measure would have an exact opposite, negative effect. Prohibiting the slave trade would likely inspire other southern states to do the same, and eventually slave-selling states like Virginia would no longer have a market for their primary export. If Virginia's economy collapsed, the state would abolish slavery, and others would follow. The <em>Telegraph</em> argued, Who does not know that the accumulation of slaves, without reciprocal benefits, without profitable results, would eventuate in its abolition even in Georgia or Mississippi. What man would own slaves, if they only run him in debt The bill initially failed to pass. Amendments were twice offered on the original bill, and the bill succeeded on its third try by a 57-44 vote. Two days later, a motion was made to reconsider the bill, and it was finally rejected on an appeal to its constitutionality."],"display_date":"November - December 1851","search_date":"1851-11-30","locations":[{"id":1525,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3108,"title":"Shall We Unite?

Kean, division still belied his society. In seeking those similarities which connect the North with the South, Kean made a poignant point, asking readers of the People's Party Paper to recall those 23 New York Unknown who similarly left their homes with the kisses of their mother still on their brows. He writes, What happened in New York had its counterpart in Georgia. We take a delight in fixing the graves, be it either '23 New York, Unknown,' or '3 Mississippi, Unknown' for in the beautiful strain of Osian 'It is the memory of joys that are past and gone, sweet and mournful to the soul.' Kean suggested that by putting to rest those divisions between the North and South, the South was better able to welcome the West and usher it into a new era of American history. At one point, he writes Shall we submit longer? The crisis is now at hand; shall we unite with the West? The union is offered; if we choose we can accept. The West and South are both agricultural countries. Let us accept this union and thereby declare that our actions speaking for us declare our intentions are to unite with the West. This country will be happy when it recognizes 'no North, no South, no East, no West, but loves with equal tenderness both sections and trusts. Georgia alike with Kansas.' ","It is difficult to ascertain how unique Kean was in his sentiments. How many other readers of the People's Party Paper sought a unified national identity decades after war ravaged families and communities in both the North and South? Kean mentions the community's commemoration of the 23 New York Unknown. The many battlefields and memorials like this one which dapple the space above and below the Mason Dixon Line testify not only to the devastation of the period and the subsequent need to memorialize the experience, but also to the regional identities which formed as a result of it. Just 27 years earlier, the turmoil of the Civil War ravaged the country, simultaneously confusing national and southern identity. Like Kean, many individuals questioned how the nation would be able to incorporate the West when it was simultaneously struggling to throw off the yoke of war and the fractious identities which had formed as a result of it and Reconstruction.","The loss of over 620,000 lives during the course of the Civil War far exceeded any previous American engagement. Fathers, brothers, lovers, and friends were lost and indelible and scarring experiences assumed their place, ensuring that masses of families and communities on both sides of the divide would live the aftershocks of the Civil War for decades later. The reverberations from this dramatic loss would also echo in social, political, and economic spheres as America strove to develop a cohesive identity amongst its growing pains in the late nineteenth-century. With the 1892 establishment of Ellis Island in New York as the main hub for immigrant processing and the subsequent need to expand, new questions of identity and inclusion were bound to arise. Specifically, the settlement of the West presented yet another challenge to Southern identity and unity. Kean's letter is evidence of at least some Southern support for inclusion and unity, but the well-documented racial and ethnic tension which developed at the same time point towards an equally-passionate opposition."],"display_date":"April 12, 1892","search_date":"1892-04-12","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3147,"title":"The Annexation Debate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-02-10","end_date":"1844-02-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The weather was the same as usual and so was the company. Adolphus Sterne went with his friends Mr. Houghson, Mr. Hoya, and Mr. Linn to Colonel Raguet's house for dinner. After dinner the Colonel accompanied the group to Mr. Moore's for a meeting of the debating society. Sterne presided over the debate and listened to each side equally. The fiery speech of wild Bill Sparks, a former Republic of Texas Congressman, would be difficult to beat. The debate was on the question of whether or not it was beneficial for Texas to be annexed into the United States. Sterne deliberated then gave the victory to the side which argued against annexation. ","Annexation of Texas into the United States was a big debate, and as early as September 1836, the majority Texans had given their support to annexation into the United States; however, as late as 1844, there were still some who thought that Texas would fare better if it remained an independent republic. One of the major concerns of opponents to annexation was war with Mexico. Since Mexican officials never recognized Texas independence as legitimate, and they disagreed on the official boundaries of Texas, annexation into the United States would certainly cause conflict. A war with Mexico would be tragic for Texas as it would be fought on their own land. Having just finished their own war with Mexico, it is understandable that some Texans would want to avoid further bloodshed. ","Pro-British sentiments also played a role in some Texans' opposition to annexation. Britain had recognized the independence of Texas and played an integral role in peace negotiations between Texas and Mexico in 1843. Some even thought that Britain could force Mexico to recognize Texas's Independence. Britain adamantly opposed annexation and was willing to do what it could to prevent annexation. The British feared the results of annexation: expansion of the United States, loss of profitable trade with Texas, and the extension of slavery. Britain was one of Texas's key allies and upsetting its people could be detrimental to Texas. Trade with the British was profitable for Texans too, and loss of that trade would hurt the struggling economy. ","The annexation of Texas was a hot issue in the 1840s because of its far-reaching consequences for several countries. Just like in the United States, there were in Texas both those who supported and those who opposed annexation. Texans who opposed annexation thought that Texas had more to gain by remaining an independent republic. Sparks was of this opinion and must have had valid reasons to support it, seeing as he won the debate for his side."],"display_date":"February 10, 1844","search_date":"1844-02-10","locations":[{"id":15203,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3166,"title":"Texas Secedes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-02-02","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["War fever and the eagerness to fight ran rampant as soon as Texas officially seceded from the Union. William Williston Heartsill, a young 22 year old store clerk working in Marshall, Texas was one of the first to enlist. Before he had left for training, Heartsill began a diary to record all the moments and sentiments leading to the cause of his enlistment. He believed that it was imperative to fight and to the fight the best we can. Heartsill was a passionate man who did not think the war would last longer than 12 months, as their cause is just before high Heaven, that we will succeed in this great undertaking. Heartsill supported and followed actively the road to secession, acknowledging the election of Abraham Lincoln as the event that set the wheels in motion for the mass-meetings that convened in every county in the state to lead to the nearly unanimous vote for secession. "," After Lincoln was elected President, many Texans felt threatened regarding the future of slavery. Although slavery came comparatively late to Texas, by Lincoln's election one of every four Texas families owned slaves. The citizens quickly urged Governor Sam Houston to call a convention for Texas to decide the course of their future. As a man dedicated to the Union, Houston repeatedly forestalled the convention fearing the future results. However, the convention was finally legally organized by state legislature on January 28, 1861. The Texas Ordinance of Secession was drafted and voted upon with a favorable margin of 166 to 8 on February 1, 1861. Houston refused to accept the convention, sign the document, or take the oath of allegiance to the new government, thereby resigning as Governor. "," The Texas Ordinance declared that Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated States to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquillity and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. The decision to secede was fueled by several grievances including the sending of pamphlets and papers to stir insurrection throughout Texas, distribution of arms to slaves and the hindering the slave institution, and refusing to allow appropriations for protection against Indians.

Most of the people who expired were victims of the same mysterious affliction: high fever, muscle aches, vomiting and an eventual yellowish tint to the skin that preceded death. Baffled physicians prescribed everything from doses of quinine to sponge-baths to calomel, with no telling what the results would be from patient to patient. After a hiatus period, the summer of 1853 was particularly bad for the city, with thousands upon thousands succumbing to this sickness. One Dr. J. S. M'Farlane expressed regret that the city had become complacent and fallen under the impression that the hygienic condition of our city would be meliorated to such an unparalleled degree, that yellow fever and cholera were to fly shrieking to India and Rio Janeiro... Things were so bad that the city published a pamphlet entitled The Epidemic Summer: List of Interments in all the Cemeteries of New Orleans, which, because of the staggering death toll, was in actuality the size of a slender book."," By 1853, a multitude of opinions regarding the fever existed in the medical field. Dr. M'Farlane composed the pamphlet's opening remarks, and made summarizing statements that included his thoughts: he did not believe that yellow fever was contagious, nor that quarantine regulations would effectively prevent the disease. His printed words expressed a rising conviction that yellow fever would have to be combated differently than the typical epidemic disease. Dr. M'Farlane's careful word choice, most noticeable in his presentation of these statements as opinions, still points towards a hesitation to categorize anything about this disease as absolute truth.; however, the fact that this was a city publication indicates that reasoning like his was beginning to gain some credibility. If the city was willing to support his claims by publishing them, those same claims must have been achieving more and more popularity."," As it still stood, popular opinion claimed that, since the freshest faces in New Orleans were most susceptible to yellow fever, it could also be referred to as the Stranger's Disease. The Epidemic Summer itself perpetuates this belief: of the 67 pages of small print filled with names of the dead, a significant number of them are shown to be immigrants; most often from Ireland or Germany. This common belief perpetuated stereotypes against these newcomers. Although in reality the city suffered from bouts of yellow fever because of its high volume of traffic with mosquito-ridden Latin America, the stratification of its victims played into the existing prejudices towards ethnicities and classes."],"display_date":"May 1, 1853 - November 1, 1853","search_date":"1853-08-01","locations":[{"id":5598,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3175,"title":"Frederick County Meeting\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-14","end_date":"1860-12-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 14, 1860, just six days before South Carolina seceded from the United States of America, men in Frederick County, Virginia met to discuss the possible results of secession and how to go about preventing it. Mr. Conrad delivered a speech on the subject to the meeting in which he discussed the ills inflicted on the southern states by the North such as disregard for run away slave laws and their disregard for the importance of slavery in the South in general. He stated that We assure our northern brethren that the institution against which this insane war is waged, is so interwoven into our social, domestic, and industrial life, that any sudden change would be destructive to us, and even to themselves. While Mr. Conrad made it clear that the citizens of Frederick Country would not tolerate actions against slavery, he also states that secession will only worsen the situation. Mr. Conrad pleads for reconsideration by South Carolina in this statement: Hence; we do not question the power of South Carolina, in virtue of her state sovereignty to absolve her citizens from their allegiance to the federal government. But we do utterly deny her right, under the circumstances that now exist; and as parties to the compact, deeply interested in its fulfillment, we deny that she alone has the right to decide whether adequate cause exists. Mr. Conrad also presented several solutions to the conflict with the North which he suggests giving to the Virginia General Assembly. We may obstruct the wheels of the Federal Government; or defend our Constitutional rights, in arms, under the flag of the Union; and even these extreme measures would be less fatal than a voluntary secession, he stated. He and the members of the meeting agreed that South Carolina did secede the North would be quick to put them back into place and repair their own actions against slavery. The remedy is with our Northern friends: we await their action with trust and confidence that they will now see and appreciate the evil, and apply the proper correctives. "," After the secession of South Carolina the rest of the southern states were left with a very critical decision: stay in the union and allow the north to force its anti-slavery ideals upon the entire south or join the rebellion, unsure of what would come next. The question facing the upper South was not simply whether to secede but whether to aid their brothers farther south. This looming decision divided the South into three sections. The first was made up of those southerners mostly in the lower South who believed in immediate secession, the idea being the quicker secession is accomplished by the south the stronger the statement. The next group was made up of southerners in the upper South with fewer slaves who wished to wait until a group effort by all the states was decided on before seceding. The last group was made up of those who sided with the North and were against secession completely, this seeming to be the group that Mr. Conrad would side with as he confirmed by stating: We have no faith whatever in the success of any southern confederacy of these States, except merely for the temporary object of mutual defense. South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, being of the immediate secession group, all joined the rebellion with majority votes in their conventions soon after the election of President Abraham Lincoln. About the election of President Lincoln Mr. Conrad stated The election of Mr. Lincoln is recent, was unexpected, fortuitous, and if not already regretted by his supporters, will, in all probability, prove the destruction of his party. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina also joined the cause with a majority but only after President Lincoln called for a move on South Carolina, being more of the second group. In Virginia the decision on secession was especially important because Virginians were so close to the North and the South at the same time. As Edward Ayers confirmed, More than half of the war's battles were waged with in Virginia's borders, making their decision especially critical. While Virginia did decide to ultimately secede the vote was deeply divided. The slaveholders, mainly living in the east, wanted to secede while the non slave holders in the west wanted to remain in the union.

There were many factors that led fathers, brothers, and sons, to become soldiers, and just as many reasons to evade the conscription laws.

In 1862, the Confederate State Congress passed a conscription law that called all men in the ages between 15 and 45 into service. Many men did voluntarily fight, and others followed the conscription law so that at one time there were more Texans fighting in the army than votes cast in any of the states elections. Although many Texans did fight in the war, the conscription policy proved detrimental to morale since many were forced to fight and others viewed the law as unconstitutional.

In fact, conscription tended to force the older men who were settled and needed to stay ar home into finding a substitute. While many outwardly voiced disapproval to those who did not go and fight, newspapers were more frequently filled with bids ranging upwards of thousands of dollars to take another's place.

Southern citizens and soldiers saw military men such as Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee to be divinely inspired leaders in whom they could trust and depend upon. With each Confederate victory on the battlefield God's preference was confirmed.

The poor were restricted from fishing and hunting, homestead exemption laws that allowed those in debt to keep their homes were repealed, and poll taxes ensured these poor could not affect political policy. In fact, the region of Appalachia was in worse shape after Reconstruction than after the Civil War. With these facts, the bias of the Courier Journal and the intentions of candidates selected in Wheeling become ever more intriguing."],"display_date":"January 22, 1877 - December 31, 1877","search_date":"1877-07-12","locations":[{"id":14751,"lat":40.0969277883,"lng":-80.6189090562,"zoom":11,"place":"OHIO, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3206,"title":"Property of a Newspaper Owner\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-10-15","end_date":"1856-10-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Joseph Addison Waddell was a wealthy and influential man in nineteenth-century Augusta County, Virginia. He owned the Staunton <em>Spectator</em> from 1856-1860. The <em>Spectator </em>reached many residents of Augusta County. He kept an extensive diary during his life, of which the years 1855-1865 are still preserved. On October 15, 1856, after having contemplated the hopeless Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and having acknowledged the local impact of national politics, Waddell thought of the assessment of his father's property, earlier that day and gave an estimate of his own possessions. Among those, he noted his printing office, stocks, bonds, two of his slaves, furniture, silverware, and a slew of other commodities, totaling to an understated 8700. His slaves Selena and Moses were mentioned in the middle of Waddell's list of property, but later on in the diary entry, Waddell alluded to a moment earlier in the day when a Dr. McGill offered 1000 for Selena. Waddell wrote that he would not have sold Selena for 20,000, unless she desired to go, or had grossly misbehaved. He continued to espouse his philosophy that, Speculating on human flesh is utterly horrible to me and he explained that he wished slavery were extinct, yet claimed to be no abolitionist and advocated that he lived in a time when emancipation was not prudent."," There was a socially accepted hypocrisy for the slaveholding Southerners. Slaveholders, like Waddell, separated the morality of slavery and the slave market. The slave market was a disgusting profit-driven business, owned by those merchants of disease and disorder slave traders. Historian Walter Johnson illuminates the contradiction that slaveholders could sell slaves as well, but believed that it was not with the intent of making a profit; there was always a noncommercial reason for selling a slave. This invisible line provided enough self-justification for slaveholders to shift the guilt of human exploitation onto those slave traders. Slaveholders were able to control and decide the actions of their slaves because they were property. The hypocrisy lies in the question, if slave traders only sold sub-human property, then why the disgust with slave traders? And if slave traders were trading people, not just property, than how could slaveholders justify owning people? This self-justifying hypocrisy lies at the heart of slave-ownership."],"display_date":"October 15, 1856 - October 16, 1856","search_date":"1856-10-15","locations":[{"id":13638,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3207,"title":"Collision of the Georgia Legislature and Courts\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-01-13","end_date":"1815-11-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 13, 1815, the Superior Court of the state of Georgia convened in Augusta and ruled numerous acts passed by the Georgia legislature unconstitutional and void.  The legislature furiously answered on November 19, 1815, with a condemning resolution absolutely denying the right of the courts to rule the acts of the state legislature invalid.  The resolution did not specifically mention which acts the Superior Court ruled unconstitutional simply because the Georgia House had no concern for the specific policy ramifications of the actions of the Court.  Instead, the House sought to absolutely deny the right of the Court to rule any act that the Legislature passed unconstitutional, regardless of the contents of the laws in question.","According to the Legislature, the Court had begun usurping their power the moment that it assembled without direction of the Legislature.  During this session, the Court ruled against a wide array of local judges and legislative acts.  The Georgia House of Representatives declared in its resolution that each of these rulings were void because the Superior Court did not have the standing to try any of the cases. ","The resolution continued, declaring that the actions of the judiciary even usurped the power of the citizens of Georgia.  They claimed that only the legislature has the ability to represent the people because it is the only branch directly elected by the people.  In contrast, the unelected judicial branch simply represented a potentially totalitarian body that could not be controlled through the democratic process.  Because of their institutional inability to check the judicial branch, the Georgia House of Representatives had no choice but to condemn the Court publicly.","With a vote of 40 to 35, the Georgia House of Representatives rejected the Superior Court's power to rule on the constitutionality of the actions of the Legislature and declared that the Georgia Superior Court should never again wrest the power of the good citizens of this state through such rulings.  Finally, and most condemningly, the Georgia House recommended a candid examination of the United States Constitution as well as the Georgia Constitution for a better understanding of the court's position in relation to the legislative branch of government.  At the time, no precedent existed regarding whether the state judiciary should simply focus solely on its own state constitution or on the Constitution of the United States as well.  The Georgia House of Representatives concluded that the Georgia Superior Court should re-evaluate both.","The ongoing struggle for power between the judicial, legislative, and executive branches winds its way in and out of American history.  Few powers in the United States Constitution are as vague as that of judicial review, or the power of the judiciary to review the acts of the legislature and executive and rule on their constitutionality.  Even the Founders were split.  While James Madison, the author of the Constitution, favored judicial review, Thomas Jefferson feared it.  ","Georgia's Superior Court, however, did not act entirely out of historical context.  Other state courts had declared their power of judicial review in the twenty eight years of governance under the United States Constitution.  <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, which was ruled 12 years before this specific controversy in Georgia, declared that the United States Supreme Court had the power of judicial review over the federal government.  On the state level, the Georgia Constitution's language in Article III, Section One seems to mirror that of the federal constitution, and, according to Chief Justice John Marshall, this type of constitutional language allows for the courts to rule acts of the other two branches of government unconstitutional.  However, Chief Justice Marshall's ruling in <em>Marbury</em> did not put the controversy of judicial review to rest.  Many lawyers at the state and federal level did not believe that Marbury settled the judicial review controversy once and for all. ","In this way, the debate between the Georgia House of Representatives and the Georgia Superior Court fits perfectly into the national debate on judicial review.  The Georgia Superior Court exerted its power to declare the acts of the Georgia legislature null and void.  Like other legislatures across the nation, the Georgia House of Representatives vengefully denied the court's usurpation of power in this condemning resolution."],"display_date":"January 13, 1815 - November 19, 1815","search_date":"1815-06-17","locations":[{"id":1521,"lat":33.0753708914,"lng":-83.2660648937,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3210,"title":"The State Seal: A Symbol of Revolution\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-30","end_date":"1861-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The bird of liberty sat perched on top of a Magnolia, waiting to strike a cautiously approaching serpent that threatened the safety of her nest.

Just as the nation had fought off a tyrannically government in 1776, they too were freeing themselves from the chains of tyranny that they believed the United States government now held them in.

"," On March 28, 1861, John Pettus called this dire situation to the attention of the Mississippi State Convention and suggested numerous ways in which the plight could be eliminated. Pettus asked that the Convention do everything possible to extend to the destitute the aid required, and invoked the full power of the State to apply the remedy. Pettus suggested that the counties that were destitute of food crops should be allowed to use all county funds, school funds, and the like for the purchase of corn.

In fact, they raided and looted all across Texas in response to the constant threat of losing even more territory. While Indians succeeded by burning stations and driving settlers from their homes, their actions spurred many more debates, conventions, and other attempts to deal with the Indians. One attempt to coexist with the Indians was through the creation of reservations. Some Indians were able to acclimate, while others with a more nomadic lifestyle found it quite difficult. Tensions continued between the Indians and settlers as more settlers encroached on the reservation land and Indians continued to raid and roam throughout Texas and Mexico. In fact, the dangerous raids and attacks performed by the Indians forced several local volunteer units and the United States army to become involved. A convention was later assembled that structured and firmly established the United States and Texas's view of the Indian nuisance. The resolutions of Dr. R. G. Worrall of Jacksboro, adopted in Galveston in April, 1860, articulated the general public sentiment by stating All Indians were hostile and should be exterminated or expelled from the State and that the frontier must not be contracted.

Mobley represented the ideals of the People's Party, which promoted government control to boost the agricultural economy. Mobley's main focus centered on how both of the national parties, democrats or republicans, could not be counted on to aid farmers. Russell argued for the tariff and exemplified the ideals of the Democratic Party. Due to the strong support of the Populist ideals held by the citizens who attended the rally, Russell left the debate a loser.","After the Panic of 1873 the agricultural market in America crashed.

The farmers of the Populist Party took different economic actions to aid them in their fight for stronger agriculture in America. The farmers wanted to use the government as a vehicle for readjusting what they felt were increasingly pronounced imbalances of political and economic life in America. They also wanted government ownership of railroads and telegraphs. Many residents of states in the western United States and the South became involved in the Populist Party because these regions relied largely on a strong agricultural economy.","The Populist Party encouraged people to attend their meetings which discussed issues pertaining to the ideals of the party.

The colored silk line in the genuine are not in the counterfeit. ","The business of counterfeit money was quite a large one throughout the mid nineteenth century according to Johnson. By the time the Civil War had begun 80 percent of the money in circulation in the United States was counterfeit. Because there were so many versions of counterfeit dollars and coins shop keepers and business owners had no choice but to accept the false money because they were not likely to find much real money. During his tenure from 1869 to 1874 as Chief of the Secret Service, Hiram C. Whitley reported (10 percent sample) that 32 people had been caught in the business of counterfeit money in the South in comparison to the 100 in the Mid-Atlantic and seven in New England. After reconstruction the South was left with unused mints that they had relied on during the civil war for the creation of their monetary system. These mints and other newly created ones helped in the increase of counterfeit money throughout the South. Counterfeiting notes, as the article talked about, was much harder than producing coins. It required a large sum of money, dedicated employees and a large group of consumers. Producing coinage was much easier, only requiring an alloy to be poured into a mold and plated.

The newspaper ran articles through out its existence reporting the creation of new counterfeits. They knew that while the money would still passed through private hands, the banks would be less likely to fall for the trick, causing the readers to lose their money.

The guards allowed the inmates razors and stood outside the cells as the prisoners shaved. According to the article, Hawkins turned to the guard, said, Good-bye, and promptly slit his throat. Being near at hand, we ran to see him. He presented a shocking aspect. The blood was spouting rapidly from the horrid gash in his neck, and the bed on which he lay near his head and neck was all saturated with the purple current. A doctor soon arrived and determined that Hawkins had missed the primary artery and would survive.","The same edition of this paper describes Hawkins' escape from his jail in Harrisonburg, Virginia. For much of the time before his recapture, Hawkins was five miles from the jail. He then went to his family in Dayton, where he hid beneath the bed and passed his time knitting socks, which his wife subsequently sold to neighbors. After some time he gathered his family, stole what was believed to be three or four horses, and set out for the west. Authorities recaptured him on the road and sent him back to jail, where he subsequently attempted suicide. ","Hawkins' public escape and recapture brought the prison system into the public eye. One cannot be sure if it was the condition of the prison that provoked him to attempt suicide, or whether he was just a desperate. However, life was difficult for a convict in a penitentiary in Virginia. Labor occupied most of a prisoner's time. Much more so than today, states used penitentiaries to make a profit. In fact, some men bought or leased prisons and then worked their prisoners to death (The lessees worked them quite literally to death in many cases; the mortality rate ranged from 17-40 percent). Leasing became popular in the South, after the war especially, when states could not afford to keep up the prisons. ","As Edward Ayers states in <em>Vengeance and Justice: Crime and Punishment in the 19th-Century American South</em>, the system of slavery in the ante-bellum South kept much of the lower class under control. Because of southern ideals of honor, it seems that there would be less of a need of a prison system; nonetheless, the South built as many prisons as the North (with the exception of Florida and the Carolinas). The South spent much of the time preceding the war to debate whether or not the penitentiary was in fact in line with the American ideals of liberty. Ironically, unlike the North, their lowest class was already imprisoned within society.",">In 1796, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where the penitentiary started, were the only states that attempted to reduce deaths by capital punishment. At that time, the only offense that warranted it was murder. Punishment varied in every region in the country: the penitentiary system in the West was very different. On November 14th, 1856, James R. Whitehead wrote a letter from the Kansas Territory to his cousin Langhan Scruggs, who lived in the Valley of Virginia. In an earlier letter (September 11th), he had described to great detail the sort of men that were settled in the West; northern and southern relations were mirrored in Kansas. The young men were belligerent and chivalrous, always ready to fight. In Whitehead's mind, the West needed new kinds of settlers. In the letter on November 14th, Whitehead wrote about crime and punishment in the territory. More than three hundred Bills of Indictment had been filed, twenty of which were manslaughter. The punishment was far from death; the men found guilty served five years of confinement and hard labor."],"display_date":"February 29, 1848","search_date":"1848-02-29","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3289,"title":"WANTED \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-31","end_date":"1875-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A wanted ad for a man named Jeff Williams appeared in The Daily Mississippi Pilot?s reward section. Williams was a convict who escaped while under lease to a family and working on the Noxubee river levee. The Governor of Mississippi offered 50 dollars for someone to arrest and take Williams to the state penitentiary. The description of the man at large was listed. Along with including his height and age, the paper made a special note that Williams was a mulatto with black hair and was pitted by smallpox. "," Most wanted ads during this time were for missing black convicts. The idea of leasing out convicts came about in the South in the years following the Civil War. Leasing convicts meant that black convicts would have to work the land of a public area or be bound to a white plantation owner who, in exchange for the labor, would pay for the convict?s fines. This idea of leasing convicts became more widespread after the war and gave ex-slave owners a new form of cheap labor to make up for the labor force they lost after the emancipation. Convict leasing also provided the states with a readily available supply of laborers to help build up the railways along with other domestic necessities. "," The high number of black convicts was largely the result of the unfair court systems in the South. Most officers, judges, and even the jurors were predominately white and showed little mercy to black offenders. Yet, most blacks tried to turn to other options to avoid dealing with the court systems of the South. The Freedman?s Bureau was a popular alternative to the unjust systems because in normal trials, blacks did not receive a fair trial. The Freedman?s Bureau was called upon by black defendants to attempt to give them a hearing to try to settle their various disputes with other blacks and, in some cases, disputes with whites. "," In addition to unfair trials, southern laws concerning blacks were also extremely harsh, making it easier to get blacks in prisons to be leased out. Arson became a capital offense, stealing from someone?s home caused the offender to go to prison for life, and the theft of livestock became grand larceny.

He harped on the morals of society and the need for government to back them up. Virtue is the only safeguard of free laws.  He tied into these moral ideas the conflict of slavery with the ideals the nation holds so high.","From a country so situated, bearing all the characteristics of freedom, uncontaminated by vice; with a country degraded and enslaved, abounding with all the evils which hereditary turpitude could engender, from such a contrast, our ancestors derived those impressions, which encouraged their hopes, gave stability to their principles, and produced a nation of freemen eclipsing the model of Greece and Rome.","This is  significant because it makes a statement against slavery in a city where the institution of slavery is such a large part of the economy and every day life. Elfe proceeded to emphasize how important it is that the course of events (the Revolution) happened as they did. He claimed the British owde us reputations for the injustices done Americans. He lauded the Americans in the Revolutionary war and its heroes. He also poses a daunting question: what would have happened had the United States not won the war? His answer is that America would have become like India, the prey of merciless commerce. After praising the United States, reflecting on its values, and championing the Revolutionaries, Elfe ended with praise to the heavens for Americans' escape from tyranny.","It is rare that we find such an argument in 1821.

Davis spoke of the differences between Maine and Mississippi and explained that these differences between the all of the states are what made the United States unique. He expressed how each state had something different to offer the Nation, which made their unity as a country more crucial. Only three years after this eloquent speech in Maine, Jefferson Davis ironically found himself seated in Richmond, Virginia as the President of the Confederate States of America. Davis' speech in 1858 gives evidence to the fact that he and his fellow Mississippians had no clue a major war that would divide the nation was in the making. In 1858, Mississippi and the rest of the South considered themselves part of the great United States. These citizens prided themselves in their state's attributes and differences and worked to use them for the advancement of the nation as a whole.

Looking at Virginia's entire 2 district (heavily African American), which included these Tidewater counties, Democrats appeared to have netted about 4,000 votes, greatly slimming the opposition's lead. Sensing the reaction of Mahone's Readjuster Party, which commanded the Virginian Republican vote, the Democrats planned appropriately. Contacting a renowned gunsmith in Portsmouth, they ordered fifty new Winchester rifles, to be strategically dispersed near important voting precincts. Along with the men unafraid to use these guns, this stern measure of intimidation hoped to discourage white Mahonite leaders from inciting the newly disenfranchised black voters to attack the polling places. Celebrating such an important political gain, Southampton Democrats held a large rally at Newsome's farm attended by great numbers of local farmers. "," Virginia's Reconstruction Constitution in 1869 gave blacks and previously disenfranchised poor whites the right to vote, thus largely expanding the electorate in what had been the South's largest slave holding state. Virginia politics during Reconstruction differed from that of most other former-Confederate states, as no real Republican party emerged. Rather, the Readjuster party took up many Republican platforms, and quickly became the party of the African American vote. The Readjusters combined the black vote with that of the poor whites, and it appeared as if a coalition, capable of challenging the white ruling elite, had finally arisen. Sensing disaster, the Democrats began to couch their political appeals in the late 1880's in strictly racial terms, hoping to appeal to a sense of white solidarity. As they defended themselves from the Readjuster onslaught, Democrats also sought to disenfranchise blacks, thereby stifling a future biracial coalition. "," Unfortunately for the Democrats, the Fifteenth Amendment made it very difficult to restrict the right to vote for race-based reasons at face value. Thus, in this period of Redemption, election officials (most often Democrats themselves) would employ registration and election restrictions that they knew targeted blacks and, subsequently, some poor whites. Oftentimes, they would also commit outright voter fraud by stealing ballots, stuffing ballot boxes, or erasing names from the registration. Virginia also adopted the Australian ballot, aimed at confusing those who could not read, by not listing party names next to candidates, and giving voters less than two minutes in the voting booth. Nonetheless, black leaders, especially in the Tidewater area, continued to resist such coercive measures by flooding the polls with blacks, even if their votes were not being counted. "," Motivated, predominately, by the desire to more effectively hinder the black vote, Virginia, and other Southern states, underwent constitutional conventions in the 1890's. Resulting in residency requirements, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, the South crippled the non-Democratic vote, evidenced by the drastic decline in voter turnout. Whereas 75 percent of eligible voters voted in 1890, this figure dived to 33 percent by 1900. Outright intimidation, though rare, also would emerge in the form of the Klu Klux Klan and the Red Shirts, vigilante groups who ensured few blacks would slip through the cracks. In Virginia's eastern counties, resistance to such Democratic injustice could also spell doom at the hands of newly purchased Winchester rifles.

The general assembly failed to pass a law that would prohibit anyone under the age of 13 from working in cotton factories. The Savannah Press was disturbed by the actions taken by the legislators in Georgia. The general assembly's actions showed that the need for production outweighed the importance of fair labor standards. ","During the nineteenth century many farmers planed cotton throughout the South. In Georgia, cotton was one of the main cash crops. Before the Civil War slaves worked on cotton plantations which attempted to meet the great national and international consumer need for the product. After the Civil War, freedom was declared for African Americans and many plantation owners lost much of their labor force. The owners of plantations needed people to work the land in order to make sure the need for cotton was met. At the time of the industrialization of America the cotton industry grew, and cotton factories were built throughout the South. Cotton manufacturers needed workers in these factories, and the age of the worker did not seem to matter. Manufacturers were willing to employ anyone and the age or the person did not matter. It seemed to the Savannah Press that the necessity for cotton outweighed moral values of the employers who ran the cotton factories. Employers tended to depend on women and children who were under the age of 16 as the main source of the labor force. One textile executive stated that many employers took no regard as to who should work and how many hours a person should work. The legislators in Georgia seemed to agree with the cotton factory employers on the idea that having as many workers as possible in order to meet the demand for cotton was of the utmost importance.

On Thursday last, another person was taken up on suspicion of being engaged in passing counterfeit Bank Notes.

Counterfeiting was one of them. ","The local exchange farmers were issued from their banks was not a national currency which made it very difficult to use when traveling from county to county. In theory, this system was designed so that these notes could be redeemed in gold or silver but people rarely followed through with this method of accounting, making money especially difficult to track and be accounted for. Banks were also put in difficult situations when more notes were being circulated than actual treasure in the bank, threatening these establishments with bankruptcy if everyone tried to cash out at the same time. Trading notes for gold and silver turned into a large problem and banks were forced to figure out ways to avoid giving money back to people who really did not deserve it. In 1819 the price of cotton and other agricultural products fell which worried the people who had traded their gold or silver in for bank notes and believed that the paper money they received would no longer hold any worth at the bank which caused a desperate dash to liquidate their accounts. Opportunities like these were taken advantage of and when thieves got the chance they simply created their own notes so they could walk into a bank and redeem what did not belong to them.","As more banks opened up and more money was invested in them, counterfeiting bills became a problem that needed significant attention. It was suggested by the author of a newspaper article that it is not improbable, that more of this gang infest our country- citizens ought therefore, to be watchful of this kind of fraud. Eventually in Clarksville, the notes of fourteen different independent banks were not taken in the area due to the amount of fraud that had taken place. As the public found out through similar newspaper articles that thieves were stealing money with fake notes, people who had traded in for legitimate money became very worried and skeptical of the system, forcing banks to consider new methods of creating a sound currency.","Counterfeiting remained a serious issue until a national currency was created. It was difficult for the state to keep account of all the notes that were created and all of the money that was stored in banks which made counterfeiting a very easy practice.

While the Democrats had already taken over the Georgia state legislature as early as 1870, the party wished to appease any fears that black citizens may have about the end of Republican rule.  On November 12, 1884, the <em>Savannah News </em>contained an article titled A Word to the Colored People, written by an unnamed Democratic party member.  The author ensured black citizens that they need have no fears that there will be any attempt by the Democratic party to abridge any of the rights and privileges which they gained after the Civil War.

In it, a gentleman from Natchitoches, Louisiana reported that the Chief of the Caddo Indian Confederacy was plotting a conspiracy with the Spanish officials in Texas. Despite having traveled into the province on mercantile business, the Chief returned spouting adoration for King Ferdinand VII and boasting of his new title: Generalisimo of all the Indian tribes resident beyond the celebrated Arrayo Honde, between [Natchitoches] and the Sabine. All travelers in this area were subject to arrest by this new minister of the Spanish monarch. The citizens of Natchitoches feared the consequences. Their town was located only a short six miles from Arrayo Honde. The author of the letter feared increased violence and Indian attacks against townspeople and adventurous Americans, as well as the encumbrance of Spanish authority in what he believed to be American lands.","Until 1819, the Spanish still laid claims to the lands of Louisiana just east of the Sabine River up to the Arrayo Honde, a tributary of the Red River, while Americans held that the Sabine maintained the border between Spanish Texas and American Louisiana. During Thomas Jefferson's presidency, the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon, who approved the sale to promote war against Britain. The territory of Louisiana had only just changed from Spanish to French hands through the treaty of San Ildefonso three years earlier. Neither the French nor the Americans attempted to define the borders of the territory until the treaty was signed in 1803, at which point, the French foreign minister replied, I can give you no direction. You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it. ","For the next two decades, the Spanish in Texas and the Americans migrating into Louisiana wrestled over land. The treaty did not define the western border of the Louisiana Territory, so the Spanish sought means to push their claim and authority further east, through individuals like the Caddo Chief, while American settlers pushed back with equal force. The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 solved these struggles. It gave up American claims to Texas and Spanish claims east of the Sabine. Despite opposition from westerners who steamed over the loss of Texas, support for the treaty was unanimous in Congress.","This episode demonstrated a significant disjunction between the federal government's concerns and the desires of the American people actually living on the frontier in Louisiana. The author stated somewhat sardonically, How far this affair may require the interpolation of government, government will best determine; but be assured we consider it a matter of considerable importance. The author's tone and comments dripped with disdain for a government that seemed unconnected with his needs. The sense that the people actually living in these borderlands might need to defend their own rights because their government was unable or unwilling to do so permeated throughout the letter.

The Bill argued that the Southwestern part of Virginia needed access to major trade routes. The majority was in opposition to the original bill (for many reasons, particularly monetary), so Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge County, Virginia proposed a substitute bill, which was found more agreeable by the legislature than the original. The preamble was as follows: Whereas it is important to the interests of the Southwestern part of Virginia, and of the State and public generally, that the vast resources of that section of Virginia shall have free and unrestricted outlet, but the shortest and most direct route, to any market whatsoever.","After heated debate, the Virginia Legislature eventually rejected the bill. The city of Lynchburg took it upon themselves. They began work on the Lynchburg-Tennessee railroad in 1850. It ran 204 miles from Lynchburg, past present-day Roanoke (then called Big Lick), and down to Bristol, Tennessee.","From 1850-1860 in the South, the growth of railroads was immense. In Alabama the mileage went from 100 to 610 in ten years. This was impressive considering the effect the Panic of 1837 had by stopping railroad growth. In a time when the North was painting the South as backwards and devoted to an agrarian ideal society, the South was spending millions of dollars to build railroads and industrialize their economy. They knew that it would be necessary if they wanted to remain a part of international business, and they needed efficient transportation for all the resources they were supplying. Industrially speaking, it was still far behind the North; only 10 percent of the manufactured goods in the United States came from the eleven states that seceded from the Union."],"display_date":"January 29, 1849","search_date":"1849-01-29","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3394,"title":"Democrat Disappointments\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-03-25","end_date":"1885-03-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Civil Service be (blanked), said he, do you suppose the (blanked) (blanked) old fool thought we were in earnest about such (blanked) (blanked) nonsense and not as that? A Democratic workingman had no trouble speaking his mind to a Norfolk gentleman, out on the streets, when asked of his opinion of President Cleveland. The workingman, having so ardently supported the first Democratic president-elect since Reconstruction, expressed a widespread Southern feeling of discontent towards the man whose election had so recently stirred uncontrollable celebrations throughout the South. As a loyal rank and file Democrat, this man expected to be rewarded for his vote. Instead, he found himself turned away from what, in his own mind, should have been party jobs. Regarding Cleveland's lack of patronage he replied, Whoever heard of an Army [that] after cleaning out and capturing the entire camp, turns over all the spoils of war and commissary stores to the enemy? Why it is the d---dest foolishness in the world Democrats, either turned away from patronage jobs across the city or left to compete for single jobs with hundreds of others, felt betrayed by the administration. With mouths to feed at home, the workingman knew he could only remain passive for so long, as his options ran low."," Before and during the Gilded Age, a politician's duty included getting jobs for his supporters, especially in the South, where political patronage formed a large part of party cohesion. In the 1880's, the Civil Service system, technically, underwent reforms like the Pendleton Act, hoping to replace the spoils system with a more permanent government bureaucracy based on merit. Nonetheless, in practice, government positions at all levels still went to those who had been loyal to the party. Thus, when Cleveland won the election in 1884, the South thought it had great reason to rejoice. Finally, Reconstruction, at the hands of meddling Republican presidents, would be ended and the Democratic South could look to the spoils of their great victory. "," Cleveland had campaigned as a Bourbon Democrat, or one who encouraged economic growth and also sought to remedy corruption in government, namely Civil Service Reform. Southern Democrats, too busy celebrating, did not anticipate Cleveland to stand by that platform, much like other politicians who ran on such appeals. He left many Republicans in their government jobs, meaning that in Virginia, Readjusters still filled spots that the average Democrats believed were rightly theirs. Southern political figures, especially from Virginia complained to Cleveland and asked him to reward their support, becoming insulted when he refused. Terribly disillusioned, Democrats in Virginia would not forget Cleveland's neglect, and when the national Democratic Party re-nominated him in 1892, Virginian Democratic voters place their support elsewhere. Their statement would ring hollow, as Cleveland regained the presidency. Nevertheless, this encounter with the workingman clearly illustrates the expectations of rank and file voters towards their parties, which operated very much as machines churning out benefits to retain loyalty."],"display_date":"March 25, 1885","search_date":"1885-03-25","locations":[{"id":14411,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3399,"title":"Opposition to Special Field Order No. 15\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-01","end_date":"1865-02-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John C. Robinson never owned any slaves. He was born in Binghamton, New York and served as a Union general during the Civil War. Despite his Northern background, Robinson objected to the passage of Special Field Order No. 15, which granted massive amounts of land to former slaves in January of 1865. On February 1, 1865 Robinson sent a letter to President Abraham Lincoln in which he argued against granting slaves the land and freedoms promised to them by the victorious Union General William Tecumseh Sherman in Special Field Order No.15. Robinson reasoned that the slaves did not have the necessary skills to function independently. As quoted from his letter, In cases where the negros planted their own land with cotton they were often too lazy to pick it when ripe, and refused to allow others to do so on the most liberal terms and the cotton rotted in the field. He viewed the land to be too agriculturally valuable to let go to waste. In <em>Rehearsal for Reconstruction</em>, Willie Lee Rose discusses a possible reason for this lack of work ethic amongst the former slaves. While enslaved, blacks received no cash reward for growing cotton. Upon being freed, they naturally focused their agricultural efforts on cultivating and sustaining crops such as corn and potatoes; harvests they knew would help them survive. Cotton served no purpose - agriculturally or economically - to the formerly enslaved. As quoted from Rehearsal for Reconstruction, The advantages of the year-long tyranny of Sea-Island cotton had not been readily apparent to the simple people who had never received a cash reward for growing it. "," Special Field Order No. 15, enacted on January 16, 1865, reserved, as quoted directly, The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice-fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the St. John?s River, Florida for the settlement of negroes. The order was passed by Sherman and made use of land the Union army had seized near the end of the Civil War following his destructive March to the Sea. The majority of the land included in the order had previously belonged to white plantation owners yet it was nevertheless set-aside for former slaves. Special Field Order No. 15 is commonly referred to as the 40 acres and a mule act. Robinson's final point in his letter to Lincoln was that when Congress eventually decided to sell the land, the inhabitants would be left homeless. He was not against giving African Americans land; rather, he believed that such a vast amount of land should be properly managed instead of wasted by those who had neither the skill nor the intention of using it."],"display_date":"February 1, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-01","locations":[{"id":1510,"lat":31.6956666643,"lng":-82.2948071414,"zoom":9,"place":"APPLING, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3401,"title":"A Lyncher Is Revealed\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-07-02","end_date":"1896-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mob violence was prevalent in the Southern United States towards the turn of the twentieth Century. Noah B. Jones, who had been thought to be a victim of a mob attack in turn was identified as an actually lyncher, stifled by a defensive blow from a Mr. Maxwell. Jones and his party had come to Maxwell's house to terrorize him, and in turn was struck down by Maxwell with an ax in self defense. Maxwell recognized others in the gang as well, which would have led to their prosecution if it turns out that Maxwell testified against them. If that were the case, it would have leveled the chance that at least some of the lynchers would be brought to justice. To the public, the case most likely would have revealed participation from several men in the town.","At the heart of this story, the South's paradox between being part of the Union by abiding in governmental law and procedure and that of lynch law, which allowed individuals of the South to take the law into their own hands. After the Civil War and Reconstruction, many individuals in the South, in effort to reclaim pride and status, were hesitant to yield to the law, and as an informal code of behavior emerged, it required white men to respond to challenges to their honor by acting outside of the law. Lynching during the turn of the century could be seen as a legacy reminiscent of the years of slavery in which slave states offered Southern plantation owners the widest powers over their slaves in which punishment was at their own discretion. But as the North flourished through economic development, the growth of cities required a dependable exercise of state authority. This created tension within the South, where a majority of white individuals would rather resist legal institutions which might have challenged their discretion. In many cases southern mobs began pursuing their attacks in clothing which would protect their identities, however in this case governmental law overpowers."],"display_date":"July 2, 1896","search_date":"1896-07-02","locations":[{"id":12437,"lat":35.6786687827,"lng":-85.7785035282,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3405,"title":"The Price on a Life\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-02-26","end_date":"1849-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Daily habits, such as flipping through a newspaper, must have been hard on an anti-slavery southerner. The newspapers prior to the Civil War are full of reminders that not all people were in fact equal. Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD. My man GILES, who calls himself GILES BURLEY, left my plantation in Louisa County, Virginia, on the 3rd day of January. He has gone over the mountains, in company with some of the many hirelings.

The traders were not considered to be the nicest of men, but it was a business, and they were in it to make money. Local traders would start small, and gradually build their enterprises. Sales were commonly made from farm to farm within a region. An ad directly above the aforementioned runaway notice declared a sale of slaves because of the owner's death. The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9. It is presumed that this family would be split among different farms in the region; a reality that was a constant incentive for slaves to behave. ","With the Compromise of 1850 came a tightening of the Fugitive Slave Act. Anyone who helped a slave escape would be punished. Northern abolitionists found this to be preposterous; in fact, both the North and the South hated the compromise.

Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

The only trouble was that the United States government had not declared war against Spain. In fact, the governments of the United States and Spain were currently attempting to ratify a treaty outlining once and for all the borders between American Louisiana and Spanish Texas. This band of adventurers did not have the authority to attack Texas, and yet, until the end of July of that year, news of military preparation against Texas persistently crept east to Baltimore, Boston, and Washington, D.C. On July 19, the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> poked fun at the brazen upstarts, who they believed to have been duped into joining the expedition to fight along side the famous guerilla leader, Xavier Mina.","Xavier Mina was forced to flee Spain in 1814 when he opposed the restored Spanish monarch, Ferdinand VII. Mina then attempted to attack Ferdinand VII through an invasion of Spanish Mexico. His efforts were thwarted and he was executed by firing squad on November 11, 1817. A contingent of his force against the Spanish was led by American Colonel Henry Perry. Perry also died in the attempted coup; only four of his men escaped the battle that claimed their commander's life and eventually made their way to Natchitoches, Louisiana. ","Presumably, it was these survivors, and other Americans like them who had lived under and fought against the Spanish government in Texas, that rallied their neighbors in a renewed revolutionary attempt, calling on the name of Mina to consolidate support for their cause. While the <em>Intelligencer </em>felt compelled to certify Xavier Mina's death and express annoyance over the third attempt to resurrect him in the name of raising recruits, the <em>Baltimore Telegraph</em> vehemently supported the expedition. Texas of right the paper boomed, is the property of the U. States, acquired by the treaty which ceded Louisiana to this country.

As he is mentioned in a letter to James Perry, who had a number of business interests in Texas, it is probable that he was there in a role of some relation to James Perry's investments. Unfortunately for Perry, the winter of 1831 was the worst winter that Texas had experienced for several years. Upon disembarking from his boat, he intended to venture further on into the settlements, but was detained for four days by bad weather and high water. Perry was, of course, not the only one to suffer from the adverse weather conditions and their effects on the local road systems. ","William Hunter, James Perry's agent who had been running his business in Texas commented upon the economically pernicious results of the impassable roadways. Hunter related to James Perry that he had only been able to transport two loads of their goods up from the river where they were deposited by boat. He declared that he was verry much disappointed in getting hauling done because a team that had started to the river for a load the previous week had returned empty-handed. He further noted that one or two teams were mired down on the roadways at the time. This development was clearly economically damaging, as Hunter could not sell goods that he didn't have in his possession. He lamented that if his goods had arrived before the bad weather, he could have done a good business. Like the financial fortunes of Perry and Hunter, the economic well being of the South was highly dependent on roads and other means of transportation. Well-kept roads were crucial for the shipment of goods, especially from rural areas to urban centers where they could be sold or shipped to larger markets. As a result, local governments communities throughout the South put much emphasis on road maintenance even at a time where municipal services were few. An excellent example of this facet of community cooperation occurred in Virginia's Prince Edward County. As noted in Israel on the Appomatox, the Prince Edward county court expended considerable effort responding to petitions for new roadways. Also, county surveyors, or citizens in charge of certain sections of road were enlisted for general maintenance of thoroughfares. These surveyors had the power to conscript other men's slaves (and free blacks) for several days each year in the interest of improving roads. The yearly cleanup allowed for uninhibited commerce along the county's highways and byways. Because the economy of the South produced primarily agricultural goods that had to be shipped for sale, good systems of transportation were crucial. In addition to roads, transportation throughout the South was carried out by other means such as boats or, later on, railroads. However, at the time of Perry's detainment by muddy paths, Texas was little more than a collection of settlements strung together by roads that were clearly inadequate for year-round business."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3454,"title":"Technological Progress in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["New Orleans' geographical location made it a prime final destination for all sorts of shipable goods. The city had become one of the premier metropolises of not only the state but also the entire South, thanks to the convergence of the Mississippi with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the abundance of water routes, the need for other methods of transportation grew along with the city. Far from being the lazy South that has been romanticized in literature, this part of the country was bustling with trade and a rapid trend towards efficiency. Out of that desire, a minority within the Louisiana Committee on Internal Improvements took it upon themselves to investigate the complete installation of a railroad line connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This committee published a Minority Report in 1853 urging the state legislature to approve immediate funding of this line. Forty-six of the ninety-one mile stretch between the two cities had already been constructed and were in daily use, so it was just a matter of completing the job previously begun. The committee agreed that the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Railroad is a work of great public utility and that the line... is superior to that of any railroad in the state. They claimed that, upon completion of the railroad, travel time between the cities would be reduced to a mere three hours, and at a cost of just 3 per ride. Not only would this be an advantage to anyone living in either Baton Rouge or New Orleans, but it would be particularly beneficial to members of legislature. The railroad could now afford them the opportunity to attend their meetings at shorter notice and still be home by nightfall.","The South was truly growing at a rapid rate, and the addition of a railroad line portrays that growth quite clearly. No longer were waterways sufficient; faster overland travel was a necessary addition to the well-being of Louisiana's inhabitants. The scramble to improve transportation was being seen all over the young country, so much so that the national government became involved. Congress bequeathed land to states for the express purpose of improving travel routes, and Louisiana was no exception. Congress agreed to grant 100,000 acres to its railroad construction, knowing that the state's eventual gains meant that their economic loss would not be sustained for long.

The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3464,"title":"The Development of a Judicial System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Keep little or no money about you or in your trunk, John Bisland advised his son in a letter between the two, since you left this place our negro peer got a key and opened my trunk, he had robbed me of about 900 dollars.

Not only was the court house a place of law it was also the center of southern communities and a common place where citizens gambled, drank, brawled, listened to oratorical fights of rhetoric, and debated politics.","As the development of courts became a greater priority in American society so did issues concerning the decisions and decision makers in court. There were many debates regarding the process of convicting felons and whether the jury should make the final decision in cases or if judge should have the ultimate say. An article in a local Tennessee paper stated that because the trial by jury is guaranteed by the constitution, the judgments of the jurors must remain untrammeled to their minds but also to the actual law. ","The fact that the law was such a dominant part of nineteenth century life, creating sufficient jails was necessary in order to house convicted felons. In Adams county escapes from poorly constructed jails were so frequent, the sheriff was forced to adopt methods seen as inhuman in order to maintain security. New jails were needed and the architects who designed these structures put great time and thought into creating the safest, most secure facilities possible. Jail plans in Wilkinson County proposed the building to be 40 feet by 24 feet... with the external wall to be built of well burnt brick, two feet thick. Problems with the rapidly growing population played a large role in the design of these facilities especially after multiple embarrassing incidents regarding overcrowded jails had been reported. Because of these issues, in 1822, circuit judges were required to conduct or oversee examinations of jails at least once a year to make sure there were not any outstanding concerns that needed to be fixed.","Along with the costs necessary to construct and maintain court houses and jail facilities it was very expensive to imprison people who had broken the law. One governor of Mississippi demanded immediate trials and banned undetermined times of imprisonment due to the amount of money it cost to hold these prisoners in jail. Other measures were taken towards a similar direction and in 1822 a Mississippi governor allowed all prisoners except the ones who were being held for felonies to walk out of the jail as long the jury believed that they would abide by the decisions made in county court. Breaking the law was a sizeable problem in the nineteenth century and the state of Mississippi worked hard to provide the most appropriate punishment to convicted felons."],"display_date":"1817 - 1822","search_date":"1820-01-01","locations":[{"id":6935,"lat":31.1786199617,"lng":-90.7973265096,"zoom":9,"place":"AMITE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3471,"title":"Mr. Brown and the Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-13","end_date":"1831-01-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mr. Brown's absence was a strain on the family that he left behind. Taking care of day-to-day business without a husband and father in the rough settlement of San Felipe de Austin was not an easy feat. The pressures upon the family increased as time went by, and the news of him they received after his absence spanned one month was not heartening. Brown was taking part in an exploration of the upper colonies of Texas, and his party's horses were stolen in an Indian raid. However, the settlers vowed to pursue the marauders and not to return until their stolen property was recovered. Additionally disturbing was the fact that Indians had recently committed several such attacks in the upper colonies. ","The fact that even in the sparsely populated lands of Mexico's northern colonies Brown and other Anglo-Americans were involved in conflicts with Indians was indicative of the Indians' struggles within the United States. Interestingly, the Indians of the upper colonies were not all native to the area. In fact, as a result of persecution within the United States, many of the Indians with whom the Anglo-American settlers interacted were displaced members of the Cherokee tribe. After the American Revolution, a large number of Cherokee left their traditional homes in the southeastern part of the United States, and moved west to Louisiana, then owned by the far more welcoming Spanish. As time passed, more and more Cherokee who found their eastern homes encroached upon by white settlers joined their tribal brethren to the west. Following the U.S. purchase of Louisiana, many Cherokee again moved, now seeking to live under the friendlier Spanish government in Texas. As time passed, Anglo-American settlers as well as the Spanish government again threatened the Cherokee Indians. Cherokee leaders actually applied for a formal land grant in order to legally secure their lands from other settlers, but they correctly interpreted repeated delays in their application's approval as a portent of eventual rejection. By 1826, the Cherokee were desperate enough to take part in an armed insurrection against the Mexican government, along with some Anglo-American settlers and other indigenous groups. The revolt was crushed by Mexican troops with the aid of volunteers from the more established American colonies. ","The plight of the Cherokee in Texas was merely a later chapter in their great struggle resulting from the colonization of their native lands. Throughout the history of the South, Indians occupied large portions of the region's soil and directly influenced politics, agriculture, and other aspects of Southern life. It was not until approximately 30 years before the Civil War that the Indian populations of the South were forcibly removed from the area. However, with the continual westward movement of settlers, political and physical conflict between Anglo-Americans and Indians would continue to be a factor in shaping the country for years to come."],"display_date":"January 13, 1831","search_date":"1831-01-13","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3478,"title":"Settlers and Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-02","end_date":"1830-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The steamboat made it safely over the sand bar and arrived at the mouth of the Brazos River in Texas. Upon landing, William Hunter quickly composed a letter to his business associate James Perry to give tidings of his safe arrival. Hunter noted to Perry the presence of 30 Negroes on board and wrote of his plan to inquire of the owner, a settler from Alabama, about the means of their transport into the Mexican territory that was Texas. Hunter clearly expressed interest in importing slaves to Texas, and he was not an inconsequential businessman. Perry, the recipient of his letter, was the brother-in-law of Stephen Austin, the most important player in Anglo-American settlement of Texas, and Hunter conducted business with both of these men. ","Though Hunter's life is poorly documented, much is known about his traveling companion, Stephen Austin. Austin's father, Moses Austin, originally negotiated with the Spanish government to secure a land grant and to bring 300 Anglo-American settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated northern reaches of Spain's North American possessions. Upon Moses Austin's death in 1821 (the same year that Mexico gained independence), the grant passed to Stephen Austin. The specific attention given by Hunter (and presumably shared by Austin) to the importation of slaves into Texas is of great interest due to its place in a primarily business-related letter and the early date at which it occurs. It appears that like other parts of the American South, slavery in Texas was associated with business and profit, regardless of slaveholders' professions of paternalistic sentiment toward enslaved people. Also, the fact that slaves were brought into Texas at such an early stage in Anglo-American settlement is important as it affected later national politics. ","The Mexican government, in fact, frowned upon the form of slavery found in the United States. All slaves in Mexico were legally emancipated in 1829, however Austin's powerful friends managed to secure an exemption from this law for Texas. In composing the Civil and Criminal Regulations that governed his colony, the laws regarding slavery were the only ones imported directly from codes in the American South. Such Anglo-American support of slavery at the highest levels demonstrates both the pervasive nature of the institution and the reason that it eventually became such an issue of contention. In the years before Texas joined the United States, the annexation debate was influenced by Texas's possible status as a slaveholding state. Reminiscent of the conditions that necessitated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Northern residents and anti-slavery forces were concerned with the balance of power shared by slaveholding and non-slaveholding states. In 1844 Democrat James K. Polk ran on a platform of annexing Texas and re-occupying Oregon, a bid to please both North and South. Thus, Hunter's seemingly innocuous comment regarding slaves being brought into Texas was actually a portent of turbulence to come."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3509,"title":"A Falling Deck of Cards: The Panic of 1819\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-06-15","end_date":"1819-06-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Citizens of Staunton, Virginia came together June 15, 1819 to navigate the pitfalls of the antebellum economy.

The situation was made more precarious as people became cavalier with their debts: it was a time of economic booms, and great speculation in the South.

George Blow, a Douglas Democrat, L.H. Chandler, a Bell man, and Maj. William Lamb, a Breckinridge supporter, the discussion quickly disintegrated into personal insults between Mr. Lamb and Mr. Chandler. The <em>Herald</em> wrote that Lamb, might have spared some of the gross ribaldry and vituperation which he unnecessarily and we should think injudiciously heaped upon the [Constitutional] Union party, and that when he was understood to say that no honest man could attach himself to such a party...[it] was felt by hundreds present as a direct personal insult, and resented by a storm of hisses.

To which Chandler then shouted, ...sir, you are a d----d infernal liar And, as the paper so delicately put it, it was here the parties came into a collision...the blows seemed to those nearest the spot to have been almost simultaneous. This exchange of punches prompted supporters of each man to rush to the stage.

The border states held the closest ties to their neighbors to the north and therefore felt the rift between the two regions most deeply. And it was here that the rift in the Democratic Party was felt most intensely. Breckinridge was supported by the Deep South, as he was a vocal proponent of slavery and its expansion. Those closer to the border were wary of his rhetoric, however, and Virginia was especially unenthusiastic. Stephen Douglas was more acceptable in this region, as he was dedicated to the preservation of the union. John Bell, the candidate of the Constitutional Union party, an organization dedicated to avoiding secession, also had a large following. The main issue was slavery. The South wanted a permanent guarantee of its continued preservation and expansion to new states in the form of a Constitutional amendment. This proposal was absolutely opposed by the North, who feared the political power that the slave states would hold if new states that welcomed slavery were allowed into the union. Though every Democrat in the South demanded a right to slavery forever, their differences in the area caused more conflict than unity. It was this conflict that allowed for the victory of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate, who took office with a minority of the popular vote. And it was this event that prompted the Cotton Belt states to secede, but the deep divisions among southerners, evident in this episode, delayed Virginia from immediately following suit.

Four years earlier, the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> ran a little piece explaining just how much Virginia, and especially Augusta County was stacked against Clay's rival, Andrew Jackson. James Madison and James Monroe are opposed to the election of gen. Jackson...John Marshall is opposed...four out five judges of the high court of appeals are opposed to gen. Jackson.

The calling up of those who had been given light duty is another indication of the manpower problems the South was facing in the waning days of the Civil War. Light duty was usually assigned to those who had been previously injured or otherwise declared unfit for active service. The Confederacy had only about six more months of existence by October of 1864, but the government was doing everything it could possibly do to survive.","By 1864, however, a quarter to a third of the soldiers east of the Mississippi River were conscripts.

","Like any other city, murder and crime were facets of life in Charleston; however, it was not a huge problem for the antebellum city. In fact, the problems of regulating crime were more centered on slaves and free blacks rather than whites. Whether a white person or a black person killed Mr. Wienand is not known. However, it was quite apparent that as time wore on, white members of Charleston society who committed crimes were subjected to more lenient punishments than their black counterparts. In fact, city leaders became so worried about slaves and free African Americans committing crimes that the Charleston Work House was established in 1839. That year, the Work House became a house of correction for slaves. In addition to becoming a place for the punishment of slaves who committed various offenses or crimes, the Work House was also established so that the city would have a central place for a slave market. The work house was run under Spartan conditions and in a correctional manner. Many considered it a deterrent to committing crimes. No one wanted to go to the Work House. In addition, it was designed in a Gothic Revival style, similar to that of many churches built after the Great Fire of 1838, serving as a reminder that the righteous did not commit crimes like that one that was so cruelly bestowed on Mr. Wienand. ","Judging from the murder of Charleston hotel manager Joseph Wienand, one would assume Charleston was unsafe. However, as Maurie McInnis points out in a chapter of her book, <em>The Politics of Taste in Antebellum Charleston</em>, crime was greatly controlled in Charleston during the 1830s and 1840s, thanks in large part to fear of being incarcerated in the Work House. Most Charlestonians need not worry that they would be victims like Mr. Wienand."],"display_date":"October 29, 1832","search_date":"1832-10-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3532,"title":"Charleston Women Discuss Support of States Rights\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-07","end_date":"1833-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women like Laura Margaret Cole Smith of South Carolina were not blind to the implications of politics for the Union as a whole. Upon receiving news of the 1832 Nullification Crisis, Laura wrote to her cousin Camille explaining her opinions on the state of the Union. Smith held steadfastly to her belief in South Carolina's states rights. Although the prospect of war saddened her because her father and brothers would have to fight, she believed that it was important for South Carolina to preserve its liberty instead of conceding to the Union. South Carolina was discussing war and succession far before states like Virginia.","The Nullification Crisis was not the first time that the slavery/anti-slavery debate had threatened American political stability. In signing the Tariff Act of 1832, President Andrew Jackson pushed a previous tariff struggle that had been brewing between South Carolina and the federal government to a climax. Tariffs previously established in 1828 had been deemed by South Carolinians unconstitutional because they taxed imported goods, which were popular in the states, more heavily than those made in the North. In the view of many South Carolina planters, the North was being favored by this tariff, and the economic problems of the Carolina rice culture were being ignored. In addition, they saw themselves as unnecessarily persecuted because South Carolina was a slave state. Jackson signed a new Tariff Act in 1832 that lowered the tax somewhat; however, South Carolinians had hoped he would do away with the law all together. In November 1832, the South Carolina assembly came together in a special session to declare the tariffs null and void in South Carolina. It became a struggle of states rights versus federal rights, now known as the Nullification Crisis. ","Letters like Smith's of January 1833 also show that Southern women before the Civil War were required to be involved enough in political affairs to be able to support their husband's or father's political opinions. Their opinions were usually congruent with that of the male members of the families. Sally G. McMillen confirms that women were expected to have the same views as the men in their families in her article Women in the Old South. Interestingly, in Harry L. Watson's long description of the Nullification Crisis in his book Liberty and Power, he does not even allude to women being involved in the political front at all, because, quite frankly, they were not. Although women could discuss politics and support the opinions of their families' males, they did not have a say in politics and were not allowed to vote, showing that women were expected to fulfill the traditional female role of family caregiver. Laura addressed her father and brother in the beginning of the letter; they were absent from the home, and she wished for their return, showing how much she cared for them. Speculation leads us to the conclusion that they were dealing with the nullification crisis in a political context. In addition, she commented that she had discussed the issue of nullification in private with the gentlemen in her life; they were grateful for her support."],"display_date":"January 7, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-07","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3539,"title":"Mississippi Congressman Calls for the Annexation of Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-20","end_date":"1845-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, the national debate over the annexation of the young country of Texas into the Union was in full swing.  Politicians stood on either side of the debate, effectively representing their constituents in the matter.  John Henderson, a Congressman from Mississippi, gave a speech to Congress on February 20, 1845, in which he outlined all of the reasons why the Union should annex Texas.  As Congress waited for his speech, Henderson prepared to explain why the addition of Texas would be in the best interest of the country, as well as his constituents. The motives Henderson gave Congress in support of his opinion were very diplomatic in nature, and effectively called on the language of the Constitution.  The underlying reasons, however, represent his attention to Mississippi in his decisions.  Frederick Merk outlined these reasons in his article A Safety Valve Thesis and Texan Annexation, which was published in <em>The Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>.  Merk said that northern abolitionists, such as Benjamin Lundy, maintained that the entire process of migration, defiance of Mexican law, and revolution, had been a southern conspiracy to extend the area of slavery.  This extremist view shows the contrast between the North and South in relation to the annexation of Texas.  As Merk stated, Henderson wished to obtain more land for his constituents, as well as have complete control of the Mississippi Valley.     Henderson wanted to represent his constituents well, which meant that he should help them achieve more land to expand and develop into farms and plantations.  There was plenty of land in Texas, and the people from Mississippi were very eager to exploit it for personal profit, which so happened to involve the spread of slavery west of Louisiana.

He was from New York, and needless to say, felt out of place and different among the southerners.  Baldwin was a lawyer, and in his book about his travels, Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi, he takes most of his time explaining the legal matters of the places he visited. Baldwin stopped in the rural western Mississippi county of Noxubee and experienced a court case that would have him perplexed for months to come.  Due to the lack of development in this area, there is only one courthouse in the county, and one must make his way to the courthouse on very rough roads.  Mr. Onslow, as he is referred to by Baldwin, had come on horseback from the Mississippi Swamp, on no other business than to attend to this case.  His preparation was arduous and thorough   his zeal apostolic.  Baldwin clearly portrays his shock regarding the manner in which this southern countryman from the swamp had taken to his business in court.  The underlying theme is the presence of the stereotypes which followed Baldwin on his trek down to the heart of the South. ","On the surface, Onslow was just another uneducated southerner who owned slaves, and was out to expand his enterprise.  Once Baldwin allowed himself to get past Onslow's ruggedness, a very articulate and learned man greeted him. These predetermined stereotypes presented many problems between the North and South during the years preceding the Civil War.  The North viewed the South as uneducated slave holders, who would rather enslave black people rather than do the work themselves.  Mark Smith argues that the elites of the North tried to educate the southerners in the ways of economics and free enterprise.  The southerners saw this as a sign of disrespect, which further enlarged the gap between the two social and geographic groups.  It was very difficult for either side to listen to each other, due to the predetermined stereotypes illustrated in many of Baldwin's entries regarding his travels.  He does, however, make an effort to rid himself of the stereotypes, but they are still evident in his writings, which would characterize the typical northerner's views of a southerner.  These stereotypes led to social hardships and a general disdain for the other portion of the country in the mid nineteenth century."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":7200,"lat":33.1101145617,"lng":-88.569790999,"zoom":9,"place":"NOXUBEE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3552,"title":"Support for Jackson \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-01-01","end_date":"1819-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In March of 1818, Jackson invaded Florida, brought down Fort Negro, and seized parts of Florida, which was under Spanish control. Jackson's actions caused international repercussions. Spain protested the invasion, which led to the halt of negotiations to buy Spanish Florida. The invasion, also, led Britain to protest the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered the United State territory, and led Congress to hold hearings to discuss the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials and to decide what to do about Jackson's actions. ","Representative Cobb of Georgia introduced resolutions condemning Jackson's actions in the House in 1819. Shortly after, Representative Tallmadge gave a speech, as well, on the Seminole War, where he showed his support for Jackson's actions and his opposition for the resolutions. Other representatives such as Henry Clay showed opposition for Jackson while others supported Jackson's actions such as Representative Holmes. Both Homles and Clay along with many other representatives delivered their speeches on the issue at hand. After every representative, who wanted to speak, spoke, Jackson ended up being victorious once again, but instead of being victorious on Florida soil, he was now victorious in the House of Representatives. ","Jackson was too popular for the resolutions to pass and some of the representatives knew this fact. Some opponents who knew about Jackson's popularity did not want to give in to the assumption of Jackson's popularity. Yet, the Representatives' outcomes were in accordance with the public's opinion. If it were up to the citizens to deliver speeches, there is a good chance that Jackson would have gained support for his actions since the majority of public opinion claimed Jackson was a hero.

News of the debate on the resolutions and the outcome in the House of Representatives were in newspapers all over the United States letting everyone know, even the settlers in Florida, what they would anticipate. In addition, the fact that the resolutions failed to pass was important to history because it meant that tensions between the Seminoles and white settlers would only increase. Shortly after, the Indians began to retaliate and attack white settlers in Florida and Georgia. ","If the resolutions would have gained more support and passed, it was possible that the continuation of the Seminole Wars might not have occurred or would have occurred at a different time changing history, as we know it.

He claimed, however, that the passage of the bill for black suffrage was almost unanimously rejected by the white race. He complained of the fact that the black right to vote had been acceptingly repudiated in several northern states, and yet, it was forced upon the people in Washington against their will. He then went on to say how this would lead to a negative effect upon the white workingmen of the District of Columbia., as it would bring the blacks to an equal footing with them.

A staunch abolitionist, Brown was the first white American to set about culling up a slave insurrection. He first gained the nation's attention when he led a volunteer militia during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of the previous decade. Following his involvement in that conflict, Brown was responsible for the direction of the Pottawatomie Massacre on May 24, 1856 and subsequently freed eleven slaves in the neighboring state of Missouri. What he is best remembered for, however, is his participation in the famous raid on a federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in modern-day West Virginia. The anti-slavery espousals and violent methods of John Brown incited neighboring Virginian counties into action; according to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, Brown's well-known raid on Harpers Ferry occasioned wild excitement, a good deal of local apprehension, and was, indeed, the alarum gun of the war that so soon followed.","John Brown's incendiary actions caused the immediate organization and equipment of numerous volunteer companies throughout the state of Virginia. One of these militias originated in Orange County, the self-proclaimed Montpelier Guards, of whom many are memorialized in the lists of Confederate soldiers buried in Charlottesville cemeteries. They were characterized by Scott as a fine volunteer company [that organized themselves] at and about Orange Courthouse. Led by Captain Lewis B. Williams, Jr., the Montpelier Guards traveled to Charleston, South Carolina where they stood guard until Brown and such of his accomplices as had been caught were hanged. Although they did not participate in the capture of Brown himself, their presence in Charleston thwarted the rumored attempts his rescue during the term of his imprisonment. Nevertheless, the company was Brown's military escort to the scaffold where he was hanged for treason to the state of Virginia. ","The Montpelier Guard of Orange County, Virginia served as an example for several other county-organized militias of the 1850s, including the Gordonsville Greys, led by Captain William C. Scott, and the Barboursville Guard, who operated under the command of Captain W.S. Parran. These companies, following in the footsteps of Williams' men, were uniformed, and began regular drills in preparation for the direful conflict which everybody felt was coming, indeed was almost come. John Brown's controversial actions galvanized the nation either in support or condemnation of his efforts.

Civilized countries recognized the need of foreign trade to compete in this new arena. Foreign trade required the participation of everyone from government leaders to common citizens. A Florida resident, Cecil H. Alleyne expressed his concern over a Yellow Fever breakout and its effects on the world market. In his letter to the London Times in 1886 Alleyne describes the gravity of the disease in Jacksonville, Florida. ","Without health care systems or emergency rooms, Florida tried to deal with a Yellow Fever epidemic in the late nineteenth century. Subsequently, the disease ravaged parts of Florida including Key West, Manatee, Tampa, and Plant City. In Jacksonville alone by 1888 the disease had claimed 427 lives out of 4,656 reported cases. To try and tame the disease several cities set huge fires of pine and tar in an effort to cleanse contaminated areas. The Jacksonville Sanitary Association managed to raise 350,000 to fight the disease. At every level of government, Florida tried to control Yellow Fever from spreading. The mayor of Jacksonville quarantined areas in an effort to limit the outbreak of disease. Alleyne believed the quarantine and relief efforts that Florida put into effect successfully restricted the disease. One of the more radical approaches against the disease came in 1889 by Florida governor Francis P. Fleming. Fleming pushed for the creation of a state health board to regulate health problems and fight the yellow fever outbreak. Consequently, a new state constitution was created in 1887 putting Fleming's suggestions into legislation.","Alleyne's letter to the London Times Editor connects Florida to England in the world trade market. Alleyne felt that an outbreak of Yellow Fever was important enough to write the leading newspaper in London, illustrating the dependence of both parties for each other's imports and exports. In addition, Alleyne was able to paint a picture of how difficult life on the frontier was in the nineteenth century. Seminole attacks, outbreaks of disease, and aggressive Spanish inhabitants were everyday threats that Florida citizens had to cope with. Nevertheless, the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Florida produced a new state constitution and the creation of the Florida State Health Board.

"," Mary Ryan has written that during the nineteenth century, the contests for public spaces were an indicator of the spread of democratic politics, but as Wayne Durrill pointed out, democracy itself did not necessarily spread just because people wanted to control these public spaces. Lynchings, for example, occurred in public places and are not indicative of spreading democracy. The city of Staunton recognized the importance of the courthouse and its strong role in the community. In the past, Staunton citizens prided themselves for their gas and music. They needed an equally impressive courthouse that could reflect the citizens' feelings of importance.

M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3600,"title":"Congress Returns to the Capitol\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-01-01","end_date":"1882-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the winter of 1882, Frank G.

There was everything from quiet, demure hotels for politicians who wished to be close to the White House to more raucous, lively hotels where you might find Congressmen bantering the night away. Frank knew where he could find someone in D.C. when Congress was in session. ","This session was marked with particular excitement for two reasons. First, the Democrats had become the majority party in the House of Representatives; second, the national election was right around the corner so Congressmen and aspiring politicians were already hard at work, campaigning for their very near futures. Frank was thrilled to be in the capital at a time like this one. ","Frank G. Carpenter was an author during the 19th century who traveled and wrote commentary pieces on life and society around the world. What he saw in 1882 in Washington D.C. is quite revealing about the dynamic between the city and the Congressmen, as well as between the Congressmen, and other visitors, themselves. Naturally, the city took complete advantage of Congress being in session every year. The influx meant more business, more money, more intrigue - more everything. Between the visitors and between the Congressmen it was very interesting that party lines were very much a function of geographic origin, and even more so, were very segregating. This polarization Carpenter witnessed supports a piece of historian Vincent P. De Santis' view of the political scene at the time, which involved the proliferation of Independent politicians as the parties strengthened. Men split from their parties in attempts to induce real change. The parties had become political machines, facing off with one another on every level, incapable of reacting in kind to the actual issues that confronted the federal government."],"display_date":1882,"search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3601,"title":"Frederick Douglass Addresses the New American Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-02-20","end_date":"1884-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Prohibition Convention of 1884 was held in Lincoln Hall and kicked off on the evening of February 20th.  Several prominent politicians, bureaucrats, religious leaders and thought leaders of the time were present to help usher the American Party into the upcoming election season. Mr. E.D. Bailey, who had just been appointed to the committee responsible for nominating a President and Vice President of the United States, spoke first and set the tone for the evening by highlighting a few key themes of critical importance to the American Party:  the party's firm foundation in Jesus Christ's vision of Democracy, the growing need for temperance and prohibition, the threat of Freemasonry on the nation, and the highly objectionable way in which Republicans seemed to appeal to the black community simply to win votes before elections.  ","With the mood perfectly set for his address, Mr. Frederick Douglass took the stage to present his speech on civil rights. We have got rid of slavery. It is gone, gone, gone, never to return. But its long black shadow stretches across our entire continent...You ask sometimes when this negro question will cease...It will cease when we have one country, one citizenship, one liberty, one equality for all people...  He then spoke to the issue of colonization, heatedly denouncing it as a unthinkable solution to the problem of racial inequality. He asserted that black people wanted to take part in the freedom and progress that was so unique to the United States, a nation that they were as much a part of as white men. In fact, he elaborated humorously, many whites and blacks may be closer in relation than they might think given the history of interracial relationships in America He even indicated to his largely male audience that, in general, men could learn something from the more compassionate and respectful attitudes of women, who he had known to show the kind of sensitivity and care necessary to bridging the gaps between the white and black races. Every last one of his words was met with applause, laughter, admission, understanding, and approbation by all those in the hall, white and black alike. ","Retrospectively, this speech which occurred in 1884 came at a hugely significant time in the history of race relations in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional less than six months before it was presented at the convention of the American Party. By 1885, as historian Valeria W. Weaver explains, the 'Jim Crow' South was really taking shape, severely impeding if not stopping in its tracks, the push toward the equality between whites and blacks that was the foundation of Douglass' mission."],"display_date":"February 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3605,"title":"Commencement at Howard Draws an Illustrious Crowd\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-05-01","end_date":"1879-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It wasn't every day after the Civil War that former slaves and former slave-owners would admit to having something in common, much less celebrate it openly. But in the early summer of 1879 at the commencement exercises for Howard University, they did just that. The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites. Historian Michael Dennis explains that white Southerners realized the necessity of educating the newly emancipated African-American population in order for them to be able to sustain themselves; however, most were only in support of their education if it was separate from that of the white population."],"display_date":"May 1, 1879 - May 30, 1879","search_date":"1879-05-15","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3606,"title":"A Call to the Free-Holders of Rowan and Davie Counties\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-06-22","end_date":"1844-06-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["People in town were gathered around a newspaper with the political platforms for the upcoming Presidential election.  The candidate that seemed to care the most about the people of the county, especially the farmers was A.G. Carter.  He had been the Senator here for twelve years so if he anything he had the experience to make the best politician.  He promised to not burden people with taxes anymore and to vote for a Senator who will have the best interest of the people and county at heart. Carter seemed so honest and straightforward-the way people in North Carolina want to be represented, and he promised to vote for the good, old traditional Republican doctrines. Carter also claimed in his letter that people needed to fight the annexation of Texas, and reclaim this as American land by negotiating a Treaty with Spain.  Texas was a large piece of territory for our people to settle and this could mean a stronger country.  Carter spoke for common folks, announcing that he would work for the best prices and not let politicians deceive people into paying high prices for cheap goods.  Carter appealed to parental concerns by reminding voters of how defective the education system had become; apparently the people of Rowan are not getting the large amount of money that went into a fund for the state to use on education, and if that money went to the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Co.  citizens would have to pay taxes directly on it.  This didn't seem fair to the people of North Carolina, especially the children who needed opportunities for education in order to get better jobs, and the railroad certainly didn't provide jobs for all the people of North Carolina. Carter said that there was too much legislation instead of too little, and a lot of people agreed judging by the reactions in his letter published in the daily paper. ","Railroad companies and education competed for state funding.  Although many citizens of North Carolina were still self employed, agriculture being the dominant economy of the South, there was an influx of funding from Southern states into their technological and industrial advances in order to keep up with Northern urban economies.  This is consistent with the views of William Cooper and Thomas Terrill, historians who claimed that significant growth in the later antebellum periods, spurred by the Panic of 1837, severely depressed cotton prices until the mid-1840s, leaving the South considerably underdeveloped in comparison with Northern states.  This was due to resistance from Southern politicians, who garnered support and funding for issues that were intangible for many citizens.  However, the South did benefit from participation in industrialization due to the fact that crops and textiles could be more widely distributed in more convenient, quicker ways.  This was an imperative equalizer to Northern society, but also an essential for Southern growth."],"display_date":"June 22, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-22","locations":[{"id":9412,"lat":35.9291897812,"lng":-80.544596269,"zoom":10,"place":"DAVIE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3608,"title":"Bettie V.

The movement was a period of intense religious activism that trickled down from northern, urban cities and affected Protestant denominations with a heightened sense of social activism. Bettie V. Jones, a resident of Fluvanna County, Virginia, received numerous letters from family and friends, including her husband, William J. Payne, and various other people from and around Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the letters, the Payne family was prominent in the political sphere of central Virginia; included in the letters is a mention of the 1852 Whig convention and the upcoming election, along with a seating chart for the House of Delegates for the 1853-54 session. Jones, a Methodist herself, corresponded with a few Albemarle County residents about the Charlottesville Methodist Church revival, an event that was probably similar to the countless other religious awakenings sweeping the nation that sought to, among other things, counter the assertion that the Bible was fallible. ","Of particular interest to the historian in the collection is a letter addressed to Jones from a family member in Arkansas, a slave state admitted in 1836 on the condition that Michigan was admitted in 1837 as a free state. The issue of runaway slaves is addressed in the letter, a contentious subject that caused a great deal of strife among slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike. The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850, was established in response to the demands from the South for more stringent and detailed Federal legislation concerning the rights of slaveholders and the punishment of runaway slaves. This controversial law further divided those for and against slavery, prompting the increase in the number of abolitionists and the inception and increased efficiency of the Underground Railroad. ","The central tension that is elucidated in the letters to Bettie V. Jones is that of the revivalist spirit and increased moral awareness of southern Americans coupled with the institution of slavery. The collective conscience of the American South was at a crossroads in the 1850s; on one hand, the comfortably profitable lifestyle many southerners had grown accustomed to depended on slave labor as the backbone of their economic system while, conversely, the Third Great Awakening signified a renewal of vigor and strength in relation to the importance of personal religion. In 1845, some slaveholding states left the official Methodist Church to form their own branch, one that condoned slavery on the basis of moral justification by invoking God's will and the examples of slavery in the Bible. The Third Great Awakening focused on the intertwining of religion in the public and private sphere, a relationship that forced both community leaders and citizens to evaluate their beliefs in order to steer clear of hypocrisy. Bettie V. Jones, along with the other central Virginians who experienced the awakening, grappled with the inherent moral and social contradictions presented by religion and slavery that created an unsolvable dilemma, one that only a schism could reconcile."],"display_date":"1849 - 1856","search_date":"1852-12-31","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3610,"title":"Washington Says Farewell to Dick Wallach\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-02-26","end_date":"1881-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 26, 1881, the <em>Evening Star</em> printed an article, 'A Noble Life' about Mr. Richard Wallach. Though he had not yet passed away, the city was already mourning his inevitable passing that was sure to come within days.  The residents of Washington, D.C. had been proud to call Richard Wallach their Mayor for several years, and news of his impending death caused many to reflect on the beneficial impact he had had on the city and the well-being of all who lived in it. ","While he was mayor the City Hall, which had previously acquired the bad name of 'the Buzzard's Roost,' was very unhospitable quarters for the noble army of jobbers and strikers, said the <em>Star</em>, describing how full of integrity Mr. Wallach was. That same day, the <em>National Republican</em> sang his praises in an article entitled, 'Waiting for Death': As a citizen he was enterprising, energetic, liberal, laboring zealously and faithfully for the city, which appreciated his efforts on her behalf. Clearly, 'Dick' Wallach's personal and professional integrity had manifested itself in his mayoral accomplishments; the man had set the bar for mayors in Washington's future.  Mr. Wallach passed away during the afternoon on March 4th, 1881. His funeral was attended by many prominent members of the community, black and white, male and female. ","What made Mr. Wallach's death so monumental to the Washington D.C. community was the fact that he symbolized all that education reform had done and was continuing to do for the community. Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3614,"title":"Amherst County Citizens Petition for a Railroad \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, the period of time between 1848 and 1860 was relatively serene and well-organized in that particular area of central Virginia. Following the United States' triumphant victory in the Mexican War of 1848, one of Virginia's sons and a decorated hero from the war, General Zachary Taylor, was elected President. The era that began in 1850 is known to historians as an age of industrial and public improvement; the legislature and citizenry of Amherst County, for example, petitioned for the construction of a railroad connection between the cities of Lynchburg and Charlottesville. In 1851, the citizens of Amherst County wrote a petition to the governing body in Richmond arguing the position that the state of Virginia would be well-served if a connecting branch was constructed in their district. Citing the unity, consistency, and harmony that would result from the completion of the railroad, they argued eloquently and persuasively in the three-page memorandum. Their request was granted, and the decision to improve public transportation in central Virginia was not without precedent; in the previous year, a section of the Blue Ridge Turnpike was opened to public travel. The roads were engineered by General William Mahone, a man remembered as one of countless connections and political acumen and commemorated by Scott for his exceptional work on the highways.","Transportation during the mid-nineteenth century was still dominated by horsepower, and the opening of the highways provided an easier, more efficient passage through and around the Blue Ridge Mountains. In addition, the Orange and Alexandria railroad company was given special access to a private lot off the turnpike to construct buildings and operate businesses, a provision that would have increased employment opportunities and drawn a more focused attention at that particular intersection of railway and road. In addition to desiring one grand, systematized improvement, the authors of the Amherst County memorandum cited the increased potential for economic prosperity that would surely follow the construction of the connecting branch.","During the 1850s and 1860s, railroad technology was booming. Building on the advancements of earlier rail-related endeavors, such as the Baltimore and Ohio rail line that was the first to evolve into a major system, the railways of mid-century transported not only material goods but also the promise of economic expansion and proliferation. As the railroad snaked its way through the American South, it brought with it untold benefits of increasing population and the amplified opportunity for financial benefit. The construction and opening of roads like the Fredericksburg and Valley Plank Road and the Blue Ridge Turnpike not only facilitated improved travel in central Virginia but also, through its conciliatory provisions with flourishing railroad companies, opened avenues of future economic gain.

Watson enlisted in the Virginia militia and was writing from several locations, including Charleston, South Carolina at Fort Sumter. Built after the War of 1812 as one of a series of fortifications linking the southeastern coast, Fort Sumter fell on April 13, 1861 to Confederate forces under the command of Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard; historically speaking, this battle typically signifies the beginning of the American Civil War. David Watson, however, was writing months before the explosive confrontation in Charleston and the subject matter of his letter details the apprehension over the looming conflict, resilient hope that a peaceful solution could still be achieved, and overwhelming concern for the condition of home life shared by American soldiers who had yet to fall under the polarizing influence of the Civil War. ","In the opening sentences of his letter, Watson gave his mother some bad news; her fears have been realized, he wrote, as her apprehension...with regard to the possibility of [him] having enlisted in the civil war became a certainty. Although he characterized his environment as frenzied and poised for battle, Watson maintained that he and his compatriots [had] not yet quite despaired of a peaceable settlement of the difficulties by the Yankees becoming aware that they [had] nothing on earth to make by attacking us. What is more, the young soldier wrote that the news around the camp indicated that there would be no more Union attempts to reinforce the garrison at Fort Sumter. These efforts to resupply and strengthen the northern presence in Charleston were repeatedly rebuffed by Confederate troops throughout the winter of 1860 and 1861. Lastly, and perhaps most telling of the optimistic mindset of men like David Watson, he expressed his desire to settle up his accounts with his creditors at home. Perceiving the conflict to be only temporary, Watson spoke of account balances and petty debts as if he would be home within the next few weeks to reconcile them personally. ","Before the Battle of Fort Sumter, the event that inextricably defined what were the North and South, men like David Watson held out hope that the conflict would be short-lived. In writing to his mother, Watson expressed his belief that neither side had much to gain from a long, protracted war. His priorities lay at home in Louisa County with his family and his financial wellbeing, evidenced by his anxious desire to balance his accounts and return to his habit of keeping up daily interactions with his business associates.

Branner discussed the results of the presidential election of 1860. This election of 1860 demonstrated the adherence of the majority of Orange County, Virginia residents to the Union. Although the elections of 1860 were considered by many to be the beginning of the American Civil War, the processes and tensions regarding abolitionism, economic disparity of the North and South, and the balance of power between the federal and state governments had been brewing for decades. The polar extremes of these competing ideologies seemed to exist in the remote, distanced areas of the two regions while states like Virginia occupied the occupied the precarious border zone. In central Virginia, mixed sentiment pervaded the collective conscience of citizens like those of Orange County, a feature of the population best expressed in their voting patterns. ","427 people voted for Bell and Everett, candidates on the Union ticket. On the States' Rights ticket, 475 Orange County residents voted for Breckenridge and Lane. Also running under the Union banner, Douglas and Johnson received 12 votes, while Lincoln and Hamlin accrued zero. In sum, there were a total of 914 votes, resulting in a States' Rights majority of only 48. Evidently, citizens of Virginia were not so deeply entrenched in a Southern ideology in the early stages of the war and in fact remained mostly committed to the notion of solidarity within the Union.","After Lincoln was elected in 1860, several southern states seceded from the Union, following the example of the first to do so, South Carolina. The secessionists of Orange County were emboldened by these unprecedented maneuvers; according to W.W. Scott in his <em>History of Orange County</em>, Rosettes of blue ribbon, called 'cockades,' appeared everywhere, even at the churches. These decorative adornments symbolized the dedication to the principles of states' rights that came to define the Confederacy in the years to come. Like Branner, whose stance on the Virginia elections was relatively objective and reasoned, the citizens of Orange County were once nearly divided on antebellum political issues yet took the side of the South as neighboring states seceded from the Union, highlights effects of the hysteria-inducing frenzy drummed up through the manipulative forces (politically funded newspapers, for instance) that polarized opinions and heightened the dichotomous distinctions between North and South."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":14129,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3630,"title":"African American Voters Assaulted for Registering to Vote\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-03-28","end_date":"1896-03-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The African American voters of St. Landry parish were unable to vote. However, this inability to vote was not because it was illegal for African Americans to do so. Three hundred armed white men were standing in front of the registry office in the town of Palmetto in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana to prevent them from registering to vote. After the armed men left, a few African Americans had managed to register to vote and were therefore flogged unmercifully for their actions. Following this beating, the group of angry white men went to the home of another black man, Reuben Stelly. After requesting that he come outside to talk with them, Stelly became frightened and shot into the mob, killing a nineteen-year-old white man. In response, the armed mob fired back into the house, killing Stelly and another black man that was with him."," Though African Americans had been given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment nearly 30 years earlier in 1870, white men of the south were still trying to take a stance against this decision. This incident occurred in 1896; just one year after the grandfather clause had been enacted by several of the Southern states in the United States. A grandfather clause is a phrase used when an exemption is put in place that allows an old rule to apply to particular circumstances, while a new rule applies to everything else. This particular grandfather clause was put into place in lieu of the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local laws in the South between 1876 and 1964 that required racial segregation of African Americans in the majority of public areas. The clause stated that those who had the right to vote before 1867 would be exempt from any property, tax, or educational requirements for voting, and their descendents would have the same exemption. Because African Americans had not been given the right to vote until 1870, the clause effectively excluded blacks from voting. However, it still guaranteed the right to vote to many illiterate and poor white men. As a result of this clause, any African American attempting to register to vote would face quite an ordeal. The type of situation that Reuben Stelly was involved in was obviously chaotic, with racism motivating irrational actions. It was very common for groups of white men to gather in this way to protest the voting rights of black men. When violence erupted from these types of circumstances, it was typical for them to result in an unjust case that was unfairly represented on the part of the black man. Clearly, Reuben Stelly acted drastically because he knew what the situation entailed. The mob of white men did not just want to talk to him; he had registered to vote - exactly what they didn't want him to do. Unfortunately, this situation resulted in casualties on both sides.

This decision was unfortunate for the fashion industry, as purses, reticules, traveling bags, and footwear were all accessories that could be made out of alligator hide. Apparently, it was fashion's mandate to do so. In Louisiana and Florida, their abundance of alligators added an extra boom in their economy and helped support this fashion craze. However, alligators preyed on muskrats who would eat the crops in the area. The decline of the alligator population led to an increase in the population of muskrats, thus seriously damaging the crops. The Police Jury was so serious about this prohibition that they would fine anyone killing an alligator a penalty of 25 and put them in prison for a month for each offense. Clearly, the ban on killing alligators was not an example of animal rights activism. The banning in Plaquemines was economically and financially motivated.","While this instance could be deemed an early example of animal rights protection, it is much more likely that it is a case of Louisiana protecting its economy. Without their crops, Louisiana, much like many other states of the South, had nothing. Later in the nineteenth century, prices of farm products were consistently low. Poverty was widespread throughout Louisiana's farming population already, and without the alligators there to prey on the muskrats, their crops and income were being hurt even more. Farmers' Alliances were formed to help combat these financial issues. However, at this time, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and they essentially stood for white power, while the Farmers' Alliances consisted of mostly black farmers. During 1890, the People's Party was beginning to form, which was supported mainly by farmers in the South. It was similar to the Greenback Labor Party which had formed during the 1880s and opened the door to the concept of populism, which is the appeal to the common person and, likewise, incorporates a sense of working class activism. The Police Jury's response to the alligator situation was in direct correlation with the ideals of the People's Party and populism. The area was much more densely populated with poor farmers, struggling to make enough money to live, than rich people, who would be deeply upset by the absence of alligator purses. Only the wealthier half of the population in the state and the country could afford luxuries such as those. Therefore, the mandate to forbid killing alligators was both necessary and logical. Crops bring in much more money to the states economy than the alligator fashion trend, so sacrificing that fad makes much more sense for the sake of the states' financial well-being."],"display_date":"April 26, 1890","search_date":"1890-04-26","locations":[{"id":5620,"lat":29.1168615299,"lng":-89.3283829847,"zoom":8,"place":"PLAQUEMINES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3637,"title":"A Mayor Improves Baton Rouge\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the summer of 1899, Robert A. Hart, the mayor of the city of Baton Rouge in Louisiana, along with a small band of progressive citizens persuaded local property owners to approve a sequence of bond issues in order to improve the area. One of the issues cost 200,000 and paid for a new city hall, a new school, and paving of certain roads. Other issues went towards making new schools and hospitals and improving drainage systems. Hart's ability to cajole property owners into approving these bonds is commendable because the citizens of the city were infamously stingy with their money, especially in taxing themselves. Part of the funds from the bonds went to pay for a black public school, as well, which was a decision that the citizens were not aware of, and were not happy with. While African American children had been attending a segregated school in the area, they had never received an improvement, and the white people of Baton Rouge did not want them to have one.","Racial segregation in schools and other public systems was customary throughout the United States during the nineteenth century. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 involving the segregation of railroad passengers, racial segregation was deemed constitutional as long as the facilities were separate but equal. The Supreme Court did not acknowledge the fact that most of the facilities in the country that were segregated were not actually equal. However, one of the Supreme Court justices, Justice John Marshall Harlan, favored the rights of African Americans as guaranteed. Harlan protested that the separate but equal decision was an expression of white supremacy, would stimulate aggression and hatred between the races, and would perpetuate a feeling of distrust. Schools weren't the only areas being segregated; hotels, toilets, parks, bars, schools, hospitals, even telephone booths, and separate sections in libraries, restaurants, and move theaters were being segregated, as well, the latter often with separate ticket windows and counters. There were also laws prohibiting inter-racial sex and marriage, which is known as miscegenation. African American schools were required to have African American teachers and administrators, while white schools were required to have white teachers and administrators. White citizens would naturally be enraged if they found out that a black school was getting an improvement that their school was not receiving. However, schools for African American children rarely saw improvements, much less through a bond issued by the mayor. Hart's improvement, therefore, was unique in the South and revolutionary in the changes that it suggested.

Morton was lying in port. A fight occurred between some of the sailors, and one man was severely injured while another was killed. Charles Furlong, one of the men who intervened in the quarrel in an attempt to stop the men from fighting, was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment and was sent to the Baton Rouge Penitentiary Center on July 15, 1885. Orders were later issued to send a fleet of the convicts to Shreveport, Louisiana, where they would be working in the swamp and raising the road bed above the high-water mark. Furlong had heard of the cruelties that many inmates suffered through when they were taken on jobs like this. On the way to Shreveport, he jumped off of the boat that was transporting him in an effort to commit suicide. Multiple shots were fired at him, but he swam away and was not injured. Several days later, the coroner of Ascension Parish, Louisiana found a body of a man floating in the river and it was identified as Furlong.","Suicide seemed like a much more appealing option than the brutality faced by inmates during their imprisonment for many convicts during the nineteenth century in the South. Charles Furlong was, therefore, one of many men who decided he would rather kill himself than go through the torture of being in the Louisiana Penitentiary System. Though slavery had been abolished in the thirteenth amendment in 1865, being forced to do work on roads, railways, plantations, and buildings was similar to being brought back to pre-abolitionist society. Men were whipped and beaten on a regular basis; much like a slave would be, if they did not do their assigned work correctly. The tales of brutality that existed at the camps were shocking and almost beyond belief. There was even a law that paralyzed the tongue of the convict, forbidding him to speak of what had happened to him at the convict labor camps. Convict labor was so important that if a slave attempted to escape or kill himself, much like Furlong did, guards were ordered to shoot and kill them in their tracks. Major General Winfield Scott Hancock was currently in command of the military department in Louisiana and had issued an order for the employment of convicts outside of the prison walls. There also was ample military necessary for the General's actions. A state law was currently in place that actually stated a prohibition of convicts working outside of the penitentiary walls. However, state laws concerning prisoner's rights were then of little account, and prison management had drifted into the wrong hands - the hands of the military. They used the convicts at their disposal and for their own profit. While the control of the Louisiana State Penitentiary lying in the hand of the military was unusual, prisoners committing suicide to escape the brutal work at convict labor camps was not, and Charles Furlong's story is one of many."],"display_date":"July 15, 1885","search_date":"1885-07-15","locations":[{"id":5772,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"WEST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3640,"title":"African American Vote Eliminated in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"10/19/00","end_date":"10/19/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In October of 1900 the African Americans of Louisiana did not vote. The newly implemented Poll Tax Qualifications eliminated their ability to do so. The total amount of white men that registered to vote was 102,723 against only 1,147 registered African American men. What was true of the state as a whole was equally true of individual parishes, as well. Fifteen parishes reported less than ten African Americans were able to register to vote. There was even only a single black man registered in the parish of St. Charles. The poll tax cut down the African American vote by roughly 130,000 men. Only about 35,000 whites had allowed themselves to be disenfranchised by the poll tax laws either because they do not value the ballot, or because of neglect or carelessness.","The voting situation in Louisiana in October of 1900 was not unique to this state alone. The Poll Tax Qualifications required each person registering to vote to pay a tax for their vote. The origin of the implementation of the poll tax rests in the development of the Populist Party of the 1880s and 1890s in the Southern United States. The Populist Party demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of the railroads, a tariff for revenue only, the direct election of U.S. senators, and other measures designed to strengthen political democracy and give farmers economic parity with business and industry. The Populists in the South gave the Democrats the only competition they had seen in the polls since the end of Reconstruction. The competition became so intense that both parties pushed for African Americans to be able to vote in the election so that they could have their votes. However, the Democrats won, and when the Populists were defeated the Democrats implemented various laws into their state constitutions in order to disenfranchise the African American voter. After payment of a poll tax was made a pre-requisite to voting, very few blacks had enough money to pay for it, along with impoverished white citizens, thus eliminating their ability to register to vote. This poll tax lived on for several decades, until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964 declared poll taxes unconstitutional in all states. The large disparity between black voters and white voters in Louisiana, therefore, was common to southern states in 1900 because of the disabling poll tax."],"display_date":"October 19, 1900","search_date":"1900-10-19","locations":[{"id":5666,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3643,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-07-17","end_date":"1830-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":"July 17, 1830","search_date":"1830-07-17","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3650,"title":"A Request from the American Colonization Society \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-07-07","end_date":"1820-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 7, 1820, the American Colonization Society took out an advertisement in the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em>. The ad, which was actually more of an announcement, concerned the need for equipment, tools, food, and other supplies by the colonists whom the Society sponsored. These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3666,"title":"The Virginia Census of 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The composition and make-up of Virginia was complicated and had changed since the last census, so the editors of the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>, Norman Miller and George A. Porterfield, published the 1850 census of Virginia in March 1851. It showed the free white, free colored, slave, and total population in each county of the Commonwealth Virginia. As the census broke down the Virginia population into the Trans-Alleghany, Valley, Piedmont, and Tidewater regions, the people of western Virginia who read the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em> rejoiced in their growth.","One thing is clear for the region: whites always outnumbered the combined number of free blacks and slaves. Other than that, the Appalachian region was varied in its proportions. Kanawha County had the largest slave population (3,140) in the region with black people, including free and slave, making up 22 percent of its population, while whites made up 78 percent. This was a county with one of the largest disparities between free and enslaved. Pulaski was 71 percent white with 29 percent black. Likewise, Greenbrier, Washington, Montgomery, and Wythe had large black proportions with 15 percent to 20 percent black. In contrast, Barbour County's free black population (214) outnumbered its slave population (113), and the county had a substantial number of whites (8,682), having 96 percent white population. Scott, Wood, Lee, and Brooke Counties also shared a large white population ranging from 92 percent to 97 percent. Most common, however, were counties where the free black population stayed in the low double-digits, while the slave population was substantial, such as in Pulaski county, where there were 3,612 whites, 32 free blacks, and 1,470 slaves. In counties like Pulaski, the large proportion of slaves showed interesting developments in the social climate.","The white population in the mountain region was the highest in the state, surpassing the tidewater, piedmont, and valley regions with 331,568 total whites. The proportion of whites in the Trans-Alleghany region was 92 percent, which contrasts sharply with the proportion of total whites in the entire state, which was 63 percent. Meanwhile, the black population in the Trans-Alleghany region for both the free black population and the slave population was the lowest compared to other areas in Virginia, being 2,482 and 24,436, respectively. ","Slavery had already been prevalent in the Appalachian South, but in 1820, there were large slave concentrations in Kanawha and Greenbrier counties in western Virginia. Over the following 30 years, as these slave communities grew, other places in Appalachia remained void of slavery, such as Jackson County, Kentucky. There was no denying slavery's impact on Appalachia. There were regular slave markets including one in Bristol, Virginia, where slaves could be sold down river if necessary. At the same time that slavery was expanding, antislavery followers moved into Appalachia. In 1827, 106 of the 130 antislavery societies in the nation were located in the South, with a heavy concentration in the Appalachian Mountains. What the Census of 1850 showed was that Appalachia was made up of varied counties. Appalachia had counties where there was a large number of slaves and free blacks, and at the same time, it had counties where there was virtually no black population. Regardless of individual county analysis, Appalachia on the general scale was white. The white population seemed to be concentrated in the Trans-Alleghany Valley, as the white population for that region was 92 percent while the proportion of whites throughout the whole state was 63 percent. Since the Trans-Alleghany Valley contained only 25 percent of the total population in Virginia, it seemed like white Virginians concentrated in Appalachia. This could possibly have been due to the antislavery movement, although it is more likely that the movement was for pursuing land and religious culture in Appalachia."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":14654,"lat":38.3892987778,"lng":-81.5023034378,"zoom":8,"place":"KANAWHA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3671,"title":"Reconstruction and the Ku Klux Klan \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-02-12","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Hamilton W.

His intentions were motivated by a humanitarian desire to assist the freedmen adjust to their new lives. His efforts at ensuring the enfranchisement of blacks did not go unnoticed, however. On February 12, 1869, a letter was waiting for Pierson when he arrived at his home. Adorned with a skull and cross bones at the top, it addressed him as Sir. Pierson was called a vagrant carpet-bagger and a scoundrel of the deepest dye for maliciously interfering in the political realm of the town. The threatening letter was from the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan warned him to stop his efforts at enfranchising blacks and leave the region immediately.

In 1870, Congress passed the Force Acts to help end the violence and enforce the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the Constitution.","The KKK was a secret society created during the Reconstruction era to intimidate blacks and white reformers. The white-supremacist group employed terrorizing methods towards individuals usually associated with the Republican Party. Northerners were often associated with the Republican Party by southerners. This elucidates the connection between Northerners and the term carpetbaggers. The term carpetbagger was used as a derogatory reference for northern whites who moved to the southern states during Reconstruction. They were often viewed as exploiters who were taking advantage of the economic, social, and political conditions of southern society for their own personal gain. Members of the KKK blamed the Republicans for overturning their social order and imposing restrictions on southern whites who had supported the Confederate war effort. They burned black-owned buildings, and terrorized and killed freedmen who tried to exercise their right to vote in elections. Unfortunately, their efforts were usually successful.

Zephaniah Turner raised this question repeatedly before the House of Delegates in Richmond. In the eyes of Turner, West Virginians were just as responsible for payment as Virginians, seeing as how the debt had existed before dismemberment of the state. Turner blasted Virginia's political representatives for rattling on about preserving honor when their priority should have been to prevent burdening the state's citizens with enormous taxes. When the people discover the unjust tax plans, Turner exclaimed, they would run out the current leaders and elevate to their places others who have less sublimated ideas of honor and fame and the past, and more practical ones as to the present and future."," In the aftermath of the Civil War, Virginia faced a significant economic hurdle-- a public debt of approximately 45 million. Although the debt, initially used to fund transportation initiatives like railroads and canals, started out as 33 million prior to war, the amount had swelled to its present state. Debates ensued over how to pay this sum. Since the westernmost counties of Virginia had only established the new state of West Virginia in 1863, some, like Turner, argued that the debt belonged to West Virginia as well and thus Virginians were not legally bound to pay anything. However, the main controversy of 1871 became whether Virginia should fund its entire debt plus interest or pay at a readjusted (reduced) level. This battle catalyzed the formation of two factions, the Funders and the Readjusters."," In 1871 the state government passed the Funding Act. This legislation pledged Virginia to pay the debt in full, marking the state as the only southern postwar government to fund its debt at such a high rate. As rationale, Funders pointed to the importance of saving the honor of Virginia, although additional motivation came from the fact that many were looking to profit from their state bonds. The Funders' decision eventually proved to be a strain for Virginia as it exhausted the state of its revenues and forced it to borrow just to continue operating its government. Leaders also severed funding for social services such as asylums, encouraged skyrocketing property taxes, and enforced new taxation on items such as dogs and liquor consumption. In addition, although constitutional requirements demanded the state to assume most of the cost of the new public school system, the Funders instead chose to shut down half of its schools, citing public education as a luxury.

Fredericksburg & Potomac had violated Richmond's laws, the city claimed, by running its steam- propelled cars through Broad Street. According to an ordinance passed on September 8, 1873, no vehicle of any kind was allowed to traverse that specific lane, the most important and populous street of the city. The F&P Railroad Company, on the other hand, charged that when Richmond chartered the company in 1834, the city specifically granted the company's directors the power to place whatever vehicles they deemed necessary on the railroads. The court eventually ruled in favor of Richmond, deciding that the city's inherent right to guard the safety and welfare of its citizens did not violate any contract between Richmond and the F&P Railroad Company."," In the Reconstruction-era South, railroads played a prominent role, expanding in number (mileage doubled in the years from 1865 to 1880) while functioning as a symbol for urban development and economic growth. Between 1868 and 1873, white southerners touted railroad construction as the key to revitalizing their war-torn region, and indeed, Judge Christian mentioned in his opinion that when the railroad company was founded, Broad Street was a mere turnpike, neither graded nor paved, with scattered houses on the side. By the time of the case, however, Broad Street had become a site of many retail businesses and served as a bustling tourist site. "," At the same time, railroad companies suffered their share of critics. Many felt that the railroads exploited their lack of supervision to act like institutions beyond the reach of legislatures or courts. For example, railroads often charged excessively high fees, but denounced suggestions of rate regulations as violations of private property rights. In the Richmond vs. the F&P Railroad Company case, the railroad tried to convince the judge that its charter cemented a right by contract forever, and under all circumstances, to run its cars by steam, thereby exempting the company from any form of city regulatory laws.

Northern leaders had degraded you and themselves, he criticized, by inviting the co-operation of the black race with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Confederacy and inviting them into the North's army and navy. Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics. Jackson, against the bank for ideological reasons, fought to defeat it. He removed the bank deposits, effectively killing the bank in 1834. Directly as a result of this, the Whig Party formed in opposition to Jackson. John C. Calhoun, another opponent to Jackson, favored the bank and fought against Jackson when he removed the bank deposits."],"display_date":"December 13, 1848 - December 13, 1855","search_date":"1852-06-13","locations":[{"id":11504,"lat":33.8449766897,"lng":-81.9100531274,"zoom":8,"place":"EDGEFIELD, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3689,"title":"The Spartanburg Female College\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-08-22","end_date":"1855-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a hot sunny date in the upcountry of South Carolina, S.

He carefully described the faculty, which included a minister, and the courses of study, ranging from reading and writing to arithmetic and geography. He pleaded with the audience to understand the importance of female education in Southern society. Women were expected to be good mothers, and he wanted to make each woman be a nobly-nursing wife because that is her great mission upon earth. Without proper education, he lamented, women were susceptible to corruption. Education provided the solution to maintaining a proper Southern culture. Without good mothers, he argued, future generations of children would not be raised properly. It was incumbent upon everyone to plan for the future; each one had a moral obligation. So, let your prayers unite with ours in behalf of this institution-so useful to women-so necessary to mankind-so honorable to its liberal founders. ","To maintain Southern Cultural identity, males wanted to keep women in the homes and raise the families. However, there were women who protested this simple mindset, like Louisa McCord, as cited by the historian Michael O'Brien. Women like this provided reasons to create a college like this in order to teach women how to be 'proper'. She wrote an essay in 1852 called the Enfranchisement of Women. She advocated women's rights and wrote that women were out of place, unappreciated, having their talents and powers not only hidden under a bushel, but absolutely thrown away, while she becomes either the slave or the toy of men. As was the case with this college, women learned to read and write in order to be good wives, not for their own edification. Because some women, such as McCord, protested their treatment, the need to indoctrinate women to be subservient to their husbands became necessary. For this reason, educating women in Southern culture was very important.

His statement read that not a Southern newspaper is to be seen in a large newspaper reading room in Washington D.C. Finally, the Courier insisted that Southerners must open their eyes to the truth and tyranny of the North. The way to counteract these, the paper suggested, was to stop buying Northern newspapers. Shall we continue to make Northern men wealthy in order to promote their abolition doctrines These acts menaced the institution of slavery. Southerners must rally around Southern newspapers and bear in mind that each dollar spent to help the wealthy Northerners was only helping them challenge freedoms enjoyed by the South.

William Freehling argues that South Carolinians thought they were special for representing the 'old South' and for the intellectual stature. This newspaper article matches the scholarship of Freehling and indicates the importance of how Southerners thought they were viewed in the North. They had a high sense of 'self-worth and would challenge anyone who did not agree. By not granting the Southern newspapers on the same stature as Northern newspapers, Northerners were perceived as insulting South Carolinian. ","This reflects the larger concerns over slavery. South Carolinians, even in 1849, feared the abolitionist intentions of the North. The Free Soil Party had run as a moderately successful third party in the 1848 election but was nowhere close to being popular. However, Southerners were aware of Northern abolition intentions, even if they were on a small scale and feared that any disrespectful action towards the South meant that abolition of slavery was coming.

One of the greatest political figures of the 19th century had just died and the atmosphere surrounding his death was incredible. Both Chambers were crowded to overflowing, and the stillness that pervaded the vast assemblage told plainly that some great calamity had happened to the country. Calhoun, born in Abbeville in 1782, had served the state of South Carolina on a national level for many years. The entire front page of the Courier devoted its coverage to his death. Senator Butler, in his remarks about the death of Calhoun, called him one of the nation's great gentlemen, who treated everyone with justice and fairness. Butler further emphasized Calhoun's love of the nation, his devotion of service to the institutions of the country. As head of the Senate, he presided over the chamber with dignity and with efficiency and with a true devotion of service to the country. The following day's coverage further demonstrated the deep love and admiration of Calhoun. His body was brought into the Congressional chamber for a viewing which was filled with the President, Vice President and many officers of the army and navy. As Butler noted, one of the brightest luminaries has been extinguished from the political firmament. ","The death of Calhoun marked the end of one of the great compromisers of the ante-bellum South. Even though he did not see live to see the Compromise of 1850, he played an instrumental role in the compromise. He did propose ending slavery in the District of Columbia because he feared the potential consequences of maintaining it there. ","Furthermore, William Freehling discusses Calhoun's role within South Carolina. South Carolina viewed him as a hero, someone to be proud of. He was their senator and the vice president and played a critical role in the nullification crisis during the 1830's. The Courier's tribute to his life demonstrated the deep affections local communities had for Calhoun, and Freehling concurs with the newspaper in describing how important Calhoun was to South Carolina. Even though Calhoun had been a defender of slaveholders' rights, he still agreed to compromise. But he only wanted to compromise to a certain degree. Calhoun was a champion of state's rights and this attitude would later contribute to the secession crisis in 1860. The nullification crisis demonstrated Calhoun's belief in the fundamental sovereignty of South Carolina which would be used to justify secession from the union ten years after his death. After his death, the old guard of Clay and Calhoun gave way to a new generation which would have to deal with new compromises and new challenges and new threats to break up the union.

The bill, classified as unfair to the Southern cause by the Keowee Courier, was protested by Southern senators in particular Senator Badger. The Courier reflected on the prudence of how to protect Southern rights within the senate proceedings. Concerns were expressed regarding what the future would hold in store if California were admitted in the Union as a free state. The great discussion involved several senators, Badger, Downs and Pratt, and whether or not they should enter a formal protest into the bill. Debates continued in the House of Representatives and involved whether or not to establish a territorial government for Utah. Nevertheless, the Bill passed the Senate with Senator Pratt of Maryland voting against the bill and Senators Downs and Badger abstained from voting on the bill. ","The compromise of 1850 had a tremendous effect on the country. Both Northern and Southern loyalists felt the compromise weakened their positions. As argued in the book, The Civil War and Reconstruction, Henry Clay, usually given credit for enabling a compromise, did play a pivotal role, but he did not lay out all of the terms of a compromise. Clay's dramatic Senate speech early on in the year summed up his life as a politician and continued the approach that slavery was bad and evil but did little to actually bring it to an end. Calhoun, before his death, gave a speech in the Senate saying how the union had lost its old republic sense that the hostility towards the South and slavery had to be stopped or else secession could be justified.

The project was being headed up by four commissioners who would be in charge of deciding who will complete the project.

The turnpike in South Carolina required funding from the state and Whig support. ","As the Whigs continued to build support, projects such as this became more popular and feasible. As the decades continued to pass, railroad construction became a more important issue and encouraged the debate of how to allocate state funds.

Edgar's evidence emphasizes the role played by infrastructure and transportation within South Carolina. ","This narrative reflects the growth of statewide infrastructure and corresponds to the national debates of the proper role of government in the economy.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3701,"title":"Gold deposits within Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-05","end_date":"1859-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gold What could be more illustrious to read about during the mid nineteenth century than gold? On March 9, 1859, the Farmer's Cabinet published an article briefly summarizing one man's visit to the sub-treasury gold reserve in Washington, D.C. In a seemingly obvious attempt to bolster national comfort and ease economic pessimist, the lure of gold and more importantly a surplus of gold available in the sub-treasury gave the reader the feeling that though times seemed bleak, there was enough gold in this town to support half the world for life. The Panic of 1857 was a sudden downturn in the economy caused by, among other things, the decision of British investors to remove funds from U.S. banks for fear of economic instability. Beginning in 1848, the California Gold Rush ushered in millions of dollars in gold to many different treasury deposits such as the one located in the city of Washington. Many news outlets following the Panic chose to run stories such as this one to bring about a feeling of national economic security that would ease investors.The author described the sight of a piece of golden cheese worth nearly a quarter of a million U.S. dollars. As the Gold Rush progressed and the rich got richer, local banks and gold dealers issued banknotes in exchange for gold, private mints created private gold coins, and gold was sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the thriving California financial system.   Herbert Brayer even went as far as to say that overnight California became the Mecca of America, shipping assets and wealth domestically as well as across the globe. The ramifications of the discovery of gold in California were incredible: towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives were sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.The brightest light shed from the account is that which is seen at the Sub-Treasury in Washington where the author describes the everything-proof bunker, which is filled on all sides with Solid Bars of gold and silver.

These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time. Though many of the penny press' so called prospectuses did shed some insight on the future to come, they also had an ambivalent side with predictions so vague that they easily could have some aspects of truth. On the other hand, Bailey's assertions of the changing nature of society proved to be more believable and valid than Bellamy's work."],"display_date":"December 13, 1849","search_date":"1849-12-13","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3704,"title":"The Changing Nature of the Institution of Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-03-12","end_date":"1857-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted? The author of the article would obviously agree with Johnson's assessment of Northup's dilemma: in a world where one man can own another man and have this action protected by the rights of property, who can be trusted?"],"display_date":"March 12, 1857","search_date":"1857-03-12","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3705,"title":"Washington Journalists\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-01-01","end_date":"1855-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With political and social temperatures running high in the winter of 1855, many journalists turned to debates concerning the acquisition of new lands, but this time outside of the modern day contiguous United States. Many rumors circulated about secret deals with foreign countries in exchange for economic and Republican support. One particular rumor published in an article from the Farmer's Cabinet concerned the possibility of a United States acquisition of all Nicaraguan lands in exchange for help establishing a firm and stable government. The authors pre-disposition against the British was quite apparent as the author went so far as to blame them for creating a treaty with Nicaragua to debunk the United States' plans for expansion into Latin America. This geopolitical chess game is not an unfamiliar scene in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were many occasions when it was rumored that Washington had already worked out plans with a foreign nation only to discover later that such a possibility could never exist. Only a few weeks after this article was published, the Panama Railway opened, becoming the first railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The influence of articles like the one from the Farmer's Cabinet helped to keep Washington in check. Furthermore, without discussion of the possibilities of expanding the national boundaries, it would be nearly impossible for a democratic government to get enough sources of information to make a clear and rational decision on the proper course of action. One cannot ignore the fact that at this time there was no guarantee of journalistic integrity.

He expressed his disgust for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and its architect, Nicholas Trist. This letter comes near the end of Webster's career, and the letter revealed that fatigue from a long career in politics had begun to set in. Though he was clearly disgusted over imperialist actions taken by the United States in the West, which upset the delicate balance between free and slave states, his will and conviction appeared to be weakening.Merely six days later, the Senate ratified the treaty and America gained five hundred twenty-five thousand square miles of territory at a net cost of just under twenty million U.S. dollars. Daniel Webster had every right to be skeptical of the suspicious circumstances that surrounded the acquisition of the formerly Mexican lands. Trist negotiated the treaty without President Polk's prior consent, but Polk later agreed to the treaty and sent it to Congress to be ratified. Finally, in May of 1848, Mexican officials agreed to the terms, and the war was officially over. Richard Winders, a historian and former Curator for the Alamo, even went as far as to make the point that the United States' War with Mexico doomed the two great parties of the era by forcing their associates to take sides on the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories and indirectly on the future of the institution of slavery itself. In hindsight, Webster's fear of instability stemming from the new lands was correct, but at the time, the majority of Congress disagreed and Webster settled for peace, despite his unwavering certainty that it would be short lived.

Virginia had just succeeded and the loyalty of the yard was torn between North and South. Both sides wanted it and sent forces to take control of it. The first ones to get there were two companies of Virginia Navy volunteers and militiamen of the Norfolk Greys who mustered outside the gates. They hoped to persuade Commodore McAuley, the man in charge, to give control up to the Confederates. McAuley had already planned on holding out at the yard until the Union arrived to take it over, which he thought would be soon. This put him in a serious predicament: he could try and hold out and risk losing the yard to the confederates, or he could burn the yard to the ground and sink all of its ships so the confederates couldn't use anything at the yard. McAuley chose the latter, he burnt the whole yard and sank all of the ships. As all of this ruckus was going on, the help that McAuley was waiting on arrived. The USS Pawnee arrived from the Potomac River, and the Union soldiers finished setting fire to the yard and blew up the dry dock to put it out of use. The Pawnee then headed back north leaving the Gosport Naval Yard in ruins. They also left the Confederates with many heavy guns, gun powder, and the sunken USS Merrimack."," This event contains the fight between the North and the South for the possession of seats of power. In the case of Gosport it was a heavily armed naval yard. Even though it was in Virginia, which succeeded, the Union claimed much of the weapons contained in the yard. This event shows the hostility that existed between the North and South even at the beginning of the war, and how people were pressured to quickly side with one or the other, like in McAuley's case.

The Southern landscape was ruined and the memory was still fresh in the former Confederates minds. Stories of continued southern defiance toward Yankees and violence against freedmen were common. The Radical Republicans called for extreme measures to punish the South for its actions. However, the Northern Moderates wanted to punish the South but also wanted them back in the Union as fast as possible. The fear of increased violence concerned the Moderates. The paper's response also foreshadowed a long road to true equality for the former slaves.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3782,"title":"Woman Suffrage Summarily Disposed of in MissouriWoman Suffrage Summarily Disposed of in Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-02-17","end_date":"1871-02-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Missouri Congressional session of 1871, women suffragists from across the ","state drafted a proposal which was given to the State Senate Committee.

Former state senator Thomas GrimkÉ felt this action was completely uncalled for. Although likely in the minority of his peers, he was not alone in this belief. GrimkÉ believed that nullification, far more than being an overreaction to the tariffs, was a step taken against the Republic.

He felt that if the state were allowed to ignore any law put in place by the National government, then the entire Union was threatened.

In April 1862, the Senate Committee on the Conduct of War was asked to investigate accusations of Confederate crimes against Union dead and wounded at the First Battle of Manassas.  On May 5, 1862, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> published the Committee's report, including excerpts of testimony and their conclusions.  The testimony was taken from soldiers and citizens who witnessed or were victims of the atrocities.  The testimony of Drs. Swain and Ferguson both highlighted instances in which wounded Union soldiers were denied adequate medical care, leading to further pain and death in some cases.  Louis Francis, a Union soldier, gave testimony as a victim of this inadequate treatment; his wounds were so badly tended that on several occasions the bone of his amputated leg continued to rupture through his wound.  His multiple requests for a more qualified surgeon were all denied.    Finally, the Committee heard testimony from many citizens who had witnessed Confederate soldiers desecrating the bodies of the Union dead in order to obtain trophies, such as bones or skulls.  All of the testimony and evidence led the Committee to find that Confederate soldiers had committed atrocities against the Union's wounded and deceased.  In their conclusion, the committee decried the barbarism of the Confederacy and called for the support of all loyal people and foreign nations to defeat this inhumane and immoral enemy of the Republic.  ","The First Battle of Manassas was an embarrassing defeat for the North; it weighed down their spirit of prewar triumphalism, deflated the morale of the troops, and quelled public support for the Civil War.  Historian Harry Stout claims that many religious and civilian leaders viewed the defeat as a moral judgment against the North's leaders and their aims in war.   After the defeat, the North needed to rally mass public support and boost the morale of the troops; this report and its publication were an attempt to define the North's cause as a noble fight against the barbarism of the uncivilized South.  The committee made this expressly clear in their conclusion's call for support and solidarity against the inhumane enemy.  This article framed the conflict as a war that pitted the civilized and virtuous North against the uncivilized and barbaric South; this interpretative shift helped the Union regain popular support for the War and reenergized their troops against the enemy.

On December 21, 1866, a detachment of 81 soldiers under the command of Captain William Fetterman was lured out of Fort Phil Kearny, ambushed by a coalition of Indians, and completely destroyed. News of the nation's worst military defeat on the frontier traveled slowly. A massive blizzard blanketed the West and traveled eastward, preventing America from learning the fate of the 81 soldiers until nearly two weeks after their deaths. When newspapers finally received word from their frontier correspondents, a horrified nation was stunned by news of an Indian attack like no other to date.","\"Massacre\" screamed the headlines as Americans tried to piece together what had happened. The initial shock was accompanied by a desire for revenge against the Indians. \"Slaughter,\" \"massacre,\" and \"butchery\" were the words used to describe the battle. It was determined that \"We must now have a war of extermination.\" Blame for the debacle quickly settled on the government and the Army: Americans questioned Indian policy and demanded that the military, rather than the Interior Department bureaucracy deal with the hostile Sioux along the Bozeman Trail. \"The fact is that Indian affairs here have been horribly bungled,\" argued the journalist from the frontier.","The Army sought to divert blame in a drama that involved Civil War generals Grant and Sherman. Fort Kearny's commander and Fetterman's superior, Colonel Carrington became the immediate scapegoat. Carrington was accused of everything from cowardice to incompetence as the War Department sought to paint the fiasco as problem of local, rather than national, command. Courts of inquiry convened and official investigations, both by the Army, and eventually Congress, lead to conflicting testimony. Rather than conducting \"a war of extermination,\" the Army quietly settled affairs the following year by signing a treaty with Red Cloud, the Indian leader responsible for planning the attack on Fetterman.","But ultimately, Fetterman himself would take the blame for the \"Fetterman Massacre.\" Popular history describes him as an arrogant, foolhardy officer whose underestimation of Indians led to not only his own demise, but, excepting only Custer's Last Stand, the worst Indian-related disaster on the Plains in American history."],"display_date":"December 21, 1866","search_date":"1866-12-21","locations":[{"id":15204,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DATOKA TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3882,"title":"Furman University&#39;s Philosophian Society Discusses Divisive Issues\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-22","end_date":"1861-04-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 22, 1861 in Philosophian Hall at Furman  University, a secretive meeting was called to order.  A leather-bound book as tall as a man's forearm with robin's egg blue pages was then opened reverently, and a man's voice read aloud the last meeting's minutes.  After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

In <em>The Mariner's Chronicle</em>, one gentleman on board described the scene in the boiler room as a \"complete wreck - a picture of destruction\".  He witnessed one man with \"the whole of the forehead blown away: the brains were still beating.  Tufts of hair, shreds of clothing, and splotches of blood might be seen in every direction\".  Outside the boiler room \"on every side were to be heard groans and mingled exclamations of grief and despair\" as men and women dealt with the injured.  One man's face \"was entirely black; his body without a particle of skin.  He had been flayed alive\".  To witness such horrors - fellow passengers in pain, near death, and begging for death to \"free them from present suffering\" - devastated the survivors.  The gentleman judged that between forty and fifty people perished either instantly, from injury, from inhaling steam or gas, or from drowning.  "," No doubt people faced danger when traveling during the 19th century.   John Burke in \"Bursting Boilers and Federal Power\" stated that between 1816 and 1848 about 233 steamboat explosions occurred.  The lack of regulation on the boilers at that time contributed to most of the accidents.  Steamboat explosions caused the loss of goods affecting the economy as well as the loss of lives affecting each individual and each family.  Ultimately, the loss of lives and goods played a crucial role in affecting American history.  The number of lives lost compelled American legislation to question how steamboats could become safer and whether federal power had the right to create regulatory agencies.    ","In 1824, the <em>Gibbons v Ogden</em> ruling handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that \"the power to regulate commerce, so far as it extends, is exclusively vested in Congress\" allowing Congress to regulate private business and to interfere where government had never interfered before.  As more steamboat explosions killed more lives, the American people reacted.  In 1830, Secretary of Treasury Samuel D. Ingham gave money to The Franklin Institute to experiment and inspect steam engine boilers.  The combination of the number of deaths due to explosions and the data from the experiments forced the Steamboat Act of 1838 to become law.  The Steamboat Act of 1852 established the Steamboat Inspection Service, one of the first federal agency to regulate private industry, allowing the Act of 1838 to be enforced by a government agency.  Aside from safer traveling, the impact of this legislation still affects Americans.

It was here, in Columbia, that the federal court attempted to provide serious solutions to stunt the organization whose actions had become increasingly violent and oppressive. While these actions by the federal court and the infamous nature of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina created controversial issues in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the \"reign of terror\" by the Ku Klux Klan was temporarily immobilized by token arrests in 1871. ","The Ku Klux Klan planted their roots, under emissary R.J. Brunson in 1868 in Rock Hill, S.C. The Democrats, hoping to win back governmental positions in South Carolina, felt that by intimidating and eliminating the \"negro Republican vote,\" victory could once again belong to the Democratic Party. In Abbeville County, for instance, the secretive, violent actions of the Democratic Party went hand in hand with the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, working together in most cases. In the presidential election year, South Carolina was anticipated to have won steadily Republican seats, but instead, intimidation triumphed democracy.","The violence exploded in the elections of 1868, as Abbeville, Newberry and Anderson counties were entitled \"the KKK counties\" because of the armed mobs and murders that occurred on Election Day as white supremacists employed violence to ensure political upheaval. One Southern man claimed that they [white Southern Democrats] were being \"trodden under foot by an inferior and barbarous race.\" But by 1870, the Democrats could no longer depend on intimidation to win elections and the emergence of the more militant KKK continually gained momentum, primarily for Democratic Party political gains, and of course, in the name of white supremacy. When 2,500 armed whites gathered in Laurens County to violently protest the election results in 1870, violence spread among the upstate of South Carolina. Negroes were pulled out of jail, beaten and murdered by white supremacy members of the KKK. In York County alone, in the course of six months, there was an estimated 304 incidents of violence. Klan violence, though the Klan had been officially disbanded in 1969, arose out of all socio-economical classes in a decentralized format, reigning terror and death wherever possible. The federal government, under Grant in late 1870 and early 1871, respectively passed the Enforcement Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act hoping to put an end to the once again rebellious South through these increasingly strict federal acts. Because of these acts, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in nine South Carolina counties and in most cases, the procedure of due process was neglected.","The trials, evidenced by Evans Murphy's questioning during one aspect of the ongoing South Carolina trials, proved mostly ineffective and as support waned, largely futile. In the South Carolina KKK trials alone, an account collaborated by the federal government in 1873 discovered that 831 persons were indicted and only 27 of which were ruled guilty, 71 persons pled guilty, and by 1875 pardons released the last of the imprisoned KKK members and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was passed in early March. Under the Klan's \"virtual reign of terror,\" however, much violence and terror was accomplished. But those who were caught and testified in court, such as Evans Murphy, created an environment not easily conducive to convictions. Evans claimed \"[he] didn't see anything [himself], [he] didn't do anything [himself],\" and \"[he] didn't hear anything\" about the night he was said to have been one of nine members in a beating at the Rainey house. Yet, as the questioner so succinctly stated, \"so it turns out that those who happen to be indicted didn't do anything, and all those that haven't been caught, did the whipping.\"  And with that testimony, Evans Murphy, like the other token Klan members convicted, was fined one hundred dollars and imprisoned for eighteen months, in order for South Carolina to put an end to Klan violence and grant South Carolina peace. The story of Evans Murphy provides insight into the South Carolina Ku Klux Klan trials, which temporarily shattered the Ku Klux Klan and reinstated temporary law and order, only to have the organization emerge once again in the 1920s, more violent than ever."],"display_date":"December 28, 1871 - March 1, 1875","search_date":"1873-07-29","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3900,"title":"Southern Wartime Humor Concerning President Lincoln\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-07","end_date":"1863-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1863 the Raleigh Register published a song by Smith Webb mocking President Lincoln and his ability to keep the Union together.

The humor appealed to all classes and united them during their time of struggle. Many of the humorous writings focused on patriotism. Often the writings urged citizens to fight in the war or support their nation and the war effort with more enthusiasm.  Humor was also used as an outlet to express discontent with the war and the political situations occurring during the time. ","The Confederate newspapers constantly published wartime humor mocking Lincoln and portraying him in extreme fashions.  Lincoln was the embodiment of the South's anger with the war and the current state of affairs.  His trouble with secession was a constant subject of mockery from the southern newspapers.  One cartoon depicted Lincoln as an acrobat balancing the North on one side of his pole while dropping the South to the floor below.  Another cartoon depicted Lincoln as a circus performer about to do a balancing act with the northern and the southern states as plates on sticks balancing in the air.  Lincoln was subject of a variety of wartime humor published in the South, but all the humor published served to communicate the current political issues and opinions.

At that convention James Shannon gave an address entitled \"Domestic Slavery,\" in which he attempted to justify the practice of slavery and disprove the validity of the reasons given by abolitionists to outlaw the practice. The reasons he gave in support of slavery covered a broad spectrum, typical of the Southern justification of slavery. He cited Bible verses that in his mind showed that slavery was condoned, even encouraged, by God himself. He predicted economic catastrophe in not only the southern United   States, but the entire country, if the slaves received freedom. Shannon estimated the value of slaves in the United States at over two billion dollars, a huge financial loss in the event of emancipation. He attempted to refute claims about the immorality of slavery by arguing that the slaves actually benefited from American slavery, saying that under the guidance of the white race the Africans learned how to be civilized. In his conclusion he suggested that once \"all peaceable means to protect our rights, and save the Union\" were exhausted, \"we will stand to arms,\" and \"God will defend the right.\"","            Shannon's arguments for slavery were typical of the rhetoric used by pro-slavery forces in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Southerners believed that they were justified by the law and by God in their practice of slavery, but Shannon's remarks went beyond simply justifying the practice of slavery. Even in 1855, half a decade before the first state seceded from the Union, the idea of secession from the Union was common among Southern pro-slavery forces. The aggressiveness of the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed outlawing slavery in all the land acquired during the Mexican-American War, caught the attention of Southerners. Shannon was among many others who thought that preemptive action was necessary to stop Northern politicians from outlawing slavery. This early support by Southerners for secession and acceptance of violence as a necessary step in order to protect the right to slavery made the American Civil War seem inevitable, even five years before the first shot was fired."],"display_date":"July 13, 1855","search_date":"1855-07-13","locations":[{"id":7668,"lat":39.0656247172,"lng":-93.7855117112,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3914,"title":"Opposition to Freedom\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-31","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On the last day of 1889, an editor of the <em>Roanoke Daily Times</em> criticized \"the relations of the races,\" which, he avowed, \"do not appear to be at all improved by the election of a Republican president.\"  The editor continued, affirming that black people had \"become restless and arrogant in a large measure, and ready at any time to enter on the work of bloodshed and murder.\"  This was not the case under the presidency of Democrat Grover Cleveland, who assured justice and contentment for all black citizens, the editor argued.  While this editorial in the New Year's Eve edition of the <em>Times </em>was brief, it nevertheless emphasized that blacks were still a threat to society, especially under the administration of Republican President Benjamin Harrison.  Moreover, the editorial highlighted growing white backlash in Virginia against the rights that African Americans gained following the Civil War. ","            Numerous reasons explain why the editor of the <em>Times</em> criticized Harrison's administration and the situation of black Americans.  Harrison took office in 1888 having defeated Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat.  Running on a platform of \"Rejuvenated Republicanism,\" Harrison received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Cleveland, and he alienated strongly Democratic areas of the country as he took office in 1889.  Additionally, his support for black civil rights and his appointment of Frederick Douglass as a foreign minister to Haiti further angered his opposition.  Cleveland, on the other hand, had supported returning captured Confederate flags to former Confederate states and had expressed federal appreciation of Confederate soldiers.  Harrison's failure to engender support from Democrats and former Confederates resulted in the 1892 re-election of Cleveland in the most decisive presidential election in 20 years.","            The advancement of civil rights legislation that followed the Civil War was a source of opposition to black citizens.  Historians Nancy Bentlen and Sandra Gunning write that after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, \"African American men were suddenly free to enter local and national government during Reconstruction.\"  Philip A. Bruce's publication of <em>The Plantation Negro as a Freeman</em> in 1889 reflected growing white opposition to black freedom.  Characterizing black men as immoral and rebellious, Bruce \"devoted a great deal of time to writing Southern history that directly aided and abetted the post-Reconstruction backlash against African Americans, arguing that as they moved beyond slavery, blacks were inevitably devolving into barbarism.\"  ","            Both the administration of Harrison and the advancement of black rights that took place after the Civil War and Reconstruction gave rise to this editorial.  Its criticisms and fears reflected those of white Virginians across the state, many of whom were staunchly Democratic and still loyal to the former Confederacy.

He conveyed his deep desire to have President Cleveland attend the Lynchburg Fair in October in order to rescue Virginia from falling into the hands of the Mahoneites and out of the hands of the Democrats.  McDonald continued on in his letter to list the various means by which the President could arrive in Lynchburg and depart in a timely manner.

The movement aimed to lower state debt by enacting liberal reforms, including broadening education opportunities for black citizens.  Gaining the nickname \"the party of the Negro,\" the Readjuster Movement won a degree of support in the early 1880s for its financial policies.  Additionally, Mahone sought alliances with Republican officeholders in order to gain more political salience.  Pleas like that of McDonald arose, therefore, out of Democrats' fear of Republican and Readjuster control of state-and even national-politics.

In Lynchburg, former Confederate General Jubal Early avowed, \"the Negroes must know that they are to behave themselves and keep in their proper places.\"  McDonald believed that staunchly Democratic Cleveland was an effective counterbalance to the Readjuster movement, and he therefore attempted to feature him as the central figure in Lynchburg's 1887 Fair."],"display_date":"August 22, 1887","search_date":"1887-08-22","locations":[{"id":13702,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3936,"title":"Lunsford Lane Finds Freedom\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Lunsford Lane, a former slave, confidently declared in his autobiography, \"I strove to keep self-possessed and employed in my mind day and night planning how I might be FREE.\"  Lunsford Lane was born a slave in Raleigh, North Carolina and self-published an autobiography in 1845 recounting his experiences in slavery and his determination to buy his and his family's freedom.  Lane was born and raised in a relatively pleasant environment (compared to other slaves) on a large plantation with over 250 slaves.  As a child, Lane played with the white children, but as he grew up, Lane said, \"I discovered the difference between myself and my master's white children.\"  While they began to read and write, Lane began to work in the fields and was not permitted to touch a book.  However, throughout most of Lunsford Lane's experience as a slave, he worked as a \"body servant and waiter in his master's fine mansion\" and did not suffer the toils of fieldwork.  In fact, he seemed to appreciate living in North Carolina because he said there was a constant fear of being sold to the Deep South, where slavery was harsher.  As soon as Lane discovered the possibility of buying one's freedom, he set to work, night and day.  He began selling peaches and marbles whenever he had the chance and eventually sold prepared smoking tobacco and pipes at fifteen and ten cents each, becoming known as a tobacconist around town.  He worked and went into town to sell his products late at night and early in the morning, living an exhausting lifestyle.  Lane eventually married, and had six children, and raised 1,000 dollars to purchase his freedom.  Lane describes the feeling once freed, \"I cannot describe it, only it seemed as though I was in heaven.\"  Soon after, he bought his entire family for 3,000 dollars.  However, Lane ran into many problems with the North Carolina court, which had many laws about free blacks living in North Carolina.  Lane included all the court documents in his autobiography and revealed all the complex social and economic dynamics that informed race relations in the antebellum South.  His published narrative is not explicitly argumentative against slavery yet Lane's account gave hope and possibility to slaves at the time.

Ford realized early that his company was in for a tough battle.  As a captain in the cavalry of the Confederate States Army, he worried about the lack of leadership in his unit.  After all, Colonel Price, the only man who seemed to know how to \"form a line of battle,\" was fighting on the other side of the state.  As Ford glanced across Spring  River, which was the only thing separating Ford's army from General Sigel's Federal troops, he was mesmerized: \"I could not help admiring for their beautiful movements in their formation line of battle.\"   He knew his men had a small chance of winning the skirmish, but they had no choice.  Suddenly, gunfire erupted.  The battle of Carthage had begun.","    The battle raged on for hours.  It was a back and forth affair, as each side would rally after what seemed like defeat.  Desperate for a victory, Captain Hiram, a colleague of Ford's, commanded the Confederate soldiers to throw anything they could at General Sigel's men.  The cavalry threw rocks and pieces of iron.  Soon, General Sigel began to retreat from the constant bombardment.  Before long, Ford and the cavalry had pushed him back ten miles from Carthage, sealing the Confederate victory.  After the battle, Sigel, reflecting on the battle, applauded the efforts of the Confederate cavalry: \"if [I] had such men in [my] command...[I] would not be afraid to charge hell and capture the devil.\"","    While the determination and drive of the Missouri soldiers threw General Sigel off guard, their resolve is not surprising.  The Kansas-Missouri conflict served as a prelude to the Civil War.  Each state dealt with raids and guerilla warfare on a consistent basis beginning in 1854, so the two states were in the midst of the conflict when the War Between the States broke out.  When the war officially started, Lincoln's top priority was to try and secure the loyalty of the Border   States.  While Lincoln was able to attract Kansas to the Union cause, Missouri, a slave state, sympathized with the Southern plight and, while it never seceded, did favor the Confederacy.  This division between Kansas and Missouri only reinforced the hostility.  For the soldiers in Captain Ford's company, they not only saw Federal troops before them - they saw Kansas, the neighbors they hated the most.

He wrote to the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates in regards to the South Carolina Nullification Ordinance, and the newspaper posted this as an article for locals.  Floyd explained that South Carolina felt the Tariffs took advantage of it and the state had \"declared those laws unconstitutional.\"  In South   Carolina's defense, he noted that its state had implored Congress to overturn those laws many times, but that \"all this had been disregarded by that body.\"  Although Floyd first presented South Carolina's motives for nullification, he went on to note the potentially negative consequences of this action.  The Virginia governor warned that \"should force be resorted to by the Federal Government, the horror of the scenes hereafter to be witnessed cannot now be pictured even by the affrighted imagination.\"  Floyd presented both sides of the issue.  ","Floyd's desires for how Virginians should respond to nullification, more clearly revealed his inclinations.  Historians describe the governor as a \"states' rights advocate\" who \"originally opposed secession.\" These two ideas seemingly conflicted with each other.  Floyd promoted an all-encompassing stance that would preserve South Carolina's rights and also promoted the ideal of limiting Congressional powers without endorsing nullification. He said that first there should be \"an investigation of the causes, with a view to a redress of grievances.\"  However, he acknowledged that South Carolina had already attempted to do this and failed.  Thus, he said the next step was \"an amicable reference...to the great tribunal which formed and adopted the constitution, viz: the PEOPLE of the States themselves.\"  Floyd went so far as to say that if the people could not settle the issue peacefully, it would essentially disparage the ideas of \"liberty\" and \"self-government.\"  Therefore, he presented the state of Virginia with two choices: to support South  Carolina and engage in potential Civil War or to \"appeal to the States of the Union.\"  He warned that the former of the two choices would result in \"fire-side altars bathed in blood,\" and that the latter decision would enable \"the maintenance of...harmony.\"  Floyd presented the two options as having completley different consequences.","Virginia had a task: historian William Freehling explains that ultimately \"the Virginia legislature, even while sending [an official commissioner] to stop South Carolina from nullifying [the tarrifs], affirmed that any state could legally secede.\"  Although Virginia remained in the Union until the fall of Fort Sumter, it did not condemn the actions of the secessionists around it.  This somewhat conciliatory legislative action, as Floyd suggested, would have less severe effects. Interestingly, though, Floyd eventually became a promoter of secession, a Confederate general, and as historians note, \"resigned under charges of financial cheating and transferring arms to the South.\"  Overall, it is evident that Virginians initially took a moderate stance, hoping to avoid confrontation.  As time progressed, however, many people modified their attitudes and behaviors, as exemplified by Governor Floyd and Virginia's eventual secession."],"display_date":"December 19, 1832","search_date":"1832-12-19","locations":[{"id":13654,"lat":37.3167903952,"lng":-79.5201576467,"zoom":9,"place":"BEDFORD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3958,"title":"To Protect and Serve: Overlooked White Crimes\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-09-03","end_date":"1890-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The black woman was badly injured.

The family maintained hope that they would finally see racial equality and justice converge.  Unfortunately, however, the day that the beaten woman would receive the justice she truly deserved would never come.

He focused his attention on an innocent black woman who seemed out of place in the area.  After questioning the \"suspicious\" woman, Policeman Saunders decided to arrest her.  The woman resisted the seemingly unwarranted arrest and the result was bloodshed.  The police officer brutally beat the woman over the head numerous times with his billet.  As news of the savage beating spread throughout Charlottesville, individuals of the black community banded together, demanding that the officer be tried for excessive and unjust force.   The demands of justice by the black community were ignored by the white politicians and the police officer went unpunished.  ","            Black inferiority was an uncontested aspect of the South during late 1800s.  The failure of Reconstruction allowed blatant racism to become an accepted part of the Southern states.   Whites often used violence to instill fear in the minds of black Southerners in an attempt to regain the level of control which they had prior to the Civil War.  This rampant violence and widespread fear shaped and defined the relationships between blacks and whites during the late nineteenth century.   To remedy this overt discrimination in the Southern states, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which made it illegal to discriminate against blacks by assigning them an inferior legal and economic status.  Approximately two years later the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing \"equal protection of the laws\" to every American citizen.   In response to this legislation, however, the Southern states passed a new set of laws that \"permitted local officials to informally discriminate against blacks.\"   The actions of the Southern states following national legislation indicate a desperate effort to retain a position a position of superiority over newly freed black Southerners.  Unfortunately, the desperate attempt to maintain a sense of white supremacy in the South resulted in the disappearance of any form of legal justice in the black community.  The absence of legal action against Policeman Saunders is just one example of the widespread acts of injustice which plagued blacks across the United   States following the abolition of slavery.

It was only following this decision that a convention was held to declare West Virginia separate in May 1861. This started the process which eventually led to Lincoln's recognition of the division of Virginia in 1863. West Virginia was not interested in reunification in 1866 as they had long seen themselves as separate from the rest of Virginia. They resented the fact that east Virginia had better representation in Congress, as its constituencies were smaller. In addition, the tax breaks of those in the slave-holding east angered the west, as slaveholders were exempt from paying taxes on their slaves. Geographic divisions further helped create a feeling of separation and an unwillingness to defend their neighbors in the east against the Union.","Debt became a problem for Virginia following the Civil War as Virginia had been the battleground for the war and was now devastated as a result. In addition, West Virginia's secession had deprived Virginia of a third of its tax-paying population. Virginia thus needed to ensure that West   Virginia shared the burden of debt from costs incurred before the Civil War. However, this was not resolved quickly; it was only in 1911 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling which forced West Virginia to pay its share of the debt.

It all began in 1828 when Congress enacted the so-called Tariff of Abominations. Many Southerners thought the highly protective tariff was detrimental to agrarian interests.  Under the leadership of John C. Calhoun, South Carolina stated that a national tariff was unconstitutional when it benefited some states and not others.  To ease tension, President Andrew Jackson lowered the tariff in July 1832.  It was not enough.  ","In November of 1832, South Carolina's Nullification Convention met and pronounced both tariffs unconstitutional as well as unenforceable.  If the national government made any attempt to enforce the tariff, South Carolina would secede from the Union.  In response, Jackson sent the tactical strategist Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott and \"five additional companies of Artillery and two companies of the fourth regiment of Infantry\" to Charleston.  On December 10, 1832, Jackson sent a message to South Carolina declaring its actions \"inconsistent\" and \"incompatible.\"  ","While South Carolina reacted vehemently to the tariff, many Virginians demurred.  South     Carolina's governor James Hamilton mentioned that Nullification was a \"peaceful and constitutional\" remedy.  The Lynchburg Virginian, however, scoffed at his diction and saw war and revolution ahead, not peace.  Governor Hamilton readied the State Guard in Charleston and requested the removal of U.S. troops from the state citadel in Charleston.  The paper claimed, \" war is no children's game - least of all, civil war, in which personal revenge is so apt to mingle with the public quarrel.\"  Though Lynchburg was against the actions of its Southern neighbor, Whigs in Richmond were inclined toward Nullification.  In the coming years, Virginia's divisive tendencies would play a more important role."," After the threat of military action, South Carolina agreed to compromise and a much lower tariff was passed in 1833.

A year earlier in June 1885, Woods, an attorney from Charlottesville, was appointed and was \"in sympathy with the political tenets of the majority of the board...and recommended by some of the professors.\"  Now, he was worried about his reappointment because he feared that it would \"be decided on political principle.\" If he was not reelected, Woods let the rector know that he understood it would be \" a direct reflection upon my efficiency as an officer or upon my political standing.\"  His own political party in the past nine months of office came into conflict with the University and he adamantly stated that he would believe it a direct reflection of his political affiliations if not reelected.  By acknowledging the influence and the consequences associated with political leanings, Woods understood that merit alone was not worth much in the corrupt world of nineteenth century politics. ","    Whether or not he received the position, Woods expressed a realistic fear of the late nineteenth century.  Corruption was rampant in the 1880s, especially in the political arena.  Political machines and party bosses abounded and the civil service was a mess of personal favors and nepotism.  In his first term as President from 1885 until 1889, Grover Cleveland worked to bring an end to such corruption.  In the wake of fraudulent Boss Tweed and in the presence of the powerfully corrupt Tammany Hall machine, Cleveland's campaign of political honesty appealed to many citizens.  These citizens voted for his morality in the election of 1884 that pitted Cleveland, a Democrat, against a bribe-accepting Republican candidate. As president, Cleveland was able to convince the Republican dominated Senate to repeal the Tenure of Office Act.  When Cleveland came into office, many inept Republicans dominated the federal bureaucracy.  He wished to replace the incompetent with the worthy.  The act dictated that the Senate had to approve dismissals and appointments.  This was problematic for Cleveland since Republicans had the majority.  Arguing that the act was unconstitutional, he got his repeal and the additional executive powers the Constitution provided.  Though he did not bring an end to corruption, Cleveland's little steps led to more significant changes in the future.","    It is no wonder that citizens like Woods would worry about the effects of political leanings when political favoritism was everywhere.  Gradually, the corruption and patronage so ubiquitous in late nineteenth and early twentieth century politics subsided, due in part to the example President Cleveland set in both of his terms.

The tariff placed a high tax on foreign goods to stimulate domestic manufacturing, and, in turn, placed strains on the Southern economy as the British reduced their imports of cotton.  Many declared the tariff unconstitutional and thought that it infringed upon the individual states' rights.  To quell the South's angered reaction, Jackson issued the Tariff of 1832, which made some reductions on tax rates.  This did not satisfy everyone, however, and South Carolina acted against the federal government by calling a state convention.  The convention voted for nullification of the tariffs, viewing them as a threat to liberty and founding principles of the United States ","While some Southerners were appalled at the rash decision for nullification and saw the tariffs as simply an element of the democratic style of central government, many also shared feelings of resentment and frustration.

As the headline so boldly announced, the days of the Confederacy were severely numbered as General Robert E. Lee was forced to abandon Goldsboro, NC and proved unable to hold the city of Raleigh. In reality, of course, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia remained in Virginia, but was trying to reach North Carolina after abandoning Richmond on April 2. A gloomy sentiment laid beneath the description of Lee's retreat as \"highly detrimental to the discipline of the force which has the final destiny of the Confederacy in its keeping.\" Lee's troops were backed into the state of Virginia and essentially surrounded by the forces of General Grant and General Sherman. Here the paper rallied that Lee would need to \"fight out the last battle of the rebellion or to ignominiously surrender.\" However, the paper seemed to acknowledge and allude to a certain valor in General Lee by claiming that he recognized \"the impossibility of achieving the independence of the Confederacy by the sword.\" With this comment, it seemed as if the people of the South recognized that they would fall under the weight of the Union army but that they would fall with dignity and pride.","    In the final days of the war, the citizens of the Confederacy were aware that their days were numbered and that they could not hold out against Union forces for much longer. Only two days after this article was published, Robert E. Lee surrendered his troops at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, bringing an end to the bloody conflict that had raged on between the divided nation for nearly four years. Although this was an unhappy ending for the citizens of the Confederate States, who had battled so hard to gain independence, according to Stephen Ash, \"even among those who were still prepared to bear the costs of victory there were growing doubts about the instrument they had forged to secure that victory.\" Since the majority of the battles were fought on Confederate soil, the war had severely disrupted family life, tearing families apart and causing many of those on the home front to constantly be surrounded by troops and the destruction they caused. Though many Southerners entered the war with the desire to see the Confederacy prosper as an independent nation, by April 1865, they were willing to accept defeat if it meant that they would be able to put their lives back together.

President of Washington College and slaveholder Dr. Henry Ruffner delivered an address in 1847 that outlined the evils of slavery and proposed the gradual eradication of slavery from western Virginia.  In correspondence to Messrs. Moore, Letcher, &c, Ruffner wrote, \"as we are nearly all slaveholders, and none of us approve of the principles and measures of the sect of abolitionists, we think that no man can be offended with us for offering to the people an argument whose sole object is to show that the prosperity of our West Virginia-if not East Virginia also,--would be promoted by removing gradually the institution of slavery, in a manner consistent with the rights and interests of slaveholders.\"  He delivered this speech first to the Franklin Literary Society of Lexington, Virginia, at the close of debates on the division of the state of Virginia.  Ruffner afterwards compiled his emancipation argument into the \"Ruffner pamphlet,\" which made its debut in September 1847.  Throughout his speech, Ruffner rejected the extremes of both abolitionism and pro-slavery extremism, claiming the \"middle way.\"","Unlike the abolitionists, who objected to slavery on moral grounds, Ruffner objected to the economic problems that slavery created.  His protest matched that of trans-Allegheny legislators who called slavery the sure route to economic stagnation.  In western counties, such as the Kanawha Valley, where Ruffner spent his childhood, slavery was not profitable and often took jobs from white laborers.  He argued that, \"our own West Virginia furnishes conclusive evidence, that slavery....has a pernicious influence on the public welfare.\"  Most people in western Virginia engaged in livestock and small farming operations where slavery was not economical.  Industries, such as the Kanawha salt industry, leased and hired slaves, often from eastern Virginia, for lower wages than white laborers demanded.  Any such encouragement to the growth of slave population west of the Blue Ridge, Ruffner felt, was dangerous to the free labor population.  He compared the slave states with free states to provide concrete examples of his logic-\"In the older free states are seen all tokens of prosperity....  In the older parts of the slave states, -with a few local exceptions,-are seen, on the contrary, too evident signs of stagnation or of positive decay....\"  Thus, as Ruffner reasoned, the institution of slavery would not allow the western Virginian economy to prosper.  It was on this basis that Ruffner placed his overall argument.","Ruffner united his discussion of slavery with the \"white basis\" for representation in the legislature, asserting that the two were intertwined.  Representation in the Virginia General Assembly favored eastern Virginia over its western counterpart due to the imbalance of slave populations.  Indeed, western politicians were bitter against east Virginia for using their power to retain the mixed basis of representation and to deny to western Virginia its rights.  Ruffner's argument was coherent with the general sentiments of westerners at the time who attacked both the practice of unequal representation and the institution of slavery.  In them, they saw the sole causes of their political degradation and of their arrested social and economic development.  Historian Charles Ambler noted that \"arguments opposing and supporting these two extremes were poured forth in profusion in the Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 and in the assembly of 1831-1832, where the expediency of legislating upon the abolition of negro slavery was the chief subject of discussion.\"  Ruffner reminded his audience of the measure introduced in Virginia's legislature proposing gradual emancipation:  \"and so the people of West Virginia then thought, for they were generally and warmly in favor of it, and zealously advocated it through their able and patriotic Delegates.  But in spite of their efforts, it was rejected by the all powerful Eastern majority, though several Eastern delegates joined the West in its support.\" ","In the conclusion of his argument for the necessity of action to remove the institution of slavery from West Virginia, Ruffner outlined a scheme for such a removal with six major components.  He proposed foremost that further importation of slaves be prohibited and that the exportation of slaves be freely permitted (with the exception that children of slaves born after a certain day, not be exported after they had reached five years of age).  Next, he advised that the existing generation of slaves remain in their present condition (but that their offspring born after a certain day should be emancipated at no later than 25 years of age).  Furthermore, Ruffner felt that masters should be required to teach the \"heirs of emancipation\" reading, writing and arithmetic, that the emancipated slaves be colonized, and finally, that the law allow any county to decree the removal or emancipation of all slaves of the county within a certain term of years.  ","  It was not until eighteen months after Ruffner's death, when the Union admitted West Virginia as a legal state, that its constitution provided for a gradual emancipation plan similar to the system proposed by Ruffner.  The legal emancipation of slaves in West Virginia did not take place until February 3, 1865, when the governor approved an act abolishing slavery, providing for the immediate emancipation of all slaves.  They had finally taken the course of action that Ruffner had called for--\"Now fellow citizens, it is for you to determine whether the slavery question shall be considered, discussed and decided, at this critical, this turning point of your country's history...may heaven direct your minds to the course dictated by patriotism, by humanity and by your own true interest.\"  "],"display_date":"September 1847","search_date":"1847-09-15","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4032,"title":"Radicalism vs. Rationality\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-15","end_date":"1832-12-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On Saturday, December 15, 1832, the <em>Virginia Herald</em> expressed its grief over the Nullification Crisis with the words, \"alarming as the crisis...is, we cling to the hope, that for the sake of humanity and the honor of our country and her institutions, that means of averting the impending storm may yet be devised...\" While regretting the approaching conflict, the Virginia newspaper never showed support for the doctrine of nullification. Instead, the publication printed both South Carolina and President Jackson's addresses, presenting both sides of the issue. Although it expressed its belief in the sanctity of the Constitution, the newspaper never alluded to whether it approved more of Jackson or South Carolina's constitutional theory. Virginia, like several other Southern states, often struggled to reconcile her beliefs in state sovereignty and in preservation of the Union. However, fearing the damage a military confrontation would cause, the paper expressed desperate desire for compromise stating, \"In common with our countrymen, we shall consider civil bloodshed as to be the most direful calamity that can possibly befall this free and happy land.\"  "," Early in President Jackson's administration, Congress passed the protective tariff of 1828, which quickly came to be known to the South as the \"Tariff of Abominations.\" The tariff intended to protect Northern industry from competing European goods by placing a higher tax on such products. Cotton planters felt the tariff explicitly alienated them because it made their cost of living more expensive and greatly diminished Great Britain's cotton imports. Although the tariff was abrasive to all Southern states, under the leadership of Vice President and states' rights champion, John C. Calhoun, South Carolina led the rally against it. Calling the tariff unconstitutional because it failed to promote the general welfare, Calhoun called for nullification, a doctrine that allowed states to void federal legislation if it breached the constitutional contract made between the states and the federal government. Taking an immediate stand against nullification President Jackson exclaimed, \"...the power to annul a law ... is incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the...Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive for the great object for which it was formed.\" "," At the start of the crisis, most Southern states shared South Carolina's hatred of the tariff, but never quite embraced the radicalism of nullification. The attitude the <em>Virginia Herald</em> took in December 1832 was characteristic of the rest Southern states' feelings about the crisis. These states relied on their representatives in Congress to rectify the tariff issue instead of taking matters into their own hands.  While they were ardent supporters of states' rights, most were unwilling to risk bloodshed, or worse, separation from the Union in favor of nullification. Most Southern states viewed this method as Alabama's legislature did, \"unsound in theory, and dangerous in practise.\" Instead, the majority of the South favored a logical compromise to the sectional controversy. Nevertheless, December 1832 marked a volatile month in politics, giving birth to unprecedented radicalism, thus stimulating a call for Southern rationality.

Paying more attention to the Army Appropriation bill, funding for public building, and the Railroad Attorney's Bill, the article hardly focused on women's perpetual disenfranchisement. While one senator presented the petition and stated his favor for suffrage because it would make \"Washington the best illustration of the republican idea of self-government,\" another discarded the resolution asserting, \"He would not degrade woman by giving her the right of suffrage.\" Following this short exchange of ideas, the Senate voted on the measure, defeating it 34 to 16. The <em>Virginian </em>delivered the result of the vote, gave no commentary on the issue, and immediately resumed discussion of the public buildings' appropriation."," In 1887, Southern men still retained the idea that it was their duty to protect women's virtue, one of the most significant aspects of the prevailing honor culture. Men saw politics as too intense for ladies to concern themselves with, for it often embodied corruption and uncensored dialogue. Women were the ethical compass in Southern households, thus many men thought involvement in politics would not only taint their image, but their moral fiber as well. Furthermore, as Horace Bushnell points out, men commonly held the belief that women were incapable of making sound decisions when voting because they went \"more by feeling than men, they feel every thing more intensely, and with more liabilities to excess.\" ","It was also still common for many families to ascribe to traditional gender roles of the antebellum period. Nicholas Bromell's book, <em>By the Sweat of the Brow</em>, also notes that men were usually the primary providers while women occupied their own \"sphere,\" remaining in the home to be the family's religious authority and caretaker. Thus, at the time there was no place for women in politics because the defining characteristic of their \"sphere\" was that it made a clear distinction between \"home and world.\" The cult of domesticity continued to have a heavy influence on Southern life in the 1880s, therefore delaying women's right to vote. "," The <em>Virginian Weekly & Carolinian's </em>apathetic attitude towards women's suffrage was synonymous with the majority of Southern male ideas on the issue. Things like internal improvements and government funding were much higher priorities at the time. Men were not ready to conflate the gender spheres and include women in self-government because they saw them unfit to do its bidding. The voting booth was a male arena; women were the spectators.

In one of the articles, the editorial staff of the Enquirer expressed their feelings about nullification. The editorial staff of the Enquirer stated that although \"from the moment this paper saw the light, it has been the devoted friend of the Rights of the States,\" and they were \"opposed to the abominable Tariff system,\" they were \"equally opposed to the course which South Carolina has taken.\" ","The Enquirer was strongly Democratic; in the same issue there was an article celebrating the reelection of Andrew Jackson. The fact that it was both Democratic and Southern, make it seem likely that the editorial staff of the Enquirer would have supported--or at least sympathized with--John C.

","Robert Remini noted in his biography of President Jackson that although most Southern states were angry about the tariff, none went as far as South Carolinians did. The fact that the Enquirer referred to nullification as \"an absurd and a dangerous heresy\" demonstrates that the political climate in South Carolina was much more radical than that of other Southern states in the early 1830s. By the 1860s, however when the Southern states began to secede from the Union, the political climate had changed dramatically.

In his speech, Davis mentioned his appreciation of Raleigh natives, who kept his wife and children in refuge. In addition, Davis seemed to respect the people of North  Carolina, as the North   Carolina people seemed genuinely happy to meet them. Davis mentioned finding problems with the state militia. Davis, however, expressed his confidence in the Confederate armies even though Confederate soldiers were outnumbered at times.

Although Davis initially wished not to obtain the position of president, he treated everyone fairly and wished everyone the best.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4082,"title":"Desertion Plagues the Confederate War Effort\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-15","end_date":"1865-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In February 1865, the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> printed a general order for those who had lost faith in the Confederate war effort and deserted, offering them a way to honorably rejoin their fellow Confederates in the fight. As many Confederate soldiers deserted and returned to their families, General Robert E. Lee appealed to their \"honor and duty\" by presenting only two options: \"war [or] abject submission.\" The only logical choice seemed to be a continuation of the fight for self-government at any cost. Lee offered pardon to any man \"improperly absent\" as long as he returned \"within the shortest possible time within 20 days.\" He declared that \"no general amnesty [would] again be granted\" in this final effort to reabsorb deserters into the Army of the Confederacy. Unfortunately for Lee, offering a sweeping pardon did not significantly recoup his dwindling supply of men still willing to fight.","Historians have pointed to desertion as one of the primary reasons for the South's defeat in the Civil War. The notion of the Civil War being a \"rich man's war, and a poor man's fight\" was a huge factor in desertion rates. One school of thought believes that as the war progressed, the yeoman farmers who were doing the majority of the fighting came to resent the planter aristocracy that was often exempted from military service due to various Confederate policies. The war became increasingly difficult, and many soldiers deserted due to economics, family, and personal sentiments. The less a man identified with the cause he was fighting for, the more likely he was to desert. Yeoman farmers did not own slaves, and the principles of slavery were not worth fighting and dying for as the war proceeded. In the final months of the war, desertion rates escalated as it became clear that the South would not emerge the victors.","James McPherson examines the Confederate soldier's experience through various diaries and letters and disagrees with this position. McPherson claims that Confederate men did not gain the conventional disillusionment and cynicism that would logically lead to desertion. The sources that he examines show soldiers continuing to assert the importance of the ideals they were fighting for throughout the conflict. Reasons for fighting would include defending their government, their manhood, their families, and their comrades. Although the reasons for desertion are clearly a subject of great debate among historians, it is clear that desertion made it increasingly difficult to pursue the collective goals of the Confederacy on the battlefield and inevitably contributed to Lee's surrender several months later."],"display_date":"February 15, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4083,"title":"Proof of Allegiance\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-27","end_date":"1865-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 25, 1865, John Herbert Claiborne took the oath of allegiance to the United States at the Office of the Provost Marshal in Petersburg, Virginia. He served as a surgeon with the title of Major in the Confederate Army during the war and continued to practice medicine after the surrender. In the terms of the oath he swore to \"support and defend the Constitution\" and to support all laws including \"the emancipation of slaves\" from that time forward. By taking this oath, he secured amnesty for serving the Confederacy during the war, considered an act of treason. That day he received a slip of paper noting that he had taken the oath, but he returned six days later to request a letter from the Provost Marshall confirming his allegiance and giving him permission to purchase a pistol for his own protection. Almost a month later, on June 26, he returned yet again for a duplicate certificate of his Oath of Allegiance. Papers such as these restored J.H. Claiborne and other former Confederates to their status of citizens of the United States during Reconstruction, a time when a Confederate war record often excluded men from the political landscape they once ruled. Generals Lee and Grant determined the terms of the surrender at Appomattox, but this agreement did not begin to address many of the questions created by the end of the struggle. Politicians determined the terms of reunion during the era of Reconstruction. The status of Confederate veterans proved to be a controversial issue in the halls of Congress as well as throughout the South. On one hand, Southerners needed to be punished for their rebellion, and it would be irresponsible to place the same white aristocracy back in power post-war. However, to suppress almost the entire white male population would leave few educated men to rebuild the southern governments.","President Johnson laid out the terms for Confederate amnesty in May 1865 through a proclamation that gave amnesty restoring all rights and property (except for slaves) to ex-Confederates who would take an oath of loyalty to the Union. Exempted from the proclamation were top ranking Confederates, as well as owners of more than 20,000 in property. These southerners who were not given amnesty in the proclamation would have to swallow their pride and appeal to the President Johnson for amnesty. Inevitably Johnson pardoned almost anyone who requested one, a much more lenient policy than the previously proposed Wade-Davis Bill of June 1864 that required men to swear that they had never aided the Confederacy in order to participate politically.

Without you, they are and do nothing. All the responsibility, of the past and present, is yours.\"  GrimkÉ abandons the flattery and puts all of the responsibility of the south's action in the hands of John C. Calhoun.  Thomas GrimkÉ had good reason to worry about the state of the Union and to contact Calhoun for a peace offering.

He was only twenty-nine years old and allied himself with the many other young and rising politicans known as \"War Hawks.\"  Calhoun continued his rise in politics on December 14, 1817, when James Monroe asked him to be his Secretary of War.  Things began to fall apart when a tariff was introduced and Calhoun believed it would make it more difficult for the South to conduct foreign trade through cotton.  Calhoun denounced the abominable tariff saying, \"the great geographical Northern manufacturing interest in order to enforce more effectually the system of monopoly and extortion against the consuming states.\"  In March of 1825, Calhoun became Andrew Jackson's vice president, but drew controvery by writing <em>South Carolina Exposition and Protest</em>.  He defended a states' right to nullify a Federal law that impeded a states' interest, while he was the vice president.  He soon realized he had limited power as the vice president and resigned to be elected Senator of South Carolina.  On November 24, 1832, South Carolina held a contitutional convention and nullified the tariffs of 1824 and 1828, with Calhoun's full support behind his state.  Andrew Jackson's response to the convention came in December of 1832 when he declared nullification as being \"incompatiable with the existence of the Union.\"  This is the time in which GrimkÉ is writing his letter to Calhoun.  ","Thomas GrimkÉ tries to indirectly explain to Calhoun how he would treat the tense situation.

He continues to speak of how a leader should act saying, \"Regard the Constitution of the Union as the sacred covenant of my first-born, sealed with their precious blood, the testimony of their faith, hallowed and irrevocable as the plighted troth of the marriage bond.\"  GrimkÉ refers to the Constitution to be in part of every American family.  ","\"I demand of every public man another prominent duty; to distinguish between the rulers and the people: and honor those, however, unworthy, for the sake of these.\"  He is hoping Calhoun will ignite southerners into supporting the north and the national leaders in office.  \"You have trodden a path, which inferior men might have selected.  Without amazement in their superiors, or danger to your country...That duty was to soothe, not to provoke; to calm, not of passion; of attachments, not jealousness; of manly, candid sense, not of prejudice.\"  This last quote is GrimkÉ's last attempt to persuade John C.

Arrested in New Echota by the Georgia Guard and detained indefinitely, Butler and Worcester were charged with the direct violation of a new Georgia state law which addressed the issue of Americans dwelling within Native American territory. The law, passed on December 22, 1830, created a requirement for white men to declare an oath of loyalty to the Georgia state government and to receive a residency license from the governor. Those who did not abide by these laws would be imprisoned for a minimum of four years hard labor.  Refusing either to take the oath or leave, Butler and Worcester, shackled around the neck, endured the four-day march to Camp Gilmer in Lawrenceville. ","This incident raised questions about the extent of state power and whether Georgia had the right to exert political authority within the Cherokee territory. American Baptist Magazine defended the actions of Butler and Worcester. While Worcester appealed the ruling of the state, in a letter which was summarized in the magazine, Butler claimed that he and Worcester had influenced the convicts at Milledgeville penitentiary: some promised to renounce profanity and other inappropriate behavior. The missionaries led the prisoners in song, religious readings, and prayer sessions. ","This controversy surrounding the power of state government brought the case to the Supreme Court, presided over by Chief Justice John Marshall. The court ruled in favor of Butler and Worcester on March 3, 1832. In his opinion, Marshall declared the laws of Georgia unconstitutional and unenforceable within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. Marshall also ordered the state to reverse its judgment against the two prisoners. Although defiance from the state government continued, Marshall's decision in the case of Worcester v. Georgia represents the pivotal recognition of Cherokee sovereignty within the boundaries of the American Nation and the acknowledgment of their existence as an independent power in the eyes of American law.

According to the <em>New York Evangelist</em>, \"seeing the upper or southern extremity of the village, and probably misunderstanding its extent, he ordered Reno to ford the river, and charge the villagers with three companies, while he, with five companies, moved down the right bank and behind the bluff, to make a similar attack at the other end.\" Reno did as he was told, but soon retreated to the limited cover of the timberline after about 20 minutes of fighting. Custer had told Reno that he would stay near enough to provide Reno's forces with reinforcements, if needed. However, Custer took a diverging route and stumbled upon the village, which was ready to fight. The Native American forces engaged Custer's troops, which were pushed back from the river, through a valley, and onto a high ridge. There, all of Custer's battalion were surrounded and, save for Custer's Crow scout, \"were annihilated by hostile Sioux savages,\" as described in the <em>Prairie Farmer</em>. Fighting continued the remainder of the day and the next, with Reno's forces withstanding Native American attacks until being relieved by generals Terry and Gibbon on the third day, just after the enemy had fled.","According to historian Walter Camp, the battle \"was no massacre; there was no ambush, no trap set for the white troops to enter. It was a battle in three fights, fair and simple. The Indians had met Custer's detachments in detail and defeated them, all within sight of their village.\" Although Custer was widely criticized at the time, the ambiguity surrounding his death gave artists free reign to interpret his final moments. One of the most popular images created by artists since is of \"Custer's Last Stand,\" which most often portrays Custer as a fearless, buckskin-clad man standing firm and stalwart in a swarm of Indians and fallen soldiers, defying death itself. Historian Brian W. Dippie claims, artists \"gave it instantly recognizable form and planted it in our heads.\" Additionally, Custer's widow, Elizabeth, actively campaigned to establish her husband's legacy as a valiant and brazen hero - an effort that was widely successful. ","To whites, the myth of Custer's Last Stand could be interpreted as \"white civilization surrounded, indeed stormed, by white savagery,\" as Dippie suggests. The Prairie Farmer betrays the white majority's opinions of Native Americans as \"hostile savages\" and \"red devils.\" This one-dimensional myth is how the Battle of Little Bighorn was viewed for more than a century. However, in the late twentieth century, efforts were made to explore the Native American outlook on what they termed the Battle of the Greasy Grass. Little Bighorn came at the apex of the United States Government's attempts to subjugate Native Americans by forcing them onto reservations. As suggested by Native American scholar Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., whites \"offered the Indians the same three choices: become whites; stay on reservations, isolated from the rest of us, until you can be assimilated; or resist both choices and die.\" Douglas C. McChristian reiterates this point: \"They knew it as...a great, yet fleeting victory that signaled the doom of their traditional way of life.\" To some, the controversial battle was a symbol of American virtue. Yet to others, the battle reflected the conflict between unending American westward expansion and the Native American defense of their land and way of life. To bridge the gap, many scholars have attempted a more universal reinterpretation of the Battle of Little Bighorn that encompasses both the long-held view of the former and the more recent emergence of the latter."],"display_date":"July 15, 1876","search_date":"1876-07-15","locations":[{"id":8042,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"BIG HORN, Montana"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4123,"title":"Record-Setting Railroad\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-06-01","end_date":"1876-06-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shrouded in a mist of smoke and steam, the train lurched into the station. Having completed its cross-country trip more than four hours ahead of schedule, the Transcontinental Express finally ground to a halt.  The <em>Friends' Intelligencer </em>claimed that the trip, leaving from Jersey City at 1:00 A.M. on June 1, 1876 and arriving in San Francisco approximately half past nine on the morning of the 4th, was made by a speed train in \"26 minutes less than 84 hours,\" or three and a half days. Such a journey in a normal locomotive would have taken seven days. The <em>Scientific American </em>professed the Transcontinental Express \"to be the longest and fastest continuous run that has ever been made on any road in any country.\" This statement reveals the sentiment favoring technological innovation and record setting pace that prevailed in the society during that time. ","Historian Sarah Gordon claims that \"express trains\" were passenger trains that carried express packages and did not stop at every station. She states that these trains \"usually traveled about thirty miles an hour, somewhat faster than other through trains.\" Due to America's burgeoning economy during the 1870s and 1880s, most trains carried a combination of passengers and goods for exchange in other areas. However, slower passenger trains that stopped at every station were available for those who needed it. According to Gordon, these \"accommodation trains ran along through routes, usually at ten to twenty miles per hour.\" While practical use usually dictated the speed of trains, the social status of passengers usually dictated the service, luxury, and safety found onboard, at least initially. The luxurious Pullman cars, decorated in the style of Victorian England, and various private cars were often used by the rich for extended travel. These cars stood in stark contrast to the rancid, poorly lit, and anachronistic passenger cars and day coaches that were frequented by the poor, who often used the railroad for transportation over shorter distances. Eventually, as Gordon postulates, \"the railroads sought to draw all lines under the same rules of operation, regardless of passenger needs. Beginning in the 1880s the science of railroading began to displace remarkable social diversity of passenger travel.\"","Therefore, as railroads such as the Transcontinental Express became faster, more powerful, and more widely used, problems in the system led to the need for regulation and standardization. \"Especially between 1870 and 1900, railroads leaned in the direction of national standards in ticketing, time, track gauges, baggage, the structure of train cars, and the behavior of passengers.\" Not all attempts at standardization were successful. For instance, the Master Car-Builders' Association suggested standard brakes, seats, couplings, heating apparatuses, and ventilating systems on cars during the 1870s, but not all railroads could afford such upgrades to be made. At the same time, attempts were made to set ticket prices, yet none were very successful. On the other hand, many efforts at homogenization were successful. Standard time was universally adopted in 1883, making scheduling significantly easier and more predictable. Also in 1883, railroad companies placed a 250-pound limit on passenger luggage. Three years later, between May 31 and June 1, 1886, most railroads conformed to standard gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches wide, vastly improving the efficiency of transportation as railroads could connect with one another. By 1890, \"a new national standard of reasonable behavior\" permeated the railroad as employees, as well as passengers, were called to abide by a pragmatic code of conduct, \"to make public behavior compatible with urban technology and with the needs of crowds rather than the needs of the individual,\" according to Gordon. While trains such as the Transcontinental Express were setting transportation records, the standards on faster and more powerful trains \"developed to promote the efficient and safe transfer of passengers in all parts of the country.\""],"display_date":"June 1, 1876 - June 4, 1876","search_date":"1876-06-02","locations":[{"id":8523,"lat":40.7416518725,"lng":-74.0773468609,"zoom":11,"place":"HUDSON, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4141,"title":"Southern Benefits from the Compromise of 1850\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-09-05","end_date":"1851-09-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The North and South had reached a stalemate, the compromise measures had been debated for over ten months.  Finally, an agreement was reached.  In September of 1850 the provisions that would become the Compromise of 1850 were passed.  About a year later, on September 5, 1851, Winchester Graham, a representative from South Carolina, gave a speech in Barnwell, S.C. that defended his support of the Compromise measures.  In the beginning of his speech, Graham called the compromise \"...the greatest legislative victory to be found in the annals of our country and that the institutions of the South are now resting on firmer foundations than they ever had before...\"  Next, Graham gave an overview of the major pieces of the compromise.  First, Graham talked about the abolition of the slave trade in Washington, D.C.  He argued that this was of no consequence to the South and that the Congress had the power to regulate the commerce of the District of Columbia.  Second, he talked about the admittance of California as a free state.  He dispelled the myth that this was a policy of the Free Soil Party intended to entrap the South, and argued that slavery would never have come to California because of its climate and terrain.  Graham supported the admittance of California as a whole, instead of divided at the 36' 30' line of the Missouri Compromise, because if it had been split it would allow two free states to come into the Union instead of one.  Third, Graham argued that the Texas-New Mexico border act, long viewed as an assault on the slave state of Texas, was proposed by a southerner, Pearce of Maryland, and was beneficial to the Southern cause.  This measure helped the South because it paid of the debts of Texas and also gave the South \"40,000 miles of free territory\" to establish new slave states to bolster Texas and the South.  Finally, the Fugitive Slave Act was a major victory for the South because it allowed for greater protection and return of their property, the slaves.  In conclusion, Graham said that the Compromise led the nation away from the brink of succession; this succession would have caused a costly war that would have taken a horrific toll on the South. ","    The debate over the Compromise of 1850 was one of the most contentious and heated debates in the history of the United States Senate.  Political fanatics, from the North and South, objected to the measures, bringing the nation to brink of disunion and hostility.  Author John Waugh argues that the compromise was built on the back of the \"political middle\" with measures that were meant to appease the North, the admittance of California, and ones to appease the South, the Fugitive Slave Act.  While the other measures, especially the Texas-New Mexico border act, represented a political quagmire, from which both sides refused to relent.  In his defense of the Compromise, Graham interpreted all of the measures as strengthening the South, even the concessions to the North.  His speech was an appeal to his constituents, making them realize that the compromise, and his support of it, led them away form the disaster of succession while also helping the Southern cause.  Graham wanted his constituents to view the measures as a victory, not as a compromise, because it helped avoid the destruction of the Union and reinforced slavery in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-09-05","locations":[{"id":11437,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4142,"title":"President Jackson Responds to Nullification\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-10","end_date":"1832-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    The crisis threatened to tear the nation apart.  This crisis was the passage of the Nullification Ordinances by the South Carolina State Assembly in November of 1832.  The unity and survival of the nation depended upon President Andrew Jackson's response.  On December 10, 1832, President Jackson presented his response to the Congress, arguing that the justification for state nullification of federal laws was misguided, unconstitutional, and treasonous to the country.   Jackson began his proclamation by outlining the reasons and reservations that led South Carolina to pass the ordinance; their major concerns were the tariffs of May 29, 1828 and June 14, 1832.  South Carolina believed these measures were unfair and didn't fall within the constitutional power of Congress to raise revenue; they proclaimed the laws null and void and threatened succession.  In his address, Jackson showed that the doctrine of nullification was \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"   First, he posited that South Carolina's objections based on stated powers and fairness were misguided and incorrect because the Constitution gave Congress the \"discretionary power\" to raise revenue by taxation.  Next, Jackson argued the Constitution joined the states into a single nation, and \"in becoming parts of a nation...they surrender many of their essential parts of sovereignty.\"  Thus, secession was wholly unconstitutional because it is an affront to national authority.  Finally, Jackson warned the people of South Carolina, who he believed were tricked into nullification by political and social leaders, that any action of \"disunion, by force, is treason.\"  He made an emotional appeal for these people to see the error of their position.  His address ends with a hope that the nation will survive and be reconciled by reasonableness and harmony, but also an assurance that it will be reconciled by force, if necessary.  ","    President's Jackson's speech came at a crucial time during his presidency; he had just been elected to a second term, but already his popular and political support was flagging.  But, according to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jackson's handling of the nullification crisis and his resolve to ensure the survival of the union, both evident in the December speech, gained him temporary \"popular acclaim,\" making him the \"country's hero.\"  Jackson, a shrewd political, turned his new popularity into a political weapon to further the other policies of his administration, most notably his continued war against the Bank of the United States.  Jackson's speech and eventual handling of the nullification crisis were viewed, by the majority of the nation, as the actions of a strong leader dedicated to the nation and its survival; he used this renewed trust to further the political goals of his presidency.

This was a road that led to economic prosperity for the South.  This was the Blue Ridge Railroad.  In 1860, the President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, Edward Frost, in a report to the stockholders and the state legislature, reported on the condition and growth of the line, proposed a plan for its expansion, and requested renewed assistance from the government of South Carolina.  Frost started his report with a proposition to finish the railroad form Walhalla, S.C. to Clayton, S.C. Then, he reported on the past development of the railroad; noting that from 1859 to 1860, the government instructed and only provided the company with enough of a grant, 310,000, to finish the line up to Walhalla.  The railroad was initially planned to run all along the Southeast, from South Carolina to Knoxville, Tennessee.  But, the company ran into work stoppages and reduced state funding in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  In this report, Frost proposed that the South Carolina legislature provide funding to finish the line to Clayton.  He argued that this would provide the other surrounding state governments with the incentive to fund the completion of the other proposed sections of the railroad, the sections in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northwest Georgia.  But, the railroad would have to be finished to Clayton, because it was a connecting city to these other areas.  According to the report, the completion of the road would be a major economic advantage, linking markets throughout the South.  Frost argued that the completed road would make this section of the South competitive with Northern industry and transportation.  Frost estimated the cost of the line from Walhalla to Clayton at about 1.5 million to 2 million and the total cost of the road to Knoxville at 4.5 million.  He asked the state legislature to provide 1 million in bonds to continue construction to Clayton.  Finally, Frost made a plea to his stockholders:  \"...in case the work should be discontinued, the officers of this company should be exempt from any aspersions of bad judgment or ill faith...\"  This report was intended to show his proposition and his plan, but if the state legislature didn't grant the bonds, Frost wanted to ensure the security of his position. ","    There was a major disparity in railroad transportation between the North and South; this lack of a developed transportation system would later be seen as a major cause of the Southern loss during the Civil War.   The case of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company is indicative of this trend of struggling railroads in the South.  Historian James Ward showed that Southern railroads, especially in the 1840s and mid-1850s, received less government aide and investment than their Northern counterparts.  He argued that this disparity in financing was due to the long-ranging effects of an economic depression in 1839, the reduced market price of cotton, and finally weakened European markets in the mid-1850s, due to the Crimean War.  These events depleted government resources in the South, creating this decline in government support of transportation infrastructure.  The reduced funding led to the work stoppages that hindered the completion of the Blue Ridge Railroad, and many other railroads in the South.  When the state had money to reinvest in railroads, the South was already technologically trailing the North by a decade or more.   The Civil War was approaching and the South didn't have enough time to complete the development of its railroads. If the South had more peace time to catch up with Northern technology, the Civil War could have played out very differently.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4164,"title":"Town Improvement Association of Winter Park\n","course_id":9,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-03-03","end_date":"1887-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The city of Winter Park was established in 1881 as a main trading center for fruit companies throughout Central  Florida.

Previously, people did not know the cause of cholera, but by the 1860s, public health officials suspected dirty water to be the source of the disease spreading and the new public sanitary measures reflected this. The Board of Health ordered that certain lots, some privately owned, be filled with dirt to prevent standing water from accumulating.  Also, the Board expected all householders to clean their property every day and their gutters at least twice a week.  Furthermore, all docks were to be cleaned and all accumulating shells, mud, filth and decaying wood were to be cleared every day so that no area had less than two feet of water at any time.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sam Houston to Mrs. Clay she found in his attire as \"he wore a leopard-skin vest, with a voluminous scarlet neck-tie, and over his bushy grey locks rested an immense sombrero... wrapped around his broad shoulders he wore a gaily coloured Mexican <em>serape</em>, in which scarlet predominated\" (98- 99). ","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).  As explained in <em>The Autobiography of Sam Houston,</em> \"It is of such violent contrasts that an epic figure is made\" (xv).  The diversity in the behavior of Sam Houston can not be separated.  Sam Houston the whittler is the same man as President Sam Houston.

The issue of this debate was participation in the Democratic Party National Convention at Baltimore, Maryland-where the party's Presidential nominee was to be decided.  The Baltimore Convention was the second such attempt; Democrats had met earlier from April 30th to May 3rd in Charleston, South Carolina for the same purpose.  There, the majority of the Lower South delegation (as well as a few from the Upper South) felt that the convention had grown hostile to their interests and had failed in its duty to protect the Constitutional right to slavery.  They cited as evidence the primacy of Stephen A. Douglas supporters at the convention and the establishment of a platform that ambiguously endorsed his idea of popular sovereignty for determining territorial slavery.   The disaffected delegates withdrew from the convention and set up their own caucus nearby.  From there, most \"bolters\" expected that they could negotiate their interests with greater leverage and, ultimately, rejoin the National Party.  However, the decision of the National Party Convention to adjourn from Charleston and reconvene on June 18th in Baltimore forced confrontation.  The decision made clear that the National Convention would not just submit to Southern demands.  Yet probably the move's most powerful, and inadvertent, impact was that it removed the breakaway delegation's ability to quietly conduct talks while maintaining overt separation.  Suddenly, Democrats from both the Upper and Lower South were under tremendous pressure to take a stand in what many deemed a choice between polar alternatives of submission or a genuine party split.","            It was in this context that the debate began between <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>and <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>, both Democratic newspapers that usually agreed with each other.  The issue of location proved to be particularly important in their debate, as one may infer from the fact that their cities' hosted two of the three conventions in question.  The <em>Enquirer's</em> native state of Virginia was largely the head of the Upper South states who, at the time, were still members of the National Convention.  Furthermore, though the <em>Enquirer</em> itself was not usually so ambivalent, Virginia had a history of behavior that was at times unfaithful to the Deep South platform, especially in regards to slavery.  <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>, for its part, was a first-rate example of the South Carolinian persona-a zealous and unrepentant champion of slavery and the South; it was not afraid to say \"secession.\"","            The debate began in a May 10th article from the Charleston Mercury challenging <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>.  The <em>Mercury</em> wrote that the <em>Enquirer </em>should have rebuked their delegates for not withdrawing, and further criticized the <em>Enquirer's </em>proposal that the Richmond Convention should wait to act until after the Baltimore Convention.  The <em>Mercury</em> ridiculed this idea that would leave delegates with nothing to do but \"suck their fingers.\" On May 18th, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>had much to say in response.  First, it said that Virginia wanted to participate in the Richmond Convention, but that as it was, they and other likeminded states wouldn't be able to nominate delegates in time.  Next, the <em>Enquirer</em> said that the Southern delegates should participate in the Baltimore Convention.  It said that the temporary fracture of the party was likely enough to restore a majority that was supportive of Southern interests. At last, the <em>Enquirer</em> argued that the obdurate pursuance of the Richmond Convention's current course was not only dangerous to the Union, but also to the unity of border slave states with the Deep South.","            <em>The Charleston Mercury</em> rejoined with what would be the final words on the matter.  Immediately, the <em>Mercury</em> challenged the idea that other Southern states wouldn't have time to join.  Also, to the suggestion that the National Party would change its position, <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>replied that, \"the <em>Enquirer </em>may dismiss from its patriotic anxieties all such romantic anticipations.\"  Finally, the <em>Mercury</em> laid great emphasis on the discussion of Southern unity.  The <em>Mercury</em> defended sole participation in the Richmond Convention as better securing the interests of the South.  At the Baltimore Convention, some Southern delegates would invariably be tempted to compromise Southern interests and side with the Northern Democrats.   This claim, along with <em>The</em> <em>Richmond Enquirer's </em>final thoughts, penetrated the core of the debate, a struggle between identification foremost as a citizen of the South or of the Union-in a political climate wherein it seemed that one of them was bound to be overthrown."],"display_date":"May 10, 1860 - May 23, 1860","search_date":"1860-05-16","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4232,"title":"Alexander Rives Asks James Madison for Advice about Nullification and Secession\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-28","end_date":"1833-01-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the early 1830s two of the most pressing questions in the nation were the issues of nullification and secession. A common trend among politicians was to use the ideas of the founders to argue both for and against these ideas, hence it is not surprising that on December 28, 1832 Alexander Rives, a Virginia lawyer, wrote to James Madison, one of the last surviving Founding Fathers, seeking council on this issue. Rives and Madison had never met, but Rives felt the matter so pressing that he forewent the usual formalities apologizing for his forwardness and the disruption of Madison's retirement. Of greatest concern to Rives was the fact that secessionists often referred to the writings of Madison in defense of their position, particularly the Virginia Resolution of 1798. Rives thought this to be a misinterpretation and hoped to be able to, \"Lay before my acquaintances some public evidence of what I conceive a fatal and insidious error,\" and thereby prove that Madison's writing did not endorse secession."," The main conflict arose due to Madison's argument in his Virginia Resolution that ultimate authority lay within the state and not the national government. Madison had always been a champion of the union, but political turmoil near the turn of the century caused him to endorse ideas that were more states rights oriented. The Virginia Resolution was a response to the Alien and Sedition Acts which Madison found to be extremely unpalatable and in direct conflict with the Constitution. He argued that in such cases states were obliged to nullify these laws for they were so unconstitutional that they threatened the rights of the citizens in those states. As Kevin Gutzman explains, \"Madison's document asserted that the state had a 'duty' to maintain its 'rights and liberties' within its boundaries.\" But Madison made clear that such actions were not to be taken without careful deliberation and only when the government overstepped the powers granted to it by the Constitution."," Rives believed that these words did not grant the states the power to arbitrarily secede nor did he believe that this was Madison's intention. He stated, \"That the opinions of the chief architect of our political systems should not be misconstrued or perverted to sinister purposes.\" Rives hoped that Madison could clarify his intentions and in doing so dissuade any improper use of his ideas.","In his response Madison agreed with Rives sentiments. He stated that, \"I do not consider the proceedings of Virginia in '98-99 as countenancing the doctrine that a State may <em>at will</em> secede from its constitutional compact with other states.\" The grievances of 1832, Madison felt, were not dire enough to constitute secession. Moreover, Madison argued that secession required the consent of the other states and not simply the whim of a single state. This confirmation made Rives's interpretation all the more legitimate in the eyes of the people this time. Thus, Rives letter to Madison portrays a desire of the people of the 1830s to qualify their political actions with the intentions of the founders who still held great authority in the people's minds."],"display_date":"December 28, 1832 - January 12, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-04","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4241,"title":"Chicago Prepares for Lincoln&#39;s Remains\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-30","end_date":"1865-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            April 30, 1865, was a busy yet solemn day for the residents and city officials of Chicago.

The article explains that the reasoning behind the author in the <em>News</em> editorial was that the \"'more intelligent and reasonable citizens must rule'\" no matter whether they are the majority or not and that suppressing the Negro vote was the only way to ensure this. The problem the <em>News</em> editorial author saw was that the current method of violence and intimidation seemed to violate the law and went against the sentiments of many people both in the state of South Carolina and outside it. Moreover, the current method was inconsistent in its effects, whereas an indoctrinated system would be much more systematized and effective. ","The concepts expressed in the News article were a precursor to future action by southern states. In 1890 Mississippi enacted laws such as literacy tests as a method of \"legal\" disenfranchisement, and as the <em>News</em> article predicted these laws worked amazingly well. They were so effective, in fact, that by 1900 all but four southern states had enacted some form of literacy tests and in those states that had them the black vote was all but extinct. The reason these literacy tests worked so well on the black population was that most slaves had never been taught to read or write and only some progress had been made in educating them after Emancipation. ","The successful imposition of these literacy tests was due in part to the fact that there was wide support for them across the country. The author of the New York Times article, in fact, voiced his support for literacy tests as \"a simple and natural method by which a community can protect itself against serious abuse and dangers.\" The problem the author saw was that these laws would not be administered equally or impartially and were simply a tool for suppressing the black vote. Under this premise \"an educational test becomes merely an instrumentality of wrong and fraud\" and so cannot be tolerated because it interferes with the democratic process. ","One must conclude in reading this article that Northern politicians were well aware of Southern intentions to disenfranchise blacks using legal tools long before they were ever able to enact them. The question is why did they let them? Part of the reason lies in the fact that the Democratic Party returned to national dominance in the mid 1880s and undid much of the Reconstruction legislation meant to ensure black rights. But Richard Valelly in his book <em>The Two Reconstructions</em> argues that it was also the fact that the Republican Party lost interest in the black community as a political group. As he states, \"The enormous and rapid growth of the Republican Party in the late 1890s outside the South substituted for lost black voters at the margin.\" So despite the fact that Republicans in the North knew that Southerners sought legal means to disenfranchise blacks they lacked the legal power and political interest to do anything about it."],"display_date":"February 7, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-07","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4262,"title":"The Centennial &#40;un&#41;Celebration\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-07-04","end_date":"1876-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["July 4, 1876 should have been a day of extraordinary celebration throughout the nation as the United States of America's Centennial birthday.

","Perhaps Southerners felt as if they had nothing to celebrate.  Divisions were hidden away, simmering just below the surface in honor of the occasion.  Republicans feared that every Southern Democrat was a traitor. Southern Democrats feared that every Republican wanted to remake the South in a subservient Northern model.  Some Southerners were still without full political rights and James G. Blaine aggravated the problem by proposing Jefferson Davis' exclusion from the Amnesty Bill.  The Civil War had not put an end to racial conflicts, especially in the South.  While the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan fought openly and violently against all efforts toward racial integration, the Union League pushed newly freed slaves and other blacks into political office, employing black militias for protection.  Southerners felt as if they were losing independence, order, equality, and freedom.","In sharp contrast, the North had just won a war, and black slaves had finally received their hard-earned freedom.  By 1876, the United States proved it would last as a nation, despite the Civil War.

Scholar John Gladstone claimed that \"the grand Centennial Exposition of 1876 [in Philadelphia] managed to divert the attention of the country away from the 'moral collapse in business and government.'\"  Other Northern celebrations were devoted to industrial progress, education, and humanitarianism, to show the greatness of America's becoming.  For newly liberated blacks, the Centennial provided the first opportunity to prove to the nation their extreme importance in its formation.  They hoped that it would bring the races together by ending any frustration felt by Southerners who disliked abolition and rejected blacks as citizens.","In 1876, the South was still recovering from war wounds.  Unfortunately, new violent opposing factions arose, contributing to further deterioration of Southern social, economic, and political climates.

Under the command of Major Robert Anderson, the troops heard the signal and began to evacuate their garrison. Packing up provisions, ordnance, and the fort's United States flag, the soldiers left Moultrie permanently. Their destination was Fort Sumter.","    Tensions in Charleston were high, as city commanders, loyal to the state, organized militia and built batteries throughout the Charleston area aimed at Fort Moultrie. Despite these threatening troop movements and gun placements, Major Robert Anderson was under strict orders to show no hostility towards the rebels. However, likewise, he was also instructed to \"hold to the last extremity\" if attacked. Afraid of being overwhelmed by a land-based assault on Moultrie, Anderson had planned for weeks to abandon his position and relocate to Fort Sumter, which he believed was much more defensible installation.

The Commission focused on the details of Union soldier's imprisonment during their service. The soldiers gave testimony as to their experience as a prisoner of war. The compilation of accounts details the suffering and privations of different soldiers both commissioned and non-commissioned officers. ","            Private Joseph Grider was sworn in and examined in Virginia by the Commission. He detailed his survival from both the Libby and Danville Prisons operated by the Confederate States of America. The main discussion elaborated on the health of Private Grider and the conditions in which he was held. Grider detailed the rations allotted to himself and his fellow prisoners of war; the main storyline revolved around the bread ration, a staple in the diet of Civil War soldiers. The bread was rough with whole grains; when he was moved to Danville he received black bread made of cane seed. Grider discussed the deterioration of his health as a result of the food rations and inadequate housing. The prisoners suffered from diarrhea and other ailments. One other area of interest from Grider's testimony involves the severity of punishment enforced by the Confederate guards; during his stay at Danville seven men were shot for out the window. Other punishments involved the holding of men in chambers until they 'fouled on the floor.'","            Another testimony from Private Robert Morrison detailed the differences between Richmond, Pemberton, and Danville Confederate Prisons. Similar to Grider, he discussed the loss of personal items and the deprivation of clean and warm shelter during his early experiences in the prisons. The deprivation of healthy and clean food was another problem for Private Morrison. He noted the decline in his health as coinciding with his entrance into the prisoner of war encampments. Prior to his capture he did not have problems with diarrhea or fever; sickness did not take hold upon Morrison until he began eating the rations given to him by Confederate guards. Unlike Grider's testimony, Morrison detailed his final living quarters as warm, spacey with endless amounts of food and also access to a 'privy.' ","            The similarities between these two privates testimony is parallel when it comes to their experiences with food rationing. In many instances they expressed their opinion that it was contaminated or perhaps undercooked. Private Morrison stated, \"I got a chunk of corn bread daily...sometimes it was about half baked.\"  Dr. Joseph Jones, a witness in trial against Henry Wirz, 'formerly the commandant of the interior of the Confederate States military prison at Andersonville', shared this hypothesis stating, \"As far as my experience extends, no person who had been reared on wheat bread, and who was held in captivity for any length of time, could retain his health and escape either scurvy or diarrhea, if confined to the Confederate ration (issued to the soldier in the field and hospital) of unbolted corn meal and bacon.\" ","            Interestingly enough, Confederate law decreed that all prisoners should have access to the same privilege and food rations as the Confederate Soldiers; this act was acknowledged by General Robert E. Lee himself in a letter to a relative stating, \"The laws of the Confederate Congress and the orders of the War Department directed that the rations furnished prisoners of war should be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy, and that the hospitals for prisoners should be placed on the same footing as other Confederate States hospitals in all respects.\" Whether this was an act of forbearance or an act of compassion it is easy to see, Union soldier in Confederate prisons suffered through disease and desperation similarly. Although this was an act in effect, prisons in the South failed to comply with all its' standards and requirements. William Best Hesseltine pointed out that the closing of the summer of 1863 brought about the halt of a cartel in which prisoners from both sides of the war were exchanged; this halt increased the number of mouths to feed and also the growing debt of the Confederacy. Prisoners in southern camps suffered the consequences of this halt. Hesseltine remarked that the quality and quantity of rations for prisoners especially at Libby prison decreased markedly as the days passed by and yet the officers continued to enjoy luxuries such as apples, sugar, eggs, molasses, and corn."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4292,"title":"A Seemingly Normal Day for President James Garfield\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-02","end_date":"1881-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["1 Gearing up for the 4th of July President James Garfield's itinerary for the weekend is printed in the Washington Post this morning.

The President's train will depart from the Baltimore and Potomac Depot at 9:30 A.M. this morning. ","            Garfield was originally elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican from the state of Ohio.  He immediately distinguished himself as a very competent and likable person.  His tendency to try to please everyone helped him win the Republican Presidential nomination in 1880 but would eventually hinder him during his presidency.  ","            2 On the morning of July 2, 1881 President Garfield made his way to his executive train car in the Baltimore and Potomac Depot. On the way he was shot twice from behind by Charles J, Guiteau.  Garfield would later become ill from infection and eventually died two months later on September 19, 1881.  Garfield's Vice President, Chester A. Arthur, was sworn into office the next day.  Garfield had only been in office for four months before he was mortally wounded.  Only William Henry Harrison had a shorter term in office. "," 3Ironically the most lasting legacy of James Garfield is the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 which passed 3 years after his death.  The civil service reform movement capitalized on the assassination by a \"deranged office seeker\" by blaming the spoils system for Garfield's death.  The Pendleton Act has had a significant effect on the civil services in the United   States.  It forced presidents to make appointments based on merit instead of patronage.  This helped eliminate corrupt practices inherent in the spoils system and also made the civil services more efficient because the new appointments were better educated and more experienced.

The result was the needless deaths of thousands of men on both sides due to malnourishment, lack of medical care, and abuse by prison guards.  But one set of prisoners fared slightly better than the other.","In a documented 1876 interview, Dr. R. Randolph Stevenson spoke of a provision in the Confederate Constitution for captured Union soldiers. The provision says, \"and the rations furnished for prisoners of war shall be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished to enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy.\"  Union prisons did not uphold such guarantees.  Many Confederate prisoners were denied basic needs by a nation with all kinds of resources.  The Confederacy on the other hand even went so far as to sell valuable supplies in order to feed and care for captured Union soldiers.","Indeed, many surgeons commented on the poor health of returned rebel soldiers. Those diseased souls spoke of abuse and neglect at the hands of their captors.  It was not uncommon for prisoner trade barges to contain the bodies of dead and dying persons.  Some prisoners spoke of being placed in prisons where disease like Small Pox ran rampant and medical aid was denied. Such accounts were collected and published after the war by historians.  Such stories seem at odds with the fact that the Union had funds available to improve the health and well being of captured rebels.","The Confederacy, on the other hand, made sure it upheld its belief in equal treatment of captured soldiers.  When money became scarce within the Confederate prison system, cotton and tobacco were sold to provide additional funding. When disease began to ravage prisoners, Confederate officers tried to barter with Union commanders for medical supplies, only to be rebuffed.  Accounts of favorable treatment and hospitality by Confederate prisons came from men like Mr. John F. Frost of Folgers Company 19th Maine.","In some circumstances, Union soldiers were held prisoners inside hospitals, while Confederate troops were held in makeshift camps.  The unequal treatment of captured soldiers by the two sides stands in contrast to the readily accepted notion that Union soldiers were treated much worse than Confederate troops.  This is perhaps the belief because of northern propaganda like \"Report 67.\" A renamed Congressional report on Confederate prisons based on conditions of soldiers and not on testimonials of POWs.   However, the truth is eventually revealed, and the light shone on the misdeeds of others.

The President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Scott had an ambition to build a second transcontinental railroad, and even though he would never achieve this dream on Oct.  30 1873 talks began on a deal that would hand over the rights of the California and Texas Railway Company to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. For 10 days now rumors had been swarming about a merger but they were not confirmed by officials until yesterday.  They hope to come to an agreement that will benefit both parties equally. 2The Pennsylvania Railroad Company was in the height of its prosperity and a new and long awaited investment opportunity to build a second transcontinental railroad had just presented itself.  All of this was part of a railroad boom in the post-Civil War era that would come to be known as the \"age of the railway\" in American History.","            3Scott played an important role in the Civil War leading up to this time. He was appointed Assistant Secretary of War to oversee transportation in 1861.  He would later resign and then serve another term as a colonel for Major-General Hooker's forces in 1863.  Scott was able to lay the foundation for a wartime mobilization scheme that would eventually win the war.   He would later become Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in 1861 but act as president until he acquired the title in 1870.  Scott presided over the \"greatest period of expansion in the country's history.\"  Under his control the company became a major railroad trust that had many holdings all over the United   States.  These holdings even listed the Southern Security Railway Company which strived to connect Richmond and Atlanta with one continuous line.  This line would eventually create the I-85 corridor, relevant to the 21st century.","            2The growth of the railroads in the 19th century not only furthered American transportation for the time but also helped further the economy by creating tens of thousands of jobs for local and immigrant workers. State funding for railroads would quickly dry up as states demanded more and more control over the railroads that the railroad company's retained.  Regional tensions over where the second trans-continental railroad should be laid caused the dream to die at least for the time.  The railroad provided economic booms for local cities that had been previously unimportant but they also cause economic disasters on a national level.  The railway company's have even been blamed for some economic depressions such as the one in 1873, triggered by the failure of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.  Also the bankruptcy of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Companies contributed to the Panic of 1893.  \"Regardless the attitudes, railroads became the dominant form of transportation and a major business enterprise.\"  It is clear now in hindsight that due to the work of great industrialists like Thomas Scott the railroad ruled America for over 50 years after the Civil War, and it continues to serve a pivotal role in 21st century America as well."],"display_date":"October 13, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-13","locations":[{"id":11231,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4313,"title":"Ashtabula Bridge Disaster as told by J.E.

E. Burchell was traveling on the Pacific Express train headed toward Chicago during a heavy snow storm.  As the first engine, \"Socrates\" crossed the two hundred foot bridge, the iron trusses broke, causing the bridge to collapse. His eye-witness account describes the accident as the second engine and eleven cars were tipped into the creek seventy feet below and the wood and cast iron frame of the bridge twisted. He recalled, he heard cracking in the front of the car, \"then came a sickening oscillation and a sudden sinking, and I was thrown stunned from my seat. I heard the cracking, and splintering, and smashing around me.\" When the train reached the frozen creek at the bottom of the ravine, cars closest to the engine burst into flames. Burchell describes people attempting to escape the raging fire by smashing windows or crawling out of the shattered cars. He also witnessed several people die horrible deaths in the blaze, because they were unable to free themselves from the debris. Rescue efforts were abandoned when the strong wintery winds caused the fire to escalate. Passengers and crew on the train by J.E. Burchell's estimate was as many as two hundred fifty people.  Ninety-two people died due to injuries sustained from the crash or from the fire that plagued the wreck."," J. E. Burchell's account was published in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> on December 30, 1876, the day after the accident. The next day his story ran in the <em>New York Times. </em>Both of these newspapers were able to advertise the severity of the death rate and damage from the accident, because of the personal account of one of the survivors. The Ashtabula Bridge Disaster caused the public to wonder about the stability of the Railroad Companies and their constructional efforts to connect railway systems throughout the East Coast, and toward the West. <em>The New York Times</em> completed a follow up story at the request of their readers to address reasons why it had collapsed; \"the result of defects and errors made in designing, constructing, and erecting it; that a great defect, and one which appears in many parts of the structure, was the dependence of every member for its efficient action on the probability that all or nearly all the others would retain their positions.\" People were horrified that Railroad Companies, in hast of construction, neglected to administer safety codes or inspection. "," By the 1870s the American public was use to iron bridges collapsing, but the railroad was more of a public commodity, then in its earlier days. The more deaths caused by the railroad, the more people expected payment for their losses. Some railway companies sought to avoid having to pay the damages by sticking with wooden trusses, but the application of cast iron was cheap and easy to get then. The Ashtabula Disaster awakened the feeling of national shock. The reality that ninety- four people had died in the horrific accident and forty-three passengers of the Pacific Express were burnt beyond recognition became a catalyst for the government to eradicate these problems. In 1887 the Interstate Commerce Act was passed by Congress to ensure safer methods of construction. Ashtabula Bridge Disaster became one of the most publicized bridge collapses. The distress the event caused the public assisted in the shift of power from privately owned railroad companies to government sponsored corporations."],"display_date":"December 29, 1876","search_date":"1876-12-29","locations":[{"id":10019,"lat":41.707475015,"lng":-80.7485016298,"zoom":9,"place":"ASHTABULA, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4318,"title":"Women of Hocking Valley Become a Force for Miners Strike\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-10-25","end_date":"1884-10-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A wood engraved image of the Hocking Valley Miners' Strike was published on October 25, 1884 in <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>. It depicted four officers leading a miner through a large crowd of women.  In the picture some women held clubs that were raised in threatening positions, while the rest had faces that were contorted with rage.  Joseph Becker sketched this scene in Buchtel, a mining town in Hocking County, Ohio during the Hocking Valley Miners' Strike of 1884. Miners, women and men, from forty-eight mines in Hocking Valley arranged the strike in order to dispute high living costs and decreased wages.  The miners had hoped to expand their rights as a worker by means of peaceful demonstrations with the organized political support of the Knights of Labor.  Nine months later, the striking miners were unable to come to an agreed compromise with the mine operators and returned to the mines. "," The women of the Hocking Valley miners were a familiar image, which grabbed the publics' attention toward the miners' plight during the 1880s. Their struggle for economic balance and the stability of their employment could only be recognized, because of the image of working class mothers and wives engaged in a united front.  Hocking Valley Miners were not only assisted by the image of their fellow workers in <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, but became connected through the family oriented association of the Knights of Labor.  This association was a national working class group that tried to end \"industrial capitalism\" by incorporating new ways to oppose unjust industrial policies.  The Knights of Labor was the first organized labor group to successfully attempted to change basic working conditions for all workers despite race , gender, position, age, and regardless of their experience. This large union would eventually assist the Hocking Valley mining families through two strikes during the 1880s. "," One of the biggest issues during these strikes was the rivalry of appearing levels in working class. Miners had been hired as individual groups, led by a selected manager. Most of the time family members would form a \"family system of production\". The necessity of many hands versus the few, children and women were part of the company.  This unit method allowed miners to work at an individual pace, but work was limited by the price of coal per ton. With the advancement of technology and the change in safety, job description changed the way workers were viewed as employees.  The emergence of the change between manual labor and skilled labor created a strained working force in the mines.  Wages and restrictions limited workers by age, gender, and skill sets, rather than the longevity of their employment. Job description was not a common term until the Knights of Labor and other Mining groups created the unity of workers.  No longer would miners receive the benefit of selected associates, but an organized layer of employees, based on their skills or experience. "," The sketch of the miners' women in Hocking Valley is an image that fueled the miners' progress toward the creation of a company that would unite under the protection of the United Mine Workers of America in 1890.  The image relays the importance of the labor union to the worker as standardizing the work force.  The uniqueness of the Hocking Valley Miner's Strike is that the workers' struggle was a family action.  Women were used by the newspapers to express the unfair working conditions and the poor pay of the Hocking miners.  Due to the efforts of the mining families in Hocking Valley and publicized notice in newspapers, miners succeeded in obtaining stable wages and equal opportunities, but the creation of the mining unions created a clear definition in skilled workers, manual laborers, and family working units."],"display_date":"October 25, 1884","search_date":"1884-10-25","locations":[{"id":10289,"lat":39.4969744596,"lng":-82.4791535659,"zoom":10,"place":"HOCKING, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4321,"title":"No Wampum for this land\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-03","end_date":"1832-12-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    December of 1832 saw another sale of lands that were the rightful property of Cherokee and Creek Indians in Georgia.  The Native Americans of Georgia were forced from their homes and lands because the state government saw the land as being underused and mismanaged by the Indian tribes.  This act of selling Indian lands was known as the Georgia Land Lottery and in 1832 it again sold off native lands to white Georgia citizens.","    The land sales started in 1805 as a way for the state of Georgia to grant land to qualifying citizens, white males.  This was an effort to try and stimulate the states economy and settle lands that the government had little to no real control over because they were occupied by Native Americans.   The system of selling land in a lottery format was unique to Georgia.     In 1814 the land sales came to a dramatic event when Creek Indians resisted land sales.  The conflict was won by Andrew Jackson and land sales continued.  In 1829 gold was discovered on land sold in the lottery and a gold rush followed which made the 1832 sale more dramatic.","    Prior to the 1832 sale of lands, the Cherokee people filed and won a Supreme Court case which ruled that Cherokee lands could not be taken from the Natives and sold by the state of Georgia without compensation.  President Jackson who had fought the Creek over the Georgia land lottery decided to ignore the Supreme Court ruling and continue with the land sales in the state.","A December 1832 article in the Columbian Star newspaper calls the sales of land in Georgia the \"Gold Lottery.\"  In the years prior to this particular land sale, gold had been discovered on the Cherokee and Creek lands resulting in a gold fever that  Georgia was happy  to spin into state profit.  Unfortunately for the state, the profits from the land sales only covered the actual costs of selling the land and little to no profit was actually made.  In 1832 Georgia sold 40 acre parcels dubbed \"gold lands\" capitalizing on peoples gold frenzy but not guaranteeing the lands would contain gold.   The obvious result of the land sales in December of 1832 was the displacement of hundreds and thousands of Cherokee Indians and the creation of a greater refugee population in the state of Georgia.","    The state and federal government solved the growing refugee problem with one of the most infamous Indian relations acts in United States history, the Trail of Tears.

According to the New York Times in July of 1888, there was \"a vast army of men and women and a few children in New York engaged in making clothes.\" Historically, the clothes industry had undergone many tariff protections. For instance, all the parts of a woman's dress or a man's suit were \"protected\" by astronomical tariffs: on such items as \"raw wool, the cotton yarn, the print cloth, the thread, the buttons, linings, trimmings and woolen cloth.\" The article, \"Clothes Makers and the Tariff,\" argued for the Mill Bill, a bill that would allow for laborers to enjoy higher wages and, consequently, a better and cheaper standard of living. This piece of legislation hoped to encourage these positive alterations by making wool \"free,\" like cotton, which already enjoyed freedom from large duties. ","    In 1888, cotton's rate of duty was approximately 40 percent, compared to the 69 percent experienced by the wool industry. The New York Times discovered that this increase in duty did not benefit the wage earners. Instead, it merely added to the profits of the companies. Meanwhile, there were large numbers of people smuggling foreign goods into the country, which only further increased the problems instilled by the current duty. The Mill Bill hoped to take positive actions to \"excel\" in the worldwide clothing manufacturing market, a foreign idea in the \"cloth making business\" in the late 19th century. Instead, countries such as England dominated in these areas because of the United States' high duties. ","    The factories, which should have been filled with the \"music of contented labor,\" were instead filled with the miserable sounds of the \"poverty-stricken.\" The introduction of the Mill Bill would allow factories to become happier places, with lower costs to the manufacturer and lower costs of materials. With the reduction of duties as proposed by this bill, the United States and New York City would be able to compete with foreign competitors, have happier employees, and extend the clothing market. ","    The sentiments expressed through both this article and the Mill Bill were supported by the women and the Democrat Party's campaign throughout 1888 and 1892. Women worked in these clothing factories in an 11:1 ratio of females to males, and shopping and consumerism had continually become a female duty. The Democratic Party and the tariff reform movement involved both working-class women and middle-class women, whose voices strove to be heard through the ballots of their husbands. The Democratic Party employed moral arguments for economic reforms as Democratic women argued that these tariffs were stealing incomes from hard-working families, and they blamed the Republicans for this insanity. Through reforms such as the tariff reform, women gained their political voice as they marched their husbands to the ballot boxes. As reported by the Woman's Tribune, \"political parties [began] to take note of what will be women's wish.\" In the 1890 election, women's influence and the tariff issue seemed to dominate the Democrat's \"sweeping victories,\" as women gained political power through the ballots of their men and under the pretext of tariff reform and legislation, such as the Mill Bill.

Included in Manly's offenses was the prayer at Jefferson Davis' inauguration to the presidency of the confederacy in February 1861.  As part of a special group of ex-confederates who could not sign the typical oath of allegiance, Manly needed a Presidential pardon.  Individuals like Manly had to submit a petition to Andrew Johnson to be pardoned.  Following the petition, Manly had to obey five terms to become and remain a United States citizen.  First, he took the oath of allegiance as established by President Johnson on May 29, 1865.  Manly then had to pay any costs owed from any proceeding and disclaim property or proceeds from the sale of confiscated property.  He was instructed to notify the secretary of state to legitimize the pardon upon its arrival, and if Manly used slave labor of any kind in the future, the pardon would be void.  On October 19, 1865 Manly received two more official letters signed by Secretary of State William H. Seward: the first stated that he had taken the oath of loyalty, and the second professed the first letter was a valid copy of the letter Seward had on his file.  At age 67, just three years before his death, Manly Basil, Sr. was once again a citizen of the United States.","            At the end of the Civil War, Lincoln (and later Johnson) was faced with the task of reintegrating those who had participated in the rebellion against the United States.  Lincoln designed a plan that included an oath of allegiance readily available to the masses, but required leaders of the Confederacy to ask him for a pardon directly.  By not forcing anyone to take the oath, Lincoln encouraged a feeling of amnesty when the war ended.   After Lincoln's death Johnson adopted a similar plan, but included a greater number of people in the \"exceptions\" who must ask for presidential pardon.  Manly's role in establishing the confederacy meant that he fell within the fourteen categories of exceptions which included those rebels who had served in political office, held a high ranking military position, or owned property valued at over twenty thousand dollars.  With so many people requiring special consideration, there was a significant influx of petitions for pardon between July and October of 1865 from those who wanted to attend the upcoming state conventions.  Basil Manly's petition for pardon coincided with press reports claiming President Johnson was giving pardons more freely than before.  Lincoln's hope of rebuilding the nation by granting citizenship to large numbers of ex-confederates set up an interesting dichotomy.  While Radical Republicans grew increasingly angry at Johnson's laxness on those they saw as traitors, Southern Democrats slowly began fighting to reassume power in the South.  Instead of finding a unified nation, the two factions continued the struggle for power until after Reconstruction ended."],"display_date":"September 12, 1865 - October 19, 1865","search_date":"1865-09-30","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4339,"title":"Sanitary Reform in Wake of Epidemics\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-10-19","end_date":"1878-10-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"It is now eleven years since the fever was epidemic in Galveston, and the citizens believe that with proper attention to sanitary precautions they need never suffer again.\" Referring to an epidemic of the yellow fever in 1867, an article in the <em>Scientific American</em> used Galveston, Texas, as an example for sanitation standards when quarantining the yellow fever in 1878. The article continued to claim, \"the value of such sanitary care was particularly tested in 1878, when the disease was very fatal in Memphis, Shreveport, and in Texas.\" In the wake of numerous epidemics of yellow fever, cholera, and the like, people throughout the country called for sanitary reform and regulation.

In the early stages of urban development, city-dwellers practiced private-lot waste removal, in which, as Peterson describes, they \"discharged their wastes upon the land adjoining their dwellings and shops, principally within the confines of the private lot but also into the streets.\" In reaction to similar problems in England during the 1840s, British reformer Edwin Chadwick developed an innovative system of water-carriage sewerage, in which pressurized water was passed through small, egg-shaped pipes to carry solid wastes away from the city. Chadwick also accepted the filth theory, which held \"that gases or miasmas emanating from decaying organic matter caused disease.\" However, not much progress was made in sanitary reform in America before the Civil War; as Peterson remarks, \"only Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Chicago, in fact, attempted major works before the Civil War. Not until after the war and the return of cholera in 1866 did many cities introduce systematic sewerage.\" At that point, American pioneers followed Chadwick's suit, installing comprehensive and integrated sewer systems in major cities across the nation. Legislation was passed to provide for the administrative reform of sanitation. Boards of Health began cropping up in cities around the country. The American Public Health Association, which Peterson claims, \"became the principal voice of American sanitary reform,\" was formed in 1872. Sanitary survey planning emerged as a useful practice, as it \"required the study of every street, lot, and building in a city to determine the precise location of any prevalent and all suspect environmental conditions.\"     ","The impact of American sanitary reform was most readily observed in the comprehensive reconstruction plan developed for Memphis, Tennessee in response to a devastating yellow fever epidemic in 1878, which claimed 5,150 lives out of its population of approximately 45,000. A National Board of Health was created in March 1879 to deal with the problem. It conducted an exhaustive, citywide survey and made nine proposals to improve the city's sanitation. George E. Waring was chosen to construct an innovative and controversial sewage system in the city. According to the <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>, Waring's \"pipes were much smaller than customary, were for house sewage only, without manholes, well ventilated, and were flushed every twenty-four hours by means of automatic flush tanks.\" Although the plan only pertained to health matters and not to the city's future growth, the sanitary reform conducted in Memphis considerably improved the city's sanitation and proved to be a significant step towards the eventual practice of city planning. ","However, in the 1880s and 1890s, German and French bacteriologists soon discovered the microscopic pathogenic organisms responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera, among others. Peterson states, \"As this new public health approach gradually took hold, it shifted attention away from the root premise of sanitary reform - that most infectious disease had its source in the visible environment.\" Thus, preventative measures such as isolation, immunization, disinfection, and antitoxins became more important than sanitary reform. Sanitary scientists developed methods of filtration and chlorination of water, allowing polluted water to become purified. Although sanitary reform eventually lost momentum in the face of microorganisms and filtration, the movement sparked valuable innovations in sewerage and city planning as methods to control the byproducts of urbanization during the nineteenth century.

This conflict, however, arose between the Executive and Legislative branches. It is quite possible that only a man of Lincoln's strength could have succeeded in handling the Reconstruction crisis that led to the feud, and Johnson, his successor, was unfortunately not of the same cut. As will be seen, given the nature of the crisis, few people would. ","Generally speaking, Reconstruction is divided into several phases, with the distinction between two of them being Presidential and Congressional Reconstruction, both of which are self-explanatory regarding who was in charge. When Lincoln, the helmsman of the former phase, was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, took it upon himself to follow through with Lincoln's plan for an amicable and (especially) rapid restoration of the Union. Unfortunately for Johnson, the so-called \"Radical Republicans\" that controlled Congress at the time abhorred the Southern States' passage of Black Codes and attempted to slow their reentry into the Union as punishment. Johnson, of course, still had speed as his priority and refused to back these punitive measures. When Congress realized they would get no help from Johnson, they decided to take matters into their own hands and proposed the Freedman's Bureau Bill in late 1865. The Bureau itself had been a temporary entity founded by Lincoln immediately after the war with the intention of assisting the newly freed slaves. Under the Bill proposed by Congress, however, the Bureau's longevity and powers would be greatly increased. While this was ostensibly to give more and better aid to the slaves, it was by no means coincidental that the Bill's passage would transfer <em>de facto</em> control of Reconstruction from Johnson to Congress.  ","From Johnson's point of view, this was a dilemma in the fullest sense of the word: oppose the bill and gain enemies or allow it and lose power. He chose the former and vetoed the passage of the Bill in February of 1866. According to <u>The New York Times</u>, Johnson gave several reasons for this, although the largest one seemed to be that passage of the Bill did not put enough faith in the abilities of the Southern leaders to handle Reconstruction on their own. Furthermore, the article states that Johnson claimed to believe \"that the question of the Union is paramount to all others.\" Taken together, these statements reflect an attempt by Johnson to rally the nation behind him more than anything else. Specifically, in the latter statement he seems to be likening himself to Lincoln and trying to take advantage of the late Lincoln's popularity in the North, with the former statement obviously being an attempt to put him on the good side of the Southern leaders. In the end, this would not help him, as Congress passed the Bill over his veto and basically used their new powers to make life miserable for Johnson, who would go on to have the dubious honor of being the first US President to be impeached.  ","In Johnson's defense, it cannot be denied that Lincoln, a popular man-of-the-people even before he was martyred, would have been a tough act to follow.  In that regard, it is not surprising that Johnson would remain so adamant on his quest to follow through with Lincoln's plan, as to change said plan would have seemed disrespectful to Lincoln's memory and therefore political suicide. The true irony of the situation becomes apparent here, as it was not changing the plan that would turn out to be the real suicide. Specifically, Johnson's unwillingness to deviate from Lincoln's hope for a fast rebuilding-even in the face of the Black Codes-led to Congress trying to seize Reconstruction authority via the Freedman's Bureau Bill, which in turn led to the lose-lose position that Johnson occupied in February 1866."],"display_date":"February 20, 1866","search_date":"1866-02-20","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4361,"title":"Southern Opinion on the National Union Convention of 1866\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-07-11","end_date":"1866-07-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    \"The object of the convention is to sustain the President and reunite the country on his policy of Reconstruction.\" With this statement, the Wednesday, July 11, 1866 edition of the Montgomery Daily Advertiser outlined the purpose of the upcoming National Union Convention that was to take place on August 14, 1866. With the end of the war, the issue of reuniting the country was topic of both local and national interest. The prospect of joining the nation under a common ideology and purpose was one that was imperative to piecing together the broken nation. However, the fact that the country has just emerged from a long and arduous civil war entrenched in the ideas of varying ideologies made this repair a daunting task. Although Montgomery was located deep within the former Confederacy, the Advertiser's outlook of the upcoming convention was positive. The paper described an idyllic prospect, claiming a \"spectacle of men from the North and South mingling together in harmonious counsel will go a long way towards sustaining him [Andrew Johnson] and breaking down the power of those who are alike, enemies to him and to constitutional liberty.\"","    Upon the end of the Civil War, many people, both of northern and southern origins and loyalties, had become weary of the war. Families longed to be reunited and there was a hope for a return to a normal and stable way of life. As the Advertiser described, there was the hope that both Northerners and Southerners would be able to find common ground through support of Andrew Johnson, but, Johnson's blatant opposition to proposed legislation such as the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act made it unclear exactly how dedicated Johnson himself was to fully reuniting the nation. ","    Although there was a feeling among Americans that the country was in need of repair, there were many Southerners and delegates to the National Convention from Alabama and other former Confederate states who, \"though willing to concede defeat at the hands of the Union army...would not, as the unionists demanded, admit wrong doing in 1861.\" This failure to accept war guilt also extended into other facets of life as well. Many southern states refused to acknowledge the rights of blacks following the end of the war. Governments across the South instituted Black Codes to restrict the rights and lifestyles of African Americans, or simply tried their best to return freedmen to a status as close to slavery as possible. Highlighting this Southern attitude, it became obvious that the issue of rebuilding the nation and the policy of Reconstruction that soon ensued was not enough to the cause the South to forget the war and ideology that fueled it in the first place."],"display_date":"July 11, 1866","search_date":"1866-07-11","locations":[{"id":301,"lat":32.2488115675,"lng":-86.1666274124,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4661,"title":"A Defeat So Sweet","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-11-03","end_date":"1876-11-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 3, 1876 Rutherford B.

In these typically Republican states, votes were counted, thrown out, and bought, but the final results favored a flabbergasted Hayes. The final verdict was that Hayes had defeated Tilden by one electoral vote, even though the popular vote had favored Tilden by a narrow margin.

However, when the Ridge Party, a breakaway pro-removal group of the Cherokee Nation, signed the Treaty of New Echota with U.S. treaty commissioners J.F. Schermerhorn and William Carroll on December 29, 1835, tensions mounted from within the Cherokee Nation as well as from without.  John Ross, the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, vehemently opposed the New Echota Treaty and the Ridge Party (also known as the Treaty Party), and on October 8, 1836 <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Niles' Weekly Register</em> printed an article advocating Ross's views.  Through excerpts from correspondences and appeals to the U.S. government, Ross argued that by signing the New Echota Treaty, the Treaty Party leaders - Major Ridge, his son John Ridge and nephew Elias Boudinot - contradicted the wishes of the \"Cherokee people [who], in two protests, the one signed by twelve thousand seven hundred and fourteen persons, and the other by three thousand two hundred and fifty persons, spoke for themselves against the treaty\" and condemned the some twenty-one thousand Southeastern Cherokees to \"a far inferior right of occupancy to that which they have ever been admitted to possess where they now are, and where they were born,\" namely their ancestral lands.","Though this was not the first time the Cherokee Nation clashed on matters of national interests, it marked the first time that action had been taken by a minority group under the guise of representing the entire Nation.  As notable American Indian historians Theda Perdue and Michael D. Green have observed, while there had been considerable changes in the Cherokee government and organization as a cohesive Nation, \"Cherokees still believed that leaders should represent a consensus.\"  Not only did the Ridges and Boudinot <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">not</em> represent the majority opinion of the Cherokees, but by trying to usurp power from Ross they severed themselves completely from the Nation's identity and simultaneously bound the Cherokee to an almost unfathomable future.  Many Cherokee realized that with their forced relocation west of the Mississippi River the Nation's relationship with the United States would be forever changed, as Ross claimed.  Even more did not even accept the Treaty as true; after all, how could such a document speak for the entire Nation which had rejected similar compromises twice prior to the New Echota Treaty?  Indeed, it was not until General Winfield Scott arrived during the summer of 1838 that the Cherokees' fate was clear and the Ridge Party's misrepresentation of the Cherokee Nation became an almost insurmountable barrier between the Nation and that vocal minority."],"display_date":"December 29, 1835 - December 31, 1838","search_date":"1837-06-30","locations":[{"id":2390,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4622,"title":"George Boutwell Fights for Black Rights in D.C.","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-18","end_date":"1866-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":null,"display_date":"January 18, 1866","search_date":"1866-01-18","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4427,"title":"Transportation of US Mail Between Baltimore and Philadelphia\n","course_id":17,"status":"P","start_date":"1825-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On January 29th, 1825, Postmaster General John McLean wrote a letter to Henry Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives, explaining the horrible traveling conditions that had to be endured to carry the mail between Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  McLean discussed the horrendous traveling circumstances during the winter and spring seasons when crossing the different rivers and traveling over roads.  Some rivers could use steamboats, but the steamboats could not run when the rivers were full of ice.  Other rivers did not have steamboats because the rivers were too shallow, such as the North East, Big Elk, and Little Elk rivers.  The carriages transporting mail had to travel across the rivers at their shallowest points.  McLean reported that on one occasion a horse drowned, and several times the mail almost fell into the water.  McLean proposed that bridges be built over the North East, Big Elk, and Little Elk rivers to improve the quality of travel when delivering mail.  McLean also discussed the atrocious state of the roads that connected the different rivers.  The only turnpike that the mail carriers could use was the Baltimore and Havre de Grace Turnpike; the rest of the way was made up of poorly designed roads.  McLean asked whether better quality roads could be built and kept in good condition throughout the year.","John McLean was appointed postmaster general during the administration of James Monroe and continued his position into the John Quincy Adams administration.  McLean also had a close relationship with Henry Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives.  Clay supported a bill called the Bonus Bill that would have called for a national system of internal improvements to roads.  The bill was passed by Congress in 1817, but it was vetoed by President James Madison.  Then in 1822, Monroe vetoed a similar bill that called for tolls to be used to collect money to help pay for internal improvements, which he deemed unconstitutional.  When McLean wrote his letter to Clay, Congress had already been debating for years whether or not the federal government should build post roads, for use by the post office.  These roads would be built by the federal government, and Congress would have the duty of upkeep and maintenance of the roads. ","In the early nineteenth century, states started to build turnpikes all over the United States.  This craze lasted until about 1825, when states started to cut back on their turnpike building; this was also the year that McLean wrote his letter.  Since states had mainly spent their time and money building turnpikes, smaller roads that needed to be built never got the chance, or if they were built, they were neglected.","Many states also focused on canal building, which left large numbers of small rives with no access across them.  Pennsylvania's rugged terrain made it very challenging to build canal successfully.  The state built canals much later than many of its neighbors.  It was hard to travel on canals when they were filled with ice, which meant that people had to find other means of transportation.  Building bridges over rivers was a solution to the problem because most bridges could be used at all times of the year.  ","McLean's letter discuses the debate during this period over who was responsible for building and maintains of canals, bridges, and roads in the United States.  Clay was a supporter of the federal government's helping with the building and maintenance of canals, bridges, and roads because states were not able to keep up with ever growing demands of transportation.  Others though, felt that the federal government should not be involved.  McLean's letter pointed out that states did not have the funds necessary to build and maintain different types of transportation all at the same time.  The only way that states could keep up with the demands of the times was if the federal government was willing to help with such ambitious internal improvements."],"display_date":1825,"search_date":"1825-07-02","locations":[{"id":5928,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4430,"title":"A New Home for Sex in New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-07-11","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 19th century America, many men enjoyed the services of prostitutes but disliked prostitution.  This ironic dichotomy was very evident amongst the upper class men of New Orleans, and it heavily influenced the future landscape of the city.  With a 'not in my backyard' view of prostitution, the wealthy males of New Orleans, although many were clients of prostitutes, did not want their homes and families near the lewd activities of the prostitution business.","The <em>Mascot</em>, a Louisiana newspaper, highlighted the effects of prostitution on the community, echoing the opinions of some New Orleanians.  The July 11, 1892 edition of the paper portrays the population's general fear of bordellos, depicting a family outside of their home, parents shielding the eyes of their children from the sight of the bordello next door.  With prostitution so prevalent, many did not want their families exposed to it.  Also, the wealthy citizens viewed nearby prostitution as a detriment not only to their families, but also their financial assets.  With prostitution in the neighborhood, residential property values dropped, causing a real concern for New Orleans' wealthy.","So, rather than trying to eliminate prostitution, the wealthy male political leaders instead accepted that, according to Louisiana historian Alecia Long, \"sins of the flesh were inevitable\" and \"gave [Satan] his own address.\"  The municipal government's first attempt to reduce areas of prostitution was with the Lorette Ordinances of 1857.  But, by 1897, many citizens, interested in preserving both the moral and property values of their neighborhoods, advocated for the gathering of the city's prostitutes into a more specific, much smaller district: Storyville.  The Story Ordinances turned a predominantly poor, African American part of town, away from the upper class neighborhoods, into the new home of sex.","The location of the official district of prostitution in 1897 truly revealed the magnitude of racial superiority and economic self-interest in New Orleans.  The impoverished African Americans of Storyville were a powerless group in the social hierarchy of power in New   Orleans.  Protesting the vice district's zoning was simply not an option as blacks in the city had no voice in politics.  But, local leaders often defended the Story Ordinances, citing that only one church and one school were within the new, smaller district, even though the church and school were predominantly black.  This action from the political leaders, Long implies, perpetuated a message that African Americans shared the same social status as prostitutes, \"both conceptually and in terms of physical proximity.\" Seeing blacks as immoral sexual beings was not an uncommon view in 19th century culture."],"display_date":"July 11, 1892 - December 31, 1897","search_date":"1895-04-06","locations":[{"id":5602,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4446,"title":"<em>Governor Claiborne Remembered 23 Years After Death...</em>\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-20","end_date":"1840-08-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["        All the earth stood silent on December 20, 1803, as the Mississippi territorial governor rode in on the streets of New Orleans. Beautiful women adorned the balconies that hung over the Place d' Armes. Each country, represented by its own amount of officials and military, watched as the France flag descended and the American flag ascended succinctly down the pole, meeting halfway to acknowledge exchange of powers. President Thomas Jefferson instructed William Claiborne, Mississippi's current territorial governor at the time and General Wilkinson, commander of the United States Western Army to receive Louisiana from France, who just received it from Spain within the same year. The transaction happened in a time frame of less than 20 days. With the documents signed making the Louisiana Purchase official, Governor Claiborne made a speech to the inhabitants that promised their way of life would not be disturbed. The United States received the \"keys\" to the city and thus the elected William C.C. Claiborne began to act as governor of the territory of Louisiana.","            The Portrait of Governor Claiborne was painted in 1840, 23 years after his death. It is probable that E.B. Savary chose to paint the Governor at a time where New Orleans had a growing population. According to U.S. Bureau of the Census for Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places, New Orleans was the third largest city in 1840 with a population of 102,193 persons. Aside from the rise of popularization of New Orleans, many Louisianans favored Claiborne due to his passiveness in government. Many considered Claiborne qualified for governor because he had served as assistant to a Congress clerk, opened a law firm, appointed as a Tennessee Supreme Court Judge, and selected by President Thomas Jefferson to preside as Mississippi territorial governor. From the very beginning Claiborne sought to appease the people of New Orleans. He adopted their style, delayed the necessary revisions to the laws, and appointed locals to the political office.  This led to a number of critics including that of Andrew Jackson, major General of U.S. forces. In his opinion, he thought of Claiborne as \"much better qualified for great pomp and show, and courting popularity-quiet life- in civil walks- than military achievements amidst peril danger\". Vincent Nolte, a local German-born merchant described Claiborne as \"a weak, intriguing, and gutless man who had not the energy necessary to give a great impulse to the population of Louisiana and cared only for his popularity and preeminence\". Claiborne resented Jackson upon his arrival into New Orleans because now he would be forced to take orders from a man whom had absolute authority and Claiborne considered Jackson to be inferior. ","            According to the painting, one would assume that Governor Claiborne symbolized a man with great military strength, but on the contrary he was not known for fighting battles. Perhaps the military uniform shown speaks of Claiborne's desired image to be taken seriously, but his smirk in the portrait speaks volumes of how the governor was gullible. Although Governor Claiborne aided the U.S. military with war supplies during the Battle of New Orleans, he did not directly win its victory. Despite his shortcomings on the battlefield, Claiborne is remembered for his numerous contributions in advancing Louisiana such as building new roads, establishing a mail service, and developing a public educational system. After serving as Governor of Louisiana he was elected into the U.S. Senate, but died before ever taking office.

As a result, in the second session of the 30th Congress on March 3, 1849, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the \"Act to establish the Home Department, and to provide for the Treasury Department an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.\"  Amongst the numerous duties allocated to the Secretary of the Interior, such as the supervision of the General Land Office, the distribution of the decennial national census, and the organization of U.S. metal mines, the act notably assigned \"the supervisory and appellate powers now exercised by the Secretary of the War Department, in relation to all the acts of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\" to the new Secretary of the Interior as well.","Judging by appearances, the Department of the Interior as outlined in the 1849 act seemed like more of a depository of offices from other executive departments with which they had little to do anymore, as the first Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing noted in his 1849 report.  Nevertheless, the act highlighted an important transition in the U.S. federal government's attitude towards Indians, most of whom had been removed to west of the Mississippi River a decade prior if not earlier.  In fact, prior to this statute the Commissioner of Indian Affairs operated under the supervisory powers of the Secretary of War, clearly indicating the combative attitude that was presumed necessary when interacting with any Indian tribe.  However, by 1849 the \"Indian problem\" that had struck fear in so many Americans' hearts during the thirty years earlier now appeared relatively innocuous; indeed, as prominent American Indian historian Wilcomb E. Washburn observed, with the immense tracts of land that Mexico surrendered in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo \"the duties performed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs were bound to increase\" but they were to be \"more oriented to peaceful pursuits than to warlike ones.\"  The preceding rationale - which was originally espoused by Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker in 1848 - effectively encouraged white Americans to turn their eyes toward 'civilizing' the Indian by introducing an agriculturally-based lifestyle which would eventually aid white expansion onto Indian grounds across the Southwest and the Plain States.  Thus, as white America continued its march westward under the guise of Manifest Destiny, the American Indian began to be perceived as less of a military threat and more of land resource to be manipulated."],"display_date":"March 3, 1849","search_date":"1849-03-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4476,"title":"Reforming &quot;The Bend&quot;","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Where Mulberry Street crooks like an elbow within hail of the old depravity of the Five Points, is \"the Bend,\" foul core of New York's slums.\" These words, written by Jacob A. Riis in his groundbreaking 1890 work, <em>How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York,</em> describe a desolate corner of the urban decay that characterized New York's Lower East Side in the late 1800s. Riis, a Danish immigrant who came to New York in 1870, used cutting edge flash photography to illustrate the depraved conditions of the city and quickly gained notoriety as one of the leading \"muckrakers;\" a name referring to group of reformers who used journalism to lead the way in exposing social problems and the call for reform.","One of the chapters in the book focuses on the conditions of Mulberry Bend just north of the Five Points, which Riis illustrates with a photograph showing the chaotic look of the street on a typical day. Riis describes in detail how street crime and gangs prevailed in \"the Bend\" over the local law enforcement and how the death rate was extremely high within the area, which was fifty percent higher than the rest of the city. Especially tragic was the death rate for children under five, which was significantly higher than all other areas. Central to the problem facing Riis at this time was a way to solve the issues of urban decay and the slums in a way which would go beyond the limitations of philanthropy but without advocating a socialist doctrine, which would be condemned by those in power. Beginning in 1888 and continuing into the 1890s Riis began giving lectures that incorporated photographs of the conditions of \"the Bend\" to philanthropic groups and the general public, which supplemented his journalistic newspaper writing to help spread awareness about the slum problem.","In 1888 the Tenement House Committee of New York had drawn up plans for Mulberry Park in the block between Bayard, Park, Baxter, and Mulberry streets, which made up the area known as \"the Bend.\" It would take six more years until the property was bought for the park. The major reason for the slow action by the committee stems from the hesitancy of city officials to mettle in the affairs of the landlords of tenements in the most need of change. It was the release of Riis's book and the public outcry that accompanied it that finally helped to push the city toward purchasing the land and building the park. On December 21, 1893 Riis offered a solution to the unemployment of the city in the New York <em>Evening Sun </em>in which he called for the use of public funds to hire workers to demolish the depraved buildings that made up \"the Bend.\" Even after the land was purchased and the buildings were demolished in 1895 the area remained barren until 1897 when the park opened. It was only due to increased pressure from Riis and other reformers that the park within the urban slum could be finally realized. Possibly the greatest irony involved in the creation of the park came at its dedication on June 15, 1897; a ceremony in which Riis was not invited to attend."],"display_date":"1888 - 1897","search_date":"1892-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4613,"title":"Andrew Johnson Provokes the Radical Republicans","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1867-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Johnson was impeached for violating a number of laws, but was acquitted. He attempted to accomplish a number of things while trying to get former Confederate states back into the Union, but he did so in an improper manner. In 1868 the House of Representatives brought Andrew Johnson on trial for violating the Tenure of Office Act. According to <em>The New York Times</em> article, \"The President's Future Course<em>,</em>\"<em> </em>\"The recent removal of Mr. Stanton, and the appointment of Gen. Thomas Secretary ad interim, in violation of the Tenure of Office Law, will that case constitute the sole offence for which he is to be tried.\"  The Tenure of Office Law was enacted on March 2, 1867; it denies the President of the United States the power to remove anybody from office who was appointed to said office by the President and the Senate, unless both the President and the Senate approve. In Johnson's removal of Stanton from the office of Secretary of the Department of War, and the appointment of Brevet Major-General Lorenzo Thomas to that position, he violated the Tenure of Office Act. Johnson's attorney argued that Johnson did not violate the law because Stanton was appointed during Lincoln's presidential term. In 1868 the House of Representatives passed the articles of impeachment and then the Senate tried him for violating the Tenure of Office Act. Andrew Johnson was the first President to be impeached.","Two-term President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865. Andrew Johnson succeeded to the presidency rising from the Vice-Presidential position. Johnson had been nominated under controversy as radicals and moderates within the Republican Party were already living with tension. Johnson had taken a hard approach with rebels in Tennessee, he hated the planter class and agreed with a soft peace, but he also had a lot of southern pride. Tensions within the party rose when he vetoed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave equal rights to former slaves. Radical Republicans were elected in 1866 to hold the majority in Congress, and in doing so the Republican Congress wrested control away from Johnson. He had done a number of things to separate himself from the Republican Party including supporting the Black Codes in southern states. From this point on Johnson did very little as President as Congress took control and Johnson never fought to take back control. Foner quoted the Supreme Court Justice David Davis as saying that Johnson was, \"'obstinate, self-willed, combative,' and totally unfit for the office.\" Historian Eric Foner also states that it was not in the best interest of the Republican Party to impeach Johnson because the successor would be Ben Wade, as president of the Senate, who had very radical ideas on reconstruction."],"display_date":"1865 - 1867","search_date":"1866-07-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":183,"tag":"Constitution"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4693,"title":"Interview with Robert M.

Bayless declared that \"out there in these little towns like this, I think that mainly it was just a little bit of horn honking and maybe going to an extra movie or something like that, but there was really no wild celebrations. Lubbock had a small welcome home for the 5,420 veterans that returned from the war. However, Bayless recalled that \"every time anyone mentioned something about, well, now all our boys are gonna be coming home, they would always say, 'Gee, it's great.

Abernathy claimed, “We are not trying to impress anybody with our strength; we just plan to demonstrate to the people who do not have cars that we are willing to walk with them”","As the African Americans waited for the church meeting to start they sang, picking up the hymns that came to mind.  When the leaders appeared at the rear of the church the audience stood and cheered.   At the Baptist Church Martin Luther King Jr., head of the Montgomery Improvement Association, told the gathering that the protest was not against a single incident but over things that “Go deep down into the archives of history, this is not war between the Whites and the African Americans but a conflict between justice and injustice.”  Dr. King went on to say “We must use the weapon of love.  We must have compassion and understanding for those who hate us”","On June 4, 1956 the federal district court ruled that Alabama’s racial segregation laws for buses were unconstitutional.  The boycott continued until, finally on November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the district court’s ruling.  This victory led to a city regulation that allowed African American bus passengers to sit anywhere they wanted, and the boycott officially ended December 20, 1956.

Or at least one of his 12 original Constitutional amendments had been resuscitated. With near unanimity (Senate: 99-0; House: 414-3) Congress showed its support for the Twenty-Seventh Amendment on May 20,1992. The Amendment prohibits adjustments to Congressional salaries from taking effect before an election intercedes. Yet the vote was largely meaningless, as earlier in the month Michigan had become the thirty-eighth state to ratify the proposal – thus giving it the three-quarters proportion needed to amend the Constitution. Six states originally ratified the proposal between 1789 and 1791; Ohio became the seventh in 1873. Only one other state (Wyoming, in 1978) would endorse it before a legislative aide in Texas named Gregory Watson stumbled across the amendment in 1982 and initiated a campaign for its revival. By 1988, a total of 25 states had ratified Madison's motion.","But had the 203 years between its proposal and ultimate adoption rendered the earliest states' approval invalid? No, according to Don Wilson, Archivist of the United States, who certified the Amendment's validity six days prior to the vote in Congress. (It has become practice recently for proposals to contain a sunset clause – typically seven years – but this was not the case with Madison's amendments.) And thus it became law. Although why – after having lain dormant for two centuries – should this proposal suddenly take on such importance?","There is a theory as to how “structural” amendments such as the Twenty-Seventh arise. An event triggers widespread awareness of a problem with how government works. In response, a coalition forms that amends the Constitution to resolve the problem. In 1989, Congress implemented pay raises that saw Senate salaries increase 14 percent – and House salaries go up 40 percent – by 1991. Over this same time frame, public confidence in Congress fell significantly. There was little public appetite for Congressional pay increases in the face of growing perceptions of arrogance and allegations of corruption against some members of Congress. It is no surprise then that the elections of 1990 and 1992 revealed strong anti-incumbent sentiments amongst the electorate. Combined with Watson's drive, this led 15 states (including the linchpin, Michigan) to endorse the resolution between 1989 and 1992, as a means of restoring some legitimacy to the governing institutions in the public’s eye. It is also why when Congress backed the resolution on May 20 – given it had no legal impact – the vote was seen as largely political.","The Twenty-Seventh Amendment has been described as amendment by “stealth,” given the lengthy delay between proposal and ratification. Nevertheless, it is an example of the tradition of using the constitution to correct a structural problem of government, one even the Founding Fathers recognized as an issue. “James Madison saw something wrong with members of Congress increasing their own salaries, unchecked by their constituencies...

On October 19, 1932, Second Lieutenant Ralph Hurst wrote to his commanding officer Brigadier General J.C. Parsons about the “Communist Agitation” in Birmingham. The International Labor Defense had recently moved its Southern headquarters to Birmingham and there had been trouble ever since. According to Hurst, the police had originally arrested communist agents and disbanded their meetings. During one of their raids, they found correspondence that indicating that the communists in Birmingham had been “instructed to concentrate on Negroes in the South.” The communist agents had held two meetings that Blacks and Whites attended.  According to Hurst, Communists advocated social and political equality between the races and adopted resolutions calling for “abolition of poll taxes, enfranchisement of every resident without respect to color or other qualifications” and urged both black and white families to go out and take what they needed. Communists also took aim at capitalists who “exploited whites against blacks and vice versa.” The infamous Ku Klux Klan broke up the second of these meetings with “malodorous bombs” and announced that “The Klan Rides Again” and would “stamp out” communism. Hurst concluded his letter by telling Parsons that the communists were “playing a shrewd game of capitalizing on unemployment and adverse conditions” to gain supporters. He warned that unless relief facilities are sent “there is a likelihood of some disorders and attendant violence.”","Hurst proved to be correct. Anti-communist violence began to increase around this period and lasted until the end of the decade. Historian Robin Kelley attributes the rise in violence to the fact that communists promoted equality between the races. According to Kelley, anti-communists used racism to fight against and hinder the communist cause. White-supremacy groups, like the Ku Klux Klan and White Legion, and racist politicians played on the Southern fears of racial equality to ostracize communists. Another historian, Robert Ingalls takes a different perspective on the issue. Ingalls believes that the most important factor in anti-communist violence was the big businesses that economically dominated Birmingham. Ingalls focuses on the Tennessee Iron, Coal and Railroad Company (TCI). By the end of the 1930s, the La Follette Senate Committee found enough evidence to show that TCI had been sponsoring violence against communists. For Ingalls, the real cause of the violence was “establishment attitudes towards labor” that kept the elite in power. From Hurst’s letter, it seems that both factors, racism and big business capitalism, were at work to limit the communists’ acceptance in Birmingham."," "],"display_date":"October 19, 1932","search_date":"1932-10-19","locations":[{"id":24062,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5219,"title":"United Textile Workers Ready to Strike","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"9/1/34","end_date":"9/1/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The textile workers had had enough. On September 1, 1934 at 11:30 p.m. they went on strike. Francis J. Gorman, Chairman of the National Special Strike Committee of the United Textile Workers of America, sent a telegraph to Alabama Governor Benjamin Miller to make him aware of the strike and the reasons behind it. Gorman reasoned that the workers themselves provided the authority for the strike and that it is a “result of abuses no longer bearable.” He listed several grievances of the textile workers and asked Governor Miller for the “protection which you are required to give all citizens.” Gorman sought protection from the “forces of employers” and, interestingly, “the insidious and disruptive forces of communism.” Gorman assured Miller that the strike will be “an orderly lawful and democratic procedure.” He concludes the telegram by requesting that the Governor ensure that they be treated fairly during the strike.","Historian Robert Ingalls discusses the plight of union workers and communist agitators in Birmingham during the 1930s. He asserts that the communists worked to provide equality between the classes and the races but were victims of the status quo. Big businesses, the employers Gorman feared, covertly promoted violence against communists in order to keep themselves in power. Ingalls writes that the communists wanted to improve workers’ rights and promote unions. Yet, in this telegram, Gorman spurned the communists. This is a unique perspective that historians have not fully studied. Ingalls acknowledges how the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People rejected any association with the communists, even as they attempted to help end racism and discrimination. However he doesn’t mention any tensions with unions. According to Ingalls, by 1934 Birmingham was “in the throes of strike fever.” He notes as labor unrest grew, so did anti-communist violence.  In fact, the crackdown caused some union spokesmen to argue that communists were being used as scapegoats to distract the public from the real cause of the strikes. Ingalls provides evidence that the communists and unions were on the same side yet this document opposes that belief. Perhaps pro-union men like Gorman simply did not like being associated with such an unfavorable group as the communists, even if they did share some beliefs.

Communists urged miners and steel workers to fight for higher wages. The communists proclaimed to be “giving leadership to the workers and raising real demands for them.” They urged white and black workers to band together and claimed that the unity of the two races on this issue had \"been a stirring example of how workers must fight to win their demands.” The communists included on the flier a list of demands that fighting workers should endorse. They demanded that workers stay on strike until they received better pay, developed rank and file leadership by elections and insisted on equal pay between the races. At the bottom of the flier, there was an invitation to join the Communist Party, which was leading the “revolutionary struggle to build a Soviet America.”","During the 1930s, the American Civil Liberties Union listed Birmingham as one of 11 \"centers of repression,\" and anti-communist violence peaked during this period. Communists advocated for whites, blacks, the poor and even women. These were truly revolutionary ideas for the time. The communists’ drive for equality went against the status quo and elicited  considerable backlash. Historian Robert Ingalls attributes this hostile response to establishment attitudes about labor. Communist ideas ran contrary to “business as usual” and big businesses, such as the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, felt threatened by their presence. These big corporations, which essentially dominated Birmingham economically, publically condemned communists and surreptitiously helped finance violence against them. ","Robin Kelley takes a different approach to studying the effects of the Communist Party in Birmingham. According to Kelley, anti-communists played on Southern fears of racial equality to attack the communist cause. The communists did not hide their messages of equality.  It is stated clearly on their fliers. They led protests in attempts to create equal conditions for blacks and whites. In Birmingham at this time, racial equality was not a popular sentiment. Membership in the infamous Ku Klux Klan went up for the first time in over a decade. To promote equality was to be a communist and the Klan could not allow such ideals to take hold. Unfortunately, racist politicians promoted the same sentiments. Kelley argues that much of the backlash against the Communist Party was a result of their egalitarian principles. From the flier, it is clear that both conditions--establishment condemnation of radicals and racism--were at work to hold back the rise of the Communist Party. The 1930s were a bleak time in Birmingham’s history but the workers struggled and fought when they could.  This spirit is embodied by the flier that read “Now is the time to fight!”"],"display_date":1934,"search_date":"1934-07-02","locations":[{"id":24536,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5257,"title":"<strong>Dr. Timothy Leary Defends Responsible Use of LSD</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"5/1/66","end_date":"5/31/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["By 1966, interest in LSD had proliferated in the public sphere to an enormous extent. The debate over the chemical’s risks and therapeutic possibilities led to Senate subcommittee hearings on its use. Acid, as LSD is commonly called, had been sensationalized by mass media publications and, although in its early years it had been extensively and responsibly studied by medical professionals, the effects of such a powerful chemical remained unclear. Psychologist Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent advocates of LSD, arguing that his medical research of LSD had shown tremendous therapeutic possibilities. However, many Americans remained suspicious of the chemical’s powerful nature. Chairman Thomas Dodd, a conservative Democrat from Connecticut, called for quick measures to stamp out the rapid spread of LSD among America’s youth generation.","In order to gain a better understanding of LSD’s implications, Senator Dodd convened subcommittee hearings on recreational drug use among America’s youth. Leary was one of many expert witnesses called to testify. In his testimony, he asserted that “the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them,” emphasizing the need for further investigation of LSD rather than complete prohibition. Leary also claimed that LSD and many other psychedelic drugs were not dangerous if used wisely and with precautions.","However, his opinion endured aggressive questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who criticized Leary’s testimony as “general hyperbole.” Additionally, the subcommittee chairman cited an earlier testimony by another doctor who argued that LSD encouraged homicidal tendencies and destructive behavior. Leary continued his attempts to placate the committee and remove LSD’s negative associations. When Kennedy asked if LSD usage was “extremely dangerous,” Leary replied, “Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly… Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.” Leary’s testimony urged for some type of licensing that would require LSD users to be highly trained, much like a pilot’s license, so that responsible adults could use LSD “for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.” He also noted that without such licensing, Americans faced “another era of prohibition” that would create a new group of college-educated white-collar criminals. In a later autobiographical work, Leary would claim that Kennedy’s bullying presence was merely an attempt “to gain respectability points by lynching me!”","Leary was one of many experts who testified at the 1966 subcommittee hearings, which showed both ardent support and uncompromising opposition to LSD. Its testimonies marked the conflict between medical professionals, intellectuals, and government officials who struggled to agree on LSD’s meaning as well its regulation. The hearings also embodied the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, which had conservative politicians utilizing acid as a scapegoat and to suppress radicalism among America’s younger generations. Just several months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California. By October 1968, possession of LSD was banned federally in the United States with the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill, marking a tremendous step towards the “War On Drugs” campaign that would arise in the 1970s."],"display_date":"May 1966","search_date":"1966-05-16","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5301,"title":"Georgia Congressman Alexander Stephens Discourages Southern Secession","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-11-01","end_date":"1860-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While angry Georgians voted in favor of secession in 1860, the small, sickly Georgia Congressman Alexander Stephens stood by and watched, helpless to avoid the crisis he had known was coming for years.  During Georgia’s secession in November of 1860, Congressman Stephens spoke in firm opposition.  Stephens, soon to be elected Vice President of the Confederacy, argued that Southern states should not secede until a Constitutional right was violated.  “If all our hopes are to be blasted, if the Republic is to go down,” exclaimed Stephens, “let us be found to the last moment standing on the deck with the Constitution of the United States waving over our heads.”","Alexander Stephens began his career in politics as a member of the Whig Party, focused on economic development through support of Henry Clay’s American System.  He worked with Zachary Taylor’s campaign for the election of 1848.  During the campaign he met Abraham Lincoln, and the two formed a friendly relationship.  When Taylor admitted California and New Mexico to the Union as free states, betraying Southern Whigs such as Stephens, Stephens reluctantly left the party and became a Democrat.","Stephens had been a strong supporter of Henry Clay’s Compromise of 1850, and in the rising conflict he referred to it as the ultimate law to be answered to—particularly in matters of popular sovereignty.  While his fellow Southerners became increasingly irate over the slavery debate in the 1850s, Stephens desperately referred to the Constitution and the Compromise of 1850, arguing that so long as none of the laws of these documents had been broken, the South had not been harmed.","When the South erupted with anger over the election of Illinois Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Stephens knew the Union could not last.  Georgia Governor Joe Brown called for a convention in November of 1860 to discuss possible secession, an idea most Georgians already supported.  At the convention Alexander Stephens spoke logically—though not passionately—against secession, on the grounds that no Constitutional law had been violated in Lincoln’s election.  Stephens declared, “The result was different from what we wished; but the election has been constitutionally held.”  Stephens further suggested that since the North had committed no Constitutional offense, the South should not secede until a Constitutional right was violated.  This way the South would be fighting with justice on their side, and not simply against the Constitution in which Stephens so strongly believed."],"display_date":"November 1848 - November 1860","search_date":"1854-11-15","locations":[{"id":1729,"lat":33.7797616598,"lng":-84.3046918113,"zoom":9,"place":"DE KALB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5314,"title":"Governor Hicks Sends a Message of Union Loyalty","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-18","end_date":"1861-04-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the secession movement began, the Union focused on keeping the key Border states loyal to the nation if war occurred.

Stuart’s most celebrated act was his encirclement of the Union General George McClellan’s Army of the Potomac in June of 1862. Newly appointed commander of the Army of Northern Virginia Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart devised the plan to circle around McClellan and gather intelligence. The aggressive strategy stemmed from the knowledge that McClellan was hesitant to attack the Confederate troops, which he believed to be incredibly large in size and powerful in strength.","In a message to Stuart on June 11, 1862, Lee expressed caution, stating that he should be careful not “to hazard unnecessarily your command or to attempt what your judgment may not approve but be content to accomplish all the good you can without feeling it necessary to obtain all that might be desired.” The letter from Lee to Stuart stressed the importance of the reconnaissance mission and the need for discretion. Stuart saddled his troops, consisting of 1, 200 men from the first, fourth, and ninth Virginia Cavalry, and the Jeff Davis Legion, on June 12, 1862, to determine if the Army of the Potomac occupied the land between the Chickahominy and Totopotomy Rivers. The value of the land between both rivers was essential for the Confederacy and the Union. During the reconnaissance mission ordered by Lee, Stuart realized that his position had been discovered, forcing him to find an alternate route back to Richmond. The alternate route led Stuart’s infamous ride around McClellan’s troops. Historian James McPherson stated Stuart gained fame from this event as well as “great personal satisfaction from the enterprise, for one of the opposing cavalry commanders was his father-in-law, Philip St. George Cooke.”","Stuart’s mission resulted in his troops spending four days behind enemy lines in which they covered over 100 miles. The troops captured 165 prisoners as well as 260 mules<em>.</em> Stuart fulfilled the desires of Lee, who stated in his letter the importance of “gaining intelligence of his operations, communications, &c., of driving in his foraging parties, and securing such grain, cattle, &c., for ourselves as you can make arrangements to have driven in.” The encirclement of McClellan resulted in the recognition of the need for a reformed Union cavalry. After the successful raid commenced, Stuart felt that he had the capability to outride and outfight any Union cavalryman, boosting Southern morale even more. The intelligence that Stuart gathered allowed Lee to attack at Mechanicsville, which was the first of the Seven Days’ battles, and contributed in the failure of McClellan’s Peninsula campaign."],"display_date":"June 12, 1862 - June 15, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-13","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5350,"title":"Attorney General William on Enforcement Acts","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-04-02","end_date":"1875-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Colfax massacre of 1872, believed to be the most devastating occurrence of racial violence during Reconstruction, resulted in the death of around 150 freedmen at the hands of white supremacists. The events at Colfax resulted in only three men to convicted. However, disagreement led to the case entering the Supreme Court in the form of <em>United States v. Cruikshank </em>in 1876. The case brought in to question the constitutionality of the Enforcement Acts. It questioned if the federal government had the jurisdiction to enforce these acts on the state level.","The Enforcement Acts were issued in 1870 and 1871; they sought to prevent intimidation of voters and discrimination based on one’s skin color. The Acts also issued specific crimes committed by the Ku Klux Klan as federal offenses and those who committed them would be punished based on federal standards. Many white Southerners believed the Enforcement Acts were a violation of State’s rights. During the <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank </em>Supreme Court case, Attorney General Williams argued that the Enforcement Acts were necessary to protect the right to vote for African Americans. Williams argued that government could not exist without votes from its citizens, and as citizens, African Americans deserve the opportunity to cast their vote. He stated, “If Congress has no power to protect the voters, then the White League of Louisiana, a minority of the people, can stand around the polls and prevent the majority from voting.”","The results of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em> were devastating for those in support of the Enforcement Act. The men were charged with using their power to halt African Americans from voting. However, the government did not charge them with using race as a motive in the massacre. The error in wording resulted in the three men to going free, leaving no one held responsible for the horrific massacre against the freedmen.","The Court went further to state that the federal government only had the right to prohibit the violations of black rights in states only, they did not hold the power for punishing criminal acts committed by individuals, the state and local authority held this right. Historian Eric Foner commented, “In the name of federalism, the decision rendered national prosecution of crimes committed against blacks virtually impossible, and gave a green light to acts of terror where local officials either could not or would not enforce the law.” The devastating result of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em>, allowed acts of violence against freedmen and republicans to escalate in the following years because of the inability of the federal government to try individuals."],"display_date":"April 2, 1875","search_date":"1875-04-02","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5352,"title":"Display of the Confederate Flag in Richmond Sparks Anger in Congress","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-02-17","end_date":"1867-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 17, 1867 the <em>New York Times</em> reported on an act of reoccurring rebelliousness that happened within the city of Richmond, Virginia.  The incident that sparked all of the emotion was the display of the Confederate Flag during an event within the city.  Members of Congress and other Union loyalists decided that this act of rebelliousness proved that some of the southern states such as Virginia were, “utterly unfit for reconstruction” and that “the rebellious spirit still lived and raged in the South.”","Many called for legislation that would put the southern states under complete military rule.  The article went on to explain that the incident in question was actually just two young boys, one white and one black, pretending to be soldiers with an old faded flag that did not resemble that of the Confederate battle flag.

The May 24, 1848 issue of the<em> Californian,</em> a newspaper out of San Francisco, published an article expressing local views on slavery; “Wherever slavery exists it is invariably accompanied with a supineness and stagnation of the vital blood of a nation, consequent upon the prevalence of the short-sighted idea that to work for a living is ungentlemanly.”  The population of California had largely lived under Mexican rule, under which slavery had been outlawed for some time. The previously Mexican population, combined with a lack of major immigration from southern states, yielded a territory in which free labor was the dominate system.  Not only did slavery not develop in California, the working Californians held a resistance to the institution, which considered physical labor the domain of slaves, and not of gentlemen.","The<em> Californian</em> continued to attack the institution of slavery, holding it responsible for a perceived lack of southern motivation: “Take, for example, the state of Georgia, one of the best lumber regions in the United States. Thousands of pine trees are rotting in her forests, while the lumber used in house-building is imported from Maine.” In the author’s view, the unmotivated whites in southern states made up a “class of ‘unproductive consumers,’” that was “fearfully large.”","The labor system in the North was much more akin to the ranch and farm life in southern California and the mines in the northern part of the territory.  This similarity, in contrast to the clash with southern values, helped firmly place California’s ties with the northern states and the free labor system.","Like many free states, California’s resistance to slavery did not stem from a moral stance, as much as from a desire to protect free labor.  According to historian David Lavender the legislators banned slavery as much because they were opposed to the idea of free men working beside blacks as they were against the institution of slavery.  He also reported that several of the state-makers considered barring all blacks from the state, free or slave.","In 1850 congress settled the debate over California through the famed compromise of that year, in which the South was pacified with a new and tougher Fugitive Slave Act, and the reorganization of Utah and New Mexico into territories that could determine whether or not they would allow slavery on their own.  However, California was admitted to the Union as a free state, a state that reflected the opinions of its people, not a State brought into the Union as a simple means of balancing power between two competing factions."],"display_date":"May 12, 1848 - September 20, 1850","search_date":"1849-07-16","locations":[{"id":15203,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5681,"title":"The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 and its Deinstitutionalizing Effect on Saint Elizabeth's Hospital","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"10/31/63","end_date":"10/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Due to a growing need for mental health services, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was built by the United States Congress as a result of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Act of 1852.

A prominent leader in the mental health field, Dorthea Dix, lobbied for the construction of the facility and founded the facility with the goal of providing the \"most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.” Before this, many of the patients that could be considered “insane” were simply put in jail and were not receiving the care they needed. The name of the facility was later changed to Saint Elizabeth’s in 1916 because it temporarily provided medical care for wounded soldiers during the Civil War and those that were being treated were reluctant to tell people that they were being cared for at a mental institution. Instead they used the name of the colonial area the hospital was originally built on, Saint Elizabeth’s.

At its prime in the 1940’s, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was home to over 7,000 patients.","Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital now operates with a small fraction of that number of patients, largely due to a certain historical event, the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. This Act, fully titled the “Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963,” promoted community-based health care and provided federal funding for such facilities. One of the main purposes of this act to was provide government assistance “in improving mental health through grants for construction of community mental health centers.” The government began to fund the construction of outpatient facilities in order to allow mental patients to live more normal lives. Prior to this, mental hospitals were what Erving Goffman would consider “total institutions,” meaning that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was a place in which all of the patients’ activities took place with a large group of others on a schedule, which shut the patients off from the rest of society. This act led to a considerable amount of deinstitutionalization all over the country. The total number of mentally ill patients that were institutionalized went from 650,000 in 1955 to less than 150,000 in 1983. The act, in conjunction with the quickly deteriorating living conditions at the hospital, meant that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was no exception.  With the passage of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, more patients opted for outpatient care and the number of patients at the hospital steadily declined."],"display_date":"October 31, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-31","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5682,"title":"St. Elizabeth's: From 'Asylum' to 'Hospital'","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/11","end_date":"12/31/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1911, a committee comprised of six representatives appointed by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Attorney General, the Commissioners of the District of The Board of Visitors of the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior were chosen to assess the needs of the Government Hospital for the Insane.  Within the report that was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior, there was an initiative to “eliminate the word ‘insane’” from the name of the institution—citing the reminder of the institution’s purpose as “extremely disagreeable.” Within five years, the official name change became a reality.","The committee failed, however, to specify to what name the hospital should be changed.  Through analysis of other accounts of the institution’s history, it can be determined that the origins of the name St. Elizabeths occurred during the Civil War, when Congress authorized use of the hospital for the care of the sick and wounded soldiers of the Union Army.  The wounded Union soldiers treated at the hospital during the war were reluctant to write to their families that they were being treated in the Government Hospital for the Insane and instead chose to refer to the hospital as St. Elizabeth’s, after the name of the land the hospital was built upon, in order to avoid the stigma of an insane asylum.","The soldiers in St. Elizabeth’s are an early example of reframing a place or word in order to circumvent cultural assumptions of mentally ill individuals and asylums.  Examples of this can be seen today in movements such as Spread the Word to End the Word, a movement to stop the use of the word “retarded” in everyday speech, in order to avoid stigmas that are associated with mentally disabled individuals and allow others to see them as functioning members of society.","As stated by Goffman, a byproduct of a total institution such as an asylum is the stigmatization of “inmates,” among other consequences such as loss of individual liberties. The Civil War soldiers being treated at the Government Hospital for the Insane for battle wounds were aware of the social stigmatization of asylums and were reluctant to admit to being treated there, regardless of the reason.  Although the understanding of mental illness was becoming more factual at that time, society’s perceptions of insane asylums were filled will incurable monsters—not just individuals with different needs than the rest of society, as people with disabilities are seen today.  The soldiers avoided using the hospital’s true name in order to keep their families from worrying that war had changed them from heroes fighting for the Union into people that needed to be isolated from society.","Though the reasoning behind the exact name change is unclear, by renaming the hospital St. Elizabeth’s—a neutral, assumption-free title—as opposed to the Government Hospital for the Insane, it helped to remove some of the stigma of an insane asylum.  By characterizing it as simply a hospital, Congress re-framed the place as one of healing and care for those affected mentally in the process of serving their country instead of as a total institution—framing not only the hospital itself, but mental illness in general, in a more positive light."," "],"display_date":"1911 -

Taylor and William S. Harney, in Kansas to seal their tribes’ fate in America on October 21, 1867. The United States government referred to the Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache as a peace treaty, but in reality it forced the tribes to conform to the wills and regulations set forth by the United States government. The treaty demanded that the three Indian tribes confederate and “to be placed, in every respect, upon an equal footing.” The three tribes merged together and were required “to accept as their permanent home the reservation described in the aforesaid treaty” and “to pledge themselves to make no permanent settlement at any place, nor on any lands, outside of said reservation.” All aspects of life on the reservation had to be equally shared and distributed such as clothes, jobs, school buildings, teachers, and the educational system. The United States government required the Indians to keep peace with the white men and every citizen under the jurisdiction of the United States government. This treaty also stated that by signing this treaty this treaty, the Indian tribes “give up and forever relinquish to the United States all rights, privileges, and grants now vested in them, or intended to be transferred to them.” The people of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes gave up their culture, independence, and their tribes’ futures when they signed this treaty.","In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the United States government did not allow Indian tribes to practice their own culture, live freely, and the government did not believe that Indians should be privileged with the common rights of citizens of the United States of America. The government rejected Indians as citizens of the United States. This is evident because the treaty of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes forced the tribes to assimilate with one another and live as if they had always been one uniformed, equal tribe. The Indians’ daily lives were completely changed, and every aspect of their lives was under direct control of the United States government, especially the Native Americans’ educational system. Although this educational system set forth by the government was presented as a gift and a privilege, it is evident that it wasn’t very advantageous, and the educational system did not put the Native Americans’ needs first.","The historian David Adams shows that in reality, these educational institutions created on Native American reservations intended to completely restructure the Native American’s minds and personalities. In attempts to civilize the savage Native Americans, the government forced the children to cut their hair and wear standard American school uniforms, instead of their normal tribal clothing. Some children were also taken from the families and home reservations and transported to other reservations to attend boarding school. In making such drastic changes to the children’s lifestyles, it was inevitable that the children would become more Americanized, which is exactly what the United States government wanted. The rights and privileges of the Native Americans were truly relinquished to the United States government, just like the Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache enforced; the Native Americans did not even have control of their children and their children’s education.  These said advantages, like an educational system, given to the Native Americans were not really advantages at all. They were just a ploy in order for the United States government to gain what they wanted, land ownership, and keep the Native Americans out of their way to manifest destiny.<br /><br />"],"display_date":"October 21, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-21","locations":[{"id":4489,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"SHAWNEE, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5700,"title":"Native American Education Improves Under U.S. Government","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/76","end_date":"12/31/76","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States outlined the needs, concerns, funding, and progresses of the Indian educational system set forth by the government. The National Advisory Council on Indian Education created this report in 1976 in Washington, D.C. The president of the United States appointed this council in order to assist the 570 native groups affected by the regulations of the Indian educational system. The council comprised of Americans who observed and worked with the native groups. Observations of the council members “revealed that much remains to be done before adequate and equal educational opportunities can be achieved by the Indian people.” The annual report stated that for the Indian people, Indian Education “is a method of teaching that revives an appreciation for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image so that one accepts and understands the environment and social conditions surrounding him.” This appreciation of Indian heritage and positive self-image was lost many years ago when the American government first intruded onto Indian territories. The council addressed this loss in the report to Congress by stating that the American Indians’ 200 years experience under an authoritarian paternal relationship with the Federal Government has “clearly demonstrated that paternalism is alien to liberty and freedom.”","The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States clearly showed how the government progressed and improved upon the Indian Educational System. Historian David Adams exposed that the government originally created the Indian Educational System to civilize the natives, because the natives were believed to be savages. The school system intended to provide the natives with an education that would habituate them to the customs and advantages of a civilized life. The government tried to manipulate the natives into becoming exactly like American citizens, regardless of their heritage, religion, traditions, or tribal affiliations. The government believed that since the native ways of life were different than the traditional American lifestyle, the natives must be less civilized than American citizens. The government most recently formed educational policies regarding Indian Education with goals to respect the wishes and the desires of natives so that the natives may design and manage their own educational programs according to the tribal level. The United States government has allowed the natives to incorporate their own values, beliefs, and culture into the natives’ educational system instead of strictly regulating every aspect of native life. In reality, there has never truly been an American Educational system prior to modern-day; the faux system was based on the standard methods and systems of the non-Indian society and a process by which the government has tried to teach the natives how to become like the white man."],"display_date":1976,"search_date":"1976-07-01","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5775,"title":"Blind Man Perishes in the New York Transit System","course_id":117,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/36","end_date":"10/31/36","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Readers that leafed through the December 30, 1936 issue of the <em>Globe and Mail</em> stumbled upon a brief article, scarcely three tiny columns long, about a man who perished in a curious circumstance (“Blind” 14). New York City resident Oscar England had been without sight his entire life and died earlier that day apparently due to trusting too highly in his ‘eerie’ (the <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporter implied) innate ability to know where he stood in relation to his surroundings(“Blind” 14). The<em> Globe and Mail</em> reporter professed that England’s ability had proven dependable for nearly three and a half decades, and turned out to be especially useful during a nearly decade-long period of frequent subway travel (“Blind” 14). England required no accompaniment whether navigating New York City’s packed walkways or confusing mazelike subway terminals (“Blind” 14). This talent allowed England to precisely discern the distance and way needed to reach various destinations, such as different underground trains… until December (“Blind” 14). On that date, England overestimated the distance to the boarding zone and tumbled down onto the tracks, directly in the path of a train that steadily drew nearer (“Blind” 14). It took close to sixty minutes for an accident response teamto extricate England’s remains out from the middle of the solid platform and the subway cars (“Blind” 14).","England’s death (perhaps ironically) occurred shortly after the initial introduction of United States government aid towards individuals with disabilities (“Blind” 14) (Shriner 480). Parties, ranging from relatives of individuals with disabilities, to state bureaucrats, to a team involving a mental health patient and a medical professional, founded prominent mental and physical disability societies early on, in 1909 and 1927, and as late as 1950 (Shriner 480). The aforementioned societies officially identified with, or complimented efforts by, the American government (Shriner 480).","Some of this increased American state disability-assistance specifically benefitted the blind (Shriner 480-481). Since the year 1920, state-run workforce-rehabilitation agencies were directed towards individuals with disabilities (Shriner 484). However, these rehabilitation agencies initially displayed an inability to adequately meet the requirements of individuals without sight (Shriner 482). The resulting early-1940’s Barden-LaFollette Vocational Rehabilitation Act (BLVRA) allowed government-run blind-assistance-organizations to operate blind-individual-specific sections within government rehabilitation agencies (Shriner 482). The BLVRA addressed the aforementioned limitation of the rehabilitation agencies, but also had an overarching purpose of tapping into a hitherto-unexploited potential labour force (visually-impaired individuals) (Shriner 482). Also in the early-1940’s, blind-individual advocacy groups made government officials aware that proposed tax rate modifications, if implemented, would disadvantage the blind citizenry to a greater extent than the non-blind (Shriner 483). The United States Congress thus decided to allow a set amount of blind individuals’ costs to be exempted (Shriner 483). Earlier on, in a somewhat ‘eerie’ coincidence (as the <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporter implied about England’s ability the same year), 1936 saw the advent of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (Shriner 481) (“Blind” 14). The Randolph-Sheppard Act ultimately allowed blind persons a near-total monopoly over holding positions as merchants in federal government structures (Shriner 481-482)."],"display_date":"October 1936","search_date":"1936-10-16","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1812,"tag":"blind"},{"id":1811,"tag":"disability support"},{"id":1810,"tag":"disability"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":117,"school_id":28}},{"id":6082,"title":"<strong>The United States Sues <em>The</em> <em>Progressive</em> Over Nuclear Secrets</strong>","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"3/9/79","end_date":"3/28/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 9, 1979, the U.S. Government issued a restraining order that stopped <em>The Progressive </em>from publishing an article entitled, “<em>The H-Bomb Secret: How We Got It, Why We're Telling It.”</em> The question posed to the court by the U.S. was, “…a clash between allegedly vital security interests of the United States and the competing constitutional doctrine against prior restraint in publication.” The U.S. also said that if a document poses a threat to national security than it should be classified as such and be censored justly to protect the security of the people it is supposed to protect. <em>The Progressive</em> argued, “While acknowledging that freedom of the press is not absolute, they maintain that the publication of the projected article does not rise to the level of immediate, direct and irreparable harm which could justify incursion into First Amendment freedoms.”","<em>The Progressive</em> is a magazine published in Madison, Wisconsin.

Great Britain had not responded to either diplomatic negotiations or threats made by the United States.

Sullivan tried to present the Embargo Act in a positive light, as a federal action the demonstrated of unity and independence for the nation. The Federalist Party had dominated the Statehouse, and Wheaton had gained recognition for authoring the resolves.

Should Eisenhower run for nomination, Walter Trohan reported to the <em>Chicago Tribune,</em> he expected Eisenhower “to support foreign policy, especially as it relates to maintaining the victory won in Europe where he was war time supreme commander.”","Unfortunately for the Republican Party, as the Supreme Commander of NATO, Eisenhower felt duty required him to abstain from running for President. In addition to Taft, Harold Stassen, Earl Warren, and Theodore McKeldin planned to campaign for president, but the internationalist Republicans did not believe any of them could take the nomination away from Taft. They wanted Eisenhower.","The “Draft Eisenhower” Campaign started years before. As early as 1947, President Harry Truman offered to step aside for General Eisenhower to run as the Democratic candidate, with Truman as his running mate. At the time, Eisenhower said ‘no.’ Four years later, Truman again asked Eisenhower if he would run, and again Eisenhower refused. In response, Eisenhower secretly made the offer to Taft.","Meanwhile, moderate Republicans Henry Cabot Lodge and Thomas Dewey asked Eisenhower to run for president on the Republican ticket. Eisenhower, like George Marshall and George Patton, believed generals should be nonpartisan, to maintain the professionalism of the military officer corps. Because of this nonpartisan pledge, Eisenhower never voted in a presidential election until 1948, after he retired.","Eisenhower maintained he had no desire to be president. In March 1952, his conversation with Herbert Brownell, former campaign planner for Dewey, changed his mind. Brownell told Eisenhower that Taft was the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and if Eisenhower wanted the nation to pursue internationalist policies, he must run. After decades of Democratic presidents, the country would likely vote for change. In 1951, Stalin announced the Soviet Union had a hydrogen bomb; by 1952, the cease-fire talks with Korea deadlocked. If Eisenhower wanted to ensure internationalist foreign policy, he needed to run in the primaries against Taft. Shortly after the meeting, Eisenhower renounced his nonpartisanship. He announced he would run for Republican nomination."],"display_date":"December 8, 1951 - April 24, 1952","search_date":"1952-02-14","locations":[{"id":52983,"lat":48.856614,"lng":2.3522219,"zoom":8,"place":"Paris, France"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9040418,"lng":-77.0388036,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3161,"tag":"Robert A.

Swift, a writer, social activist, speaker, and pamphleteer, focused on social and political theory.","Germany saw a rise in socialist ideas as they neared the twentieth century. The German Social Democratic Party became one of Germany’s most popular parties, and saw massive gains in the Reichstag since 1890. Socialism also saw a rise in popularity in the election of 1900 in the United States.  Swift said, “The German elections are likely to have a very notable influence upon the American working classes in changing this, by calling their attention to politics as a method far more potent than the strike.” Unfair and dangerous working conditions brought on by rapid industrialization, such as low wages, long hours, and work-related injuries, led to strikes and standoffs between laborers and managers. Swift mentioned the unhappiness of the laborer in society, writing that workers finally realized that there may be something wrong with the interactions between labor and capital.","Between 1900 and 1904, Socialism gained popularity in a region of 20 states bounded by Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, and Maryland. This region accounted for the most socialists in office, along with between 60 percent and 85 percent of the Socialist party vote. This region was also heavily industrialized. Counties known for having unions and industry working against each other tended to vote more Socialists into office and have a more Socialist leaning during the presidential election.","Swift likened the American trust leaders to the German Emperor, William the Second, saying, “Our heads of industry and finance are bearing down on the people in ways as surprising and obnoxious to us as a free nation, as William’s ways are obnoxious and intolerable to Germany as an unfree nation.” Swift predicted that such conditions would unleash a gradual rise in popularity for Socialism. Swift mentioned, “It seems that we should recognize that Socialism is to spring into a great, perhaps huge, practical force in this country in a very short time.” In 1900, the Democratic Socialist Party, led by Eugene V. Debs, had only 0.6 percent of the popular vote, but by 1904 the Socialist Party, also led by Debs, had risen to three percent of the popular vote.","Swift highlighted the fact that Germans saw less industrialization than the United States, yet still ran to Socialism to protect themselves from industrialization. He predicted that the American laborers would run to the arms of Socialism for protection, and that it was inevitable to avoid the revolution. Despite Swift’s predictions, Socialism would decline in popularity and would almost die out after the First World War."],"display_date":"June 29, 1903","search_date":"1903-06-29","locations":[{"id":52989,"lat":42.927205,"lng":-76.1289029,"zoom":5,"place":"New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3176,"tag":"Labor Movement"},{"id":3175,"tag":"1903"},{"id":3174,"tag":"1904 Election"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1090,"tag":"strikes"},{"id":896,"tag":"Labor"},{"id":2188,"tag":"Socialism"},{"id":2781,"tag":"Election"}],"course":{"name":"History of U.S. Presidential Elections","school":"Wayne State University","course_id":163,"school_id":92}},{"id":6619,"title":"A Voter Reacts to the Kennedy - Nixon Debates.","course_id":163,"status":"P","start_date":"9/26/60","end_date":"9/26/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 26, 1960 Henry R. Clark, a real estate broker from Jackson, Florida sat down after dinner in front of his television. He was vigorously flipping through the channels in excitement to see Richard Nixon debate. Henry was a proud Republican and he considered himself a supporter of Nixon’s. Clark was just in time as the two candidates took the stage. Senator John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts was a very wealthy, youthful and intelligent man. He had served six years in the House of Representatives and eight years in the Senate, but had little experience in foreign affairs. On the other hand, President Eisenhower’s Vice President Nixon had many years of experience. During Nixon’s years in the Senate he toured Europe reporting on the Marshall Plan and he served on a committee that exposed a communist spy ring in the United States. After being elected Vice President he had toured thirty countries in the East and was the first diplomat to visit Japan after World War II. He famously debated Nikita Khrushchev during the “The Kitchen Debates.” Unfortunately for Nixon the first debate against Kennedy did not include foreign affairs. The debate’s topic focused on domestic policy in which Kennedy excelled.","Clark noticed that Nixon did not seem up to par. Henry saw a thin and tired Nixon. He thought Vice President Nixon seemed nervous due to his constant shifting in his seat. Nixon recently had been diagnosed and still suffered from an infection in his knee cap. He was hospitalized for the infection weeks earlier. On the other hand, Clark observed a very confident, eloquent and prepared Kennedy. He saw the senator take the first debate very seriously. Kennedy proved that to the audience in his style and readiness."," At the end of the program Kennedy gained a new supporter in Clark. Kennedy proved that he was not a naïve man but an intelligent and thoughtful one.  The next morning Clark was approached by a reporter asking what his thoughts were on the debate last night. Clark answered, “He really came out last night. I’d been leaning toward Nixon, but now I think Kennedy’s the boy.

News of this exchange quickly spread among the Confederate prisoners held at Fort Delaware, although the more skeptical men pointed out the lack of evidence, and without further information, the discussion quieted. The rumor revived when a Union sergeant told an officer guarding prisoners there had been an exchange, and the federal government was arranging another. On August 17, 1864 a Union officer named Sergeant Murphy called six hundred names, all officers, who the prisoners believed would be the next group exchanged. One prisoner, John Ogden Murray, wrote: “When the M’s were called on the roll I could hardly contain myself; when my name was called I could have shouted for joy; and I really felt sorry that all my comrades were not included in the list, as we thought, for exchange.” When there was no movement from their guards the next day, the prisoners began thinking that the whole thing had been a cruel joke, until finally, at 3 p.m. August 20, 1864, roll was called again and the six hundred ordered to take their belongings and march onto the steamship <em>Crescent City</em> headed for Morris Island, South Carolina. After eighteen days, with only brief turns above deck, the ship arrived off Morris Island early in the morning of September 7, 1864. Unfortunately for the prisoners, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant sent a letter on August 21, 1864, specifically forbidding the exchange of the prisoners now at Morris Island. Prisoner exchanges were officially halted in July 1863, due to Confederate refusal to include black prisoners of war, but some generals continued arranging unofficial exchanges. By 10 a.m. September 7, 1864 the prisoners were informed there was no intention of exchanging them. The general who ordered the prisoners to Morris Island, Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, was retaliating for Union prisoners of war being placed in the parts of Charleston the Union was shelling. The battery on Morris Island was a target of the guns in Charleston, and he hoped the Confederates would be reluctant to fire on their own men. Although none of the prisoners died from the artillery, they were far from comfortable. Murray wrote that rations consisted of “the luxurious diet of four hardtack army crackers, one ounce of fat meat, and half a pint of sandy bean soup (which often tasted like it had been seasoned with soap).” The prisoners had to dig to the water table to get anything to drink. Three prisoners died on Morris Island of starvation-related illnesses. In early October 1864 a yellow fever outbreak in Charleston led the Confederates to remove their prisoners of war from the city, and in response Foster ordered the men, who would eventually be known as the Immortal 600, moved to Fort Pulaski at the mouth of the Savannah River. They stayed there until March 4, 1865, when they returned to Fort Delaware to wait out the end of the war."],"display_date":"August 4, 1864 - March 4, 1865","search_date":"1864-11-17","locations":[{"id":53080,"lat":32.02706,"lng":-80.8904868,"zoom":15,"place":"Fort Pulaski, Georgia"},{"id":53079,"lat":32.7124021,"lng":-79.8940806,"zoom":15,"place":"Morris Island, South Carolina"},{"id":53078,"lat":39.5906951,"lng":-75.5721664,"zoom":13,"place":"Fort Delaware, Delaware"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}},{"id":6746,"title":"Expression of Opinion on the French-Canadian Divide","course_id":179,"status":"P","start_date":"8/10/60","end_date":"12/30/61","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 30, 1961 <em>The Globe and Mail</em> printed an article about a newspaper article printed by the University of Toronto Varsity regarding criticism of Québec separatism. The co-editor who wrote the piece was accused of French-Canadian nationalism for not growing academically in Quebec, infringing civil liberties, and accusing French-Canadian culture is not with modern times but of the last century. Various editors from universities across Canada of both English and French language expressed their opinion on the matter detailing the right of freedom of expression but also the requirement for a writer to have all the facts before writing; what the facts are were not included. Some editors were for the motion to censure, whereas the Varsity writer of the controversial editorial, Mr. Musgrove, would prefer those who were disappointed by the article to write a letter to the editor. The article brought on a split at the Canadian University Press national conference, although a slim majority of student editors refused to censure the Varsity. The delegates at the Ryerson University eventually voted 12 to 10 against the motion to censure. Despite this the issue doesn’t seem to end here as, the president of the CUP charter is to poll all member newspapers on their opinion of Musgrove’s article and results will be published in the students papers the following month. In the end, the conference is supporting a study of the causes for the discord and finding ways to remove them. "," ","The 1960s introduced many reforms called the “Quiet Revolution” (Révolution tranquille) in Québec under Premier Jean Lesage of the Québec Liberal Party. Some plans included: establishment of a public hospital network, creation of ministries of cultural affairs and for federal-provincial relations, lowering the legal age to vote from 21 to 18. During this time John Diefenbaker was Prime Minister and while dealing with an economic-slowdown after World War II did not seem at ease with this new display of Québec nationalism. Diefenbaker pursued a “One Canada” or “unhyphenated Canadianism” policy, a single Canadian nation for people of all ethnic origins under a government that would respect everyone’s fundamental human rights and would not allow to make special exceptions to Québec’s Francophones. In 1960, his government passed a federal Bill of Rights emphasizing individual freedoms of every Canadian. The political divide at the time was also in due part of Lesage being part of the Québec Liberal Party, and Diefenbaker being part of the Progressive Conservatives. Whereas Lesage wanted to modernize Québec independently with new reforms Diefenbaker’s outlook was to keep Canada united as one entity under the category of Canadians respectively. These ideologies of what it means to be a Canadian or Québecois at the time did lead to people being on opposing sides and expressing their opinions on the matter that sometimes seemed to divide rather than unite people which is reflected in the debate on university campuses caused by voicing conflicting beliefs. "],"display_date":"August 10, 1960 - December 30, 1961","search_date":"1961-04-20","locations":[{"id":53097,"lat":43.653226,"lng":-79.3831843,"zoom":8,"place":"Toronto, Canada"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":3426,"tag":"Nationalism"},{"id":600,"tag":"Media"},{"id":3505,"tag":"Freedom of Expression"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":179,"school_id":28}},{"id":6824,"title":"Humanitarian, Yet Overwhelmed Canada, Saves Another Family's Life.","course_id":189,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/89","end_date":"2/15/96","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 19, 1995, <em>The Globe and Mail </em>reported an attention-grabbing incident. Nazrul Bhuiyan, an honest Bangladeshi journalist who wrote articles exposing the military-run Bangladeshi government corruption, was no longer safe in his country. Consequently, in 1989, with his wife and four children, Bhuiyan sought refugee status in Toronto, Canada. Realizing that 10,000 Bangladeshis already in Canada had no local newspaper and eager to inform people about what was happening in Bangladesh, in 1991, he started the monthly Deshe Bideshe. In 1992, his refugee claim was denied; consequently, he appealed. On September 16, 1995, Bhuiyan received an award from Ethnic Press Council of Canada for his outstanding journalism. Three days later, his appeal failed, along with a notice of removal. The saddening factor was the existence of the policy of deferred removals order class (DROC) since 1994, stating “refugees who had been in Canada for three years after their claim was rejected, could apply to remain here permanently, provided they had worked for six months and did not have a criminal record.” (<em>The Globe and Mail</em>, 1995). The Bhuiyan family had only two months left for the eligibility. The community that he helped by also setting up information telephone lines, and a desktop publishing business and in which he became a social figure, helped him along with his lawyer by sending letters to the immigration minister, requesting a review on the rejection for his approval. As a result, the federal court ordered an investigation. The earned public voice led to a quiet in-depth investigation, which resulted in the permanent residency on February 15th, 1996 (<em>Toronto Star, 1996).</em>","<em><br /></em>","Between 1982-1990 Bangladesh was ruled by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a dictator who came to power through a coup. Ershad imposed the martial law, meaning the suspension of ordinary law by military take-over. The elections were neither fair nor free (Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, 2008). Under the first immigration Act of Canada, anyone in good health and financial condition could enter the country. The new immigration act was put in action in 1978. This new act focused on how to select immigrants that were more beneficial for the country by deciding on “who” could enter the country, it also added “refugees” as a class of immigrants (Dirks, 1984). With the popularity of refugees, many people started to seek asylum although they were safe, to enter Canada without status (Dirks, 1984). The increase in non-documented people led Canada to restrict the entrances and the refugee cases. Bhuiyan’s case was weak for the lack of evidence, but mostly since it took so long for the case to be heard, the government had changed and therefore so did the credibility of his claim (even though the recent regime was also problematic), these factors led already drowning refugee case judges, decide on deportation of the victim. Canada still welcomed so many people. In 2007, approximately 100,000 Bangladeshi-origin people were living in Canada according to the Bangladesh High Commission report."," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1989 - February 15, 1996","search_date":"1992-07-24","locations":[{"id":53097,"lat":43.653226,"lng":-79.3831843,"zoom":6,"place":"Toronto, Canada"}],"tags":[{"id":3614,"tag":"Freedom of writing"},{"id":3613,"tag":"DROC"},{"id":1765,"tag":"Asylum"},{"id":3612,"tag":"Reporter"},{"id":366,"tag":"Migration"},{"id":3611,"tag":"Military Corruption"},{"id":3610,"tag":"Bangladesh"},{"id":3290,"tag":"Deportation"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":189,"school_id":28}},{"id":6863,"title":"Daniel Webster Refutes Robert Hayne's Attack on New England in the Great Senate Debate of 1830","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-26","end_date":"1830-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 26 and 27, 1830, senators Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts got into a heated debate that captured many of the issues that threatened to tear the nation apart. The main issues involved the tariff and nullification. Two days prior to Webster’s reply, Hayne delivered a speech in Congress that attacked Webster by questioning his loyalty to the Constitution. In this speech, Hayne said that the South had \"everything to lose and nothing to gain.\" He believed the tariff only sought \"the protection of Northern shipping and New England seamen\" while the South reaped no benefits. The audience expected Webster to deliver a reply, and he did not let them down. Webster began his reply by saying, “…It is, Sir, the people’s Constitution, the people’s government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people.” Throughout the course of this reply, Webster argued that the federal government provided everything for the country. He stated that the sectional conflict resulted from the claims of state’s rights since the state governments tried to insert themselves into the areas recognized as the purview of the federal government.","Sectional beliefs divided the Senate which emphasized the tensions between the North and the South. At this point, the southern states felt that the federal government violated their rights by imposing the tariff. Robert Hayne advocated for states’ rights. According to Harlow W. Sheidley, he also proposed the doctrine of nullification in which a state could nullify laws that they considered unconstitutional like the tariff. This served as a pretext to the Nullification Crisis that would cause South Carolina to threaten secession. In Webster’s reply to Hayne, he argued that the southern states secede since the Constitution applies to both the North and the South. This debate brought into question the limits of what the federal government could do.","Webster’s reply to Hayne revealed his sense of federalism. His counterargument suggests that he saw a common identity as a country, not just North and South. Clearly, Webster tried to promote federalism over sectionalism. In his reply to Hayne, he implicitly stated his belief that the Constitution created the framework of the federal government. Webster believed that the federal government had the right to handle any conflict between the state and federal governments over an issue not clarified in the Preamble of the US Constitution. This explains his opposition to nullification, which justifies why he argued that states such as South Carolina had no right to nullify the tariff.  A century later, Senator Robert C. Byrd recognized that Webster knew how to appeal to a national audience during a time of governmental polarization. He also knew how to diffuse a situation by changing the subject. And because he possessed this knowledge, he decided to persuade people of the importance of a single democratic union. However, many southerners fully opposed these beliefs. Therefore, Daniel Webster’s reply to Hayne embodies the true sectional crisis that eventually leads to the American Civil War."],"display_date":"January 26, 1830 - January 27, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-26","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.898899496695,"lng":-77.032655531551,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"},{"id":150,"tag":"Senate"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":371,"tag":"Debate"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
