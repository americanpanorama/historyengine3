They concluded \"that thrift and industry be encouraged to the fullest extent among our people. That the education of the young receive the closest attention from parents and guardians,\" and \"that the idea of property getting be stimulated.\"  Thus continuing with their self determination principles that started from the beginning of the town since \"August 15, 1887,\" when \"27 registered voters, all black men, met in a building they call Town Hall and voted unanimously to incorporate.\"  The push for schools in Eatonville to continue vocational training falls in line with Booker T.

Zora once said:","\"I was born in a Negro town.  I do not mean by that the black backside of an average town.  Eatonville, Florida is, and was at the time of my birth, a pure Negro town-charter, mayor, council, town marshal and all.  It was not the first Negro community in America, but it was the first to be incorporated, the first attempt at organized self-government on the part of Negroes in America.\"","Zora’s life reflects the same “attempt” as did the formation and incorporation of Eatonville; she paved the way for all female writers in America, specifically those of African descent, through the strength of her own story.","Throughout history, Zora can often be found on the frontier of African American accomplishments. In 1927, she was the first African American to be admitted to Barnard College. After graduation, Zora immediately set out to explore “Negro” folklore. Through her strong determination and interest- and after only a few months- Zora had amassed the largest collection of “Negro” folk tales in her field. She used her extensive research into African American life and history to construct plays which recalled traditional “Negro folk-lore.” One such play is her famous <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, an adaptation of <em>The Great day</em>, a theatrical revue- a theatrical performance involving short satirical and topical songs, sketches, and monologues- written in 1932.","Zora frequently worked with Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida to construct and perform her creations. The concert program of “Negro music” for <em>The Great Day </em>was built through Zora’s collaborative effort with the creative literature department of Rollins College. The John Golden Theatre on Broadway housed the first performance of <em>The Great Day</em> on January 10, 1932- Zora had made it to Broadway. On February 11, 1933, she staged an adaptation of <em>The Great Day</em> called <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, “a program of original Negro folk-lore,” at Rollins College with “Native Negro Singers and Actors.” The event program included a brief biography about Zora Hurston, an outline of the play, and specific descriptions and explanations of each song included in the revue. At 8:15 pm, “Negroes” and “white friends of the Negroes” gathered at Rollins’ Recreation Hall to “experience the richness of the material at their own doorstep.” The play was a success, as many college and local newspaper write-ups from the period suggest, and Zora continued to display her creations at Rollins in front of captive audiences for years to come.","Though she fought and stood against racial prejudice throughout her life, Zora Neale Hurston stands as one of America’s most celebrated authors.  Zora’s creative path began in Eatonville, and by the mid 30s, it brought her to all the way to Broadway. Her story stands to tell: Zora indeed took her mother’s advice to “jump at de sun.\""],"display_date":"1910 - 1935","search_date":"1922-12-31","locations":[{"id":16531,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":129,"tag":"Eatonville"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4850,"title":"Work In An All-Black Community","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/46","end_date":"1/5/46","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zora Neale Hurston was an African American woman born in the first all African American town in America.  She wrote countless accounts of different things she saw and experienced and this is very important because what she experienced was completely different than what most other African Americans experienced.  In the short story “Turpentine” she accounts when she walks down to see where the people were building the road.  She explains how the people built the road, what they were paid and how they felt about the work.  Zora Neale Hurston’s ideas and thoughts on African American culture in this time period is unique because of her upbringing, making her very important to African American historians.","In this story it is prevalent that all the workers are African Americans.  She speaks of the smells and her thoughts almost like a diary and this gives historians an inside look at the way African Americans felt about hard work.  The whole time there is a very positive feel to the document and I feel that this is important because it shows that the people were happy to work and glad to be getting paid for their labor even if it was “a penny per tree cut” (turpentine1) which means for every tree cleared out of the way they were collectively rewarded a penny.","Throughout her life Hurston never experienced the same kind of prejudices that most other Africans face.  She speaks of Eatonville as a sort of utopia in which African Americans could exist without the prejudices of a white dominated society.  This is what makes her accounts of history so special.  The fact that she was able to grow up in this African American society and then assimilate later in life gave her a perspective only a small portion of the rest of the world shared.  That is why she was able to stand up for African Americans in Harlem and assist so greatly in the Harlem renaissance.  This view of the world was so obtuse to other recollections that she was even shut out by many African American historians.  “Although her works stand among the richest documentary in life, labor, and culture.  Most of the denunciation of her work has come from the intellectual left, which has accused her of ignoring of minimizing the exploitation, oppression and outright atrocities visited upon black people in the post-reconstruction south” (Zora Neale Hurston and the history of southern life 10).","This account is important because of the perspective brought upon it by Hurston.  Her background and upbringing changed her view on African American society.  This change is seen here with the very positive account of a very negative job.  Taring roads is supposedly one of the worst jobs because of the danger heat and smell of the tar.  She recounts the people calling it “gum patch” which brings on a positive feel.  These accounts are so very important today because it reassures people that not every African American lived a horrible life.","Zora Neale Hurston was an influential woman not just because of her presence in the Harlem renaissance but her accounts and recollections of the time she spent in and around other African Americans.  This look into the past through her eyes can help people learn about the good times African Americans had in the post-reconstructed south.  Her positive writings about this account show that her life and the lives of the people around her were not all bad.  Not only is just a positive account but also shows the construction and expansion African American culture because of the road construction.  Much can be learned from Zora Neale Hurston and her accounts for history are worth their weight in gold."],"display_date":"January 1, 1946 -

Journeying along through the early twentieth century, this chain of schools based their education off the Tuskegee institute under the guidance and teachings of the profound educator named Booker T. Washington. One study that is not touched on enough or regarded highly throughout African American history, is the surrounding question of how were these industrial institutions in the south able to stay afloat financially to support their education for young African Americans during the time of segregation between White and Black schools?","There is a lot of first-hand evidence from the Robert Hungerford industrial school’s Fourth Annual Report, written in 1903 to the Board of Trustees principal Russell C. Calhoun, on the basis of funding. This annual report included a thank you letter from Principal Calhoun  to the Board of Trustees, thanking them for their contributions. Additionally, Principle Calhoun speaks about the progression of the industrial school in 1903 and ask for assistance in the expansion the institution into the future.","To give a rough estimate, based off the letter from Principal Calhoun to the Board of Trustees, the industrial school’s populace counted up to 105 students. Also, the school also taught 12 different trades such as Blacksmithing, Wheelwrighting, Carpentry, Farming, Cooking, Sewing, Laundering, Poultry Raising and Dairying. To support the teaching upon these trades the property sat on 200 acres of land with one Dormitory. Amongst these acres of land, the amount of shops, tools, and livestock altogether accumulated up to $5,286.75. As the industrial institution expanded in later years, we deduce that a great deal of support was needed within the different areas of funding from different organizations or entities in the rural south. Yet is had difficulty finding the much needed support.","When it came to funding education for minorities in the United States, especially for African American schools in the north and south, they traditionally received the shorter end of the stick when compared to White schools. It is worth noting that much of the funds for African American education came from black communal efforts such as churches and intuitive finances. Separate funding was given within the terms of segregation and fell in line with the distribution of local real estate taxes. The south found ways to avoid paying these taxes and authorized local school authorities to handle the circulation of funds between African American and White schools that were supported by State legislatures. State legislatures were notoriously known for underfunding city schools, which is still prevalent to this day, especially within the African American community.","In viewing African American education from a broad scope, we can see that there was much inequality in the funding platform provided by the white community. This situation happened in both the north and south but it was considerably more prominent in the south. Slightly shifting our focus to the topic of campaigns especially towards the Northern Campaigns. The southern industrial institutions, such as the Robert Hungerford industrial school, set up “Northern Campaigns” to raise from 3,000 to 30,000 dollars through daily written appeals from the southern institution’s trusted representatives. These appeals were sent to white charity groups in an effort to obtain their support for the education platform that these southern industrial institutions had to offer.","Through these grueling and difficult efforts to receive some type of financial support, African American educators had to compete against sales groups who tirelessly searched for reformation with crusades and quarterly settlements from northern philanthropic funding. Although most African American southern industrial institutions lost a vital avenue into the northern philanthropic trusted funding, there were some successes such as Hampton University and Tuskegee Institute. Northern Philanthropists used the success of these southern African American industrial institutions with the thought that these southern educational institutions were enormously financially supported.","James H. Dillard, southern white educational activist connected with many philanthropic activities, once declared that twenty-five percent of northern money for black education \"might better be sunk into the Potomac River before it comes over.”"," There were also false claims for donations for industrial schools that never existed in the south. In 1912, there were seventeen industrial institutions aided by the government, 15 were located in the south, but none African American. Soon enough African American industrial schools in the south were quickly sending appeals to the North. ","The reason for the written appeals were to show the humility and consistency of the importance that African American fund raisers and educators to northern philanthropist about the success of their schools. . The following from James S. Russell, Principal of the St. Paul, Virginia, Normal and Industrial School to New York investment banker George Foster Peabody, was representative: “In overalls, with plows, mattocks, hoes, and other implements, our agricultural students may be seen today adding two hundred acres of low lands to the present acreage; milking cows; caring for the swine; truck gardening; putting in the winter cover crops, etc. In the workshops, building wagons, buggies, shoeing horses, making harness.... In the classroom like bees getting the fundamental requisites for trades.... So great is the sacrifice and earnestness of these poor boys and girls that they justly deserve ... the sympathy and support of all persons interested in human struggles.”","African American educators and fund raisers proved their passion and support to the industrial education for black males and females by reaching out and speaking in campaigns, meetings, and publications to Northern philanthropists. In these publications, they emphasized that southern industrial schools will have a remarkable benefit to the African American community in the rural south through the many trades that it taught and had to offer. Religion also played a vital role in the Northern Campaigns since it was highly valued among northern white philanthropists as well. Consequently, black educators emphasized and incorporated the importance of God and Christianity for attending African American students in these Northern Campaigns.","The 1915 Northern Campaigns were considered successful in funding as a whole. Although defining success might be different from school to school. Due to WWI, different complications between the philanthropic community and poorly planned events may have created problems in the funding campaigning. The Robert Hungerford industrial school resolved in 1909 and was considered one of the most successfully funded. There were other smaller African American industrial schools that faced financial burdens as they try to establish themselves into the future of the black southern industrial institutions."],"display_date":"1900 - 1915","search_date":"1908-01-01","locations":[{"id":52904,"lat":28.6147216,"lng":-81.3806249,"zoom":8,"place":"Eatonville,Fl"},{"id":52903,"lat":28.4844995,"lng":-81.2518833,"zoom":8,"place":"Orange County, Fl"}],"tags":[{"id":2962,"tag":"1900-1915"},{"id":2961,"tag":"Industrial Schools"},{"id":2960,"tag":"Northern Campaigns"},{"id":2959,"tag":"Fl"},{"id":1237,"tag":"Tuskegee"},{"id":1133,"tag":"Booker T.
