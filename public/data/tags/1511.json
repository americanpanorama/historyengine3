He would head north on New York Avenue from the Winter Park Post Office, turn right onto West Canton Avenue, left onto North Interlachen Avenue, right on North Park Avenue, another right on East Stovin Avenue until he finally took his last right turn onto Palmer Avenue. Once he reached Palmer he would continue his travels throughout the neighborhood. Everyday, Charles Thomas Anderson would embark on this journey, but not in an automobile, he would embark on this journey by foot, no matter what the weather forecast predicted. Charles Thomas Anderson was a mailman and this was his journey to work.[1]","Charles Thomas Anderson was not always a mailman. He was born in 1917 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky where he claimed his residence until December 1941 when Japan attacked the American military base Pearl Harbor, leading to the United States joining World War II and Anderson joining the cause. After serving as Master Sergeant in the Air Force, Anderson’s life would be forever changed due to the G.I. Bill. This bill made it easier for veterans to own more land more than ever before, specifically in the suburbs.[2] The suburbs were a place where these veterans could raise their baby booming families with a white picket fence and achieve the American dream. The suburb was a passport to consistency, community, and safety. Just as getting to work was important, so was the initial move into the suburbs.[3] For Anderson, in particular, the suburbs of Florida, where lower taxes and tropical weather made this American dream an even better reality, was the ideal place to call home.","Charles Thomas Anderson sought to maintain this dream through employment, employment he found at the Winter Park post office. There from 1955 until he retired in 1974 Anderson became the “Whistling Postman.”[4] His route encompassed Palmer Avenue through Via Bella, but he took this daily journey with pleasure. Charles Thomas Anderson’s daily commute was much more than a journey to work; it was a story of the American dream."," ","[1] \"Funeral Notice- Charles Thomas Anderson,\" <em>The Orlando Sentinel</em>, January 15, 2006.","[2] Suzanne Metler, \"The Creation of the G.I.

The Myers had three children and the house in Levittown had everything they wanted. Daisy recounted, “it was a rancher with a third bedroom for our baby girl, a garage for Bill, and a yard for the children to play in.” However, excited as she was about her new home, Daisy maintained apprehensions over the social consequences her move might provoke. “Numb on the outside,” and filled with anxiety on the inside, Daisy approached her new community with a mind full of doubt. The same day a crowd of people formed in front of the Myers’ front door. Soon the crowd grew into a mob filled with racist protestors, reporters, and curious onlookers. The barrage of intimidating questions and racial slurs from the crowd was a source of great stress for the Myers: “Bill had to see the doctor several times during the crisis; each time the diagnosis was nervous tension,” Daisy remembered. Eventually the questions and slurs escalated to violence and threats of death. At the peak of its madness the mob had to be beaten back from the Myers home by policemen with riot sticks. However, Daisy contended that the mob outside her house did not represent the majority of Levittowners. In fact, she claimed the Myers received supportive letters from many Levittowners, along with people from all over the world. People empathized with their situation and pleaded with them to stick it out. “These letters” Daisy stated, “were a treasure to us; Bill and I read them with deep satisfaction and treasured each one.”  ","Historian Alexander Miller confirms Daisy’s sentiments in his analysis of the incident: “The good, kind, decent people in Levittown, of whom there are many” he contends, “are ineffectual in the face of violence other than to voice support for law and order.” Even so, the good people who represented the majority were overshadowed by racist counter parts. Levittowns were a place of “racial homogeneity” Miller concedes. Thus, it was no surprise that the arrival of a black family would create unrest. Furthermore, according to Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, William Levitt himself was a white flight pioneer. He created primarily white Levittowns for people who wanted to move away from cities for a number of motives including distancing themselves from African Americans. The result was that blacks were generally excluded from the suburban life that characterized the American dream of the 1950s. Furthermore, for those like the Myers who did manage to make it to the suburbs, to live in a house, as Daisy put it, with a yard for the kids; a garage for the husband; and a garden for flowers, their dream would be under constant threat of turning into a nightmare."],"display_date":"August 19, 1957 - August 31, 1957","search_date":"1957-08-25","locations":[{"id":52867,"lat":40.4107964,"lng":-75.2479061,"zoom":2,"place":"Bucks County, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":2878,"tag":"Suburbia"},{"id":1511,"tag":"American Dream"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}}]}
