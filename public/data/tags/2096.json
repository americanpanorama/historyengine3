When well-to-do citizens formed the exposition company, they imagined a fair that would marry agriculture and industry in a world class exposition. By early 1889, the exposition company had a capital stock of $500,000 to draw on, and the Detroit International Fair and Exposition became a reality.","Seventy two acres of unincorporated land where the Detroit and Rouge Rivers met, just south of Fort Wayne were chosen to host the fair. The countryside was valued at $150,000, and had long been enjoyed by canoeists, fishermen, and hunters.","The goal of the exposition was not only to showcase the city and state, but to draw attention to Detroit and boost its stature among other great cities. The advertisements for the fair struck this chord. Touted as the most handsome grounds in the world, little Delray to the southwest of Detroit was built up magnificently. There were to be wonderful displays of electric inventions and manufactures, as well as the \"finest blooded horses and cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry. Railcars and ferries pulled up right to the shores, \"beautifully located on the bank of the Detroit River.\"","Several important points can be drawn from these sources. One, the Solvay Process Company would go on to buy and build its factory on this very location. The easy access to the water, prelaid rail, and a city warm to industry all set this in motion. Two, the area exploded around the expostition, and the village of Delray would be incorporated, shortly after the annual fair halted, in 1897. Three, the fair was a harmony of agriculture and industry, in a beautiful area. In the decades after the fair Delray would itself change into industry and housing, and smokestacks would tower over a landscape that fair gowers and fisherman had enjoyed."],"display_date":1899,"search_date":"1899-07-02","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2096,"tag":"International Fair"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5969,"title":"Detroit International Exposition Fair of 1889: Delray Before Its Industries","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-17","end_date":"1889-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","<em>Harpers Weekly</em> devoted a large part of its August 17, 1889 issue to the upcoming Detroit International Exposition Fair, which would open exactly one month later on September 17, 1889. Included in their spread was an engraving by Francis Schell and Thomas Hogan, bearing the caption, “General View of the Buildings and Grounds of the Detroit International Fair and Exposition.”  The engraving is of an aerial view of the Main Building, several pavilions adjacent to it, and two long ponds. These grand projects were built just southwest of Fort Wayne in Delray, and according to the engraving would be surrounded by bustling activity around the pavilions as well as significant boat traffic along the river, presumably bringing in hoards of tourists eager to visit the fair. The main building was designed by Louis Kamper in style that recalls great European palaces, and was prominently placed at the center axis of the engraving and at an angle that dramatically accentuated its long, ornamented halls.  The <em>Harpers </em>article points out proudly that it was “the largest building in the world erected exclusively for fair and exposition purposes,” and goes on to boast of the plethora of industries and activities that would be represented, from packaged seeds to stove manufacturers to musicians and a painting gallery with 300 artworks. The fair would be so large that the author said the only person capable of seeing everything in a day would have to be a “professional pedestrian.”","The event jumpstarted major construction projects in Delray. The city transformed the area by draining marshlands, clearing farms, building new roads and railways, and even constructing two additional docks to accommodate the anticipated increase in river-traffic.  The fair happened at a time when Detroit was bursting with economic and industrial activity and this event solidified its reputation as a booming city. The fair did draw a lot of attention, but afterwards, the structures did not remain. Delray also did not maintain this palatial appearance. Within just six years, the Solvey Processing Plant took over the location of the main exposition building and began to dig for salt.  If we were take an aerial shot from the same spot today as where Schell and Hogan did their engraving in 1889, instead of seeing the grand halls by Kamper, we would be peering down onto the black land and factories of Zug Island."],"display_date":"August 17, 1889 - September 17, 1889","search_date":"1889-09-01","locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2096,"tag":"International Fair"},{"id":2054,"tag":"Zug Island"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5996,"title":"Delray Property Owners Welcome the International Fair of 1889","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-05-08","end_date":"1889-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Detroit International Exposition and Fair Project of 1889 was an exciting year for all of Delray. Pre-automobile industry times allowed room for diverse businesses, a glowing point well showcased in the Exposition. The fair was a healthy combination of agricultural and industrial. Displays of livestock, musicians, art galleries, and new technology surrounded the exposition’s main building, the biggest infrastructure at its time. Among the excited were Delray property owners. Extending Delray’s boundaries and incorporation of the village has already been on the village’s property owners’ agenda. The owners believed that the Exposition will bring considerable property value increases and help their plan along. Expansion of Delray’s boundary would include all the territory north of Fort Street, the east of the city, south by the Detroit River, and west by the River Rouge. Street improvements and a town hall are also part of the plan. With several hundred thousand people projected to walk the streets of Delray during the 10 day exposition in September of 1889, Delray property owners are confident about the execution of such plans for the village. However, the proponents are met with formidable opposition by those concerned about tax increases and poor return on investment. With or without the expansion and incorporation of Delray, the International Fair marked Detroit's industrial growth and growing economic prosperity in an appropriately grandiose fashion. As one of the last horse carriages were drawn down Woodward Avenue, rapid industrial growth awaited Detroit in the 20th century."],"display_date":"May 8, 1889 - September 27, 1889","search_date":"1889-07-18","locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2096,"tag":"International Fair"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"},{"id":2121,"tag":"Property Value"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
