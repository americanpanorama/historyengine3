Beginning work in the coal mines in DuBois, PA, John faced dire circumstances both down in the mines and above ground: whatever wages he earned were owed to the company store for sustenance before he even resurfaced with his pay. Given an opportunity to escape the mines, John moved to Detroit as an auto factory worker, promised a \"magnificent sum of $5 a day.\" Leading up to the Depression, as auto company layoffs and changeovers began, John harbored dreams of staring a grocery store, a dream to which he came one step closer when he began renting a candy shop on Hanson and Cicotte. Shortly after, John was finally able to take up renting a \"grocery-butcher shop with living quarters,\" fulfilling his dream. Working from 6:45 AM to 9:45 PM, John loved every moment and created a \"village meeting place\" equipped with the only telephone in the area. John even began extending credit to local patrons and ended every transaction with \"a little schnapps\" and a candy bar for each of the men's children. John was happy, and \"everyone was happy,\" until rationing and shortages brought on by the Second World War forced him to close the store and return to factory work. Though John never fully regained the losses from the outstanding credit, John remained \"happy and optimistic\" since he had \"achieved his dream, lived a good life, and loved his country with a passion.\"","John's fierce optimism and devotion to his community was characteristic of the time period as Sidney Fine writes in his biography of Frank Murphy. He describes the \"widespread belief in the United States before 1929 that a person who wished to work could find employment,\" a sentiment that is exhibited by John's dreams to leave a steady position and risk opening his own store. Frank Murphy, the mayor of Detroit leading up to and during the Great Depression, believed that citizens of Detroit should expect that their government should aid those in distress due to unemployment, stating that \"no one in this great city of plenty...must be allowed to go hungry, or cold, or unhoused, or unclothed.\" This belief led Murphy to start the Mayor's Unemployment Committee (MUC) to help to address issues of unemployement by sharing the importance of the issue with the whole community and framing the issue in a new light. MUC went on to establish several new programs, once of which was the Detroit thrift-gardens, a program that echoed the work of Hazen Pingree and his \"potato patches.\" In addition to providing much-needed food to the unemployed, Murphy believed that \"the psychological effect of idleness of large groups of our people...[is] dangerous to the safety and morale of the country\" and that the projects could help to cultivate work ethic for the unemployed. Though originally unsuccessful, the project eventually proved to provide work for the unemployed and allowed them to stay mentally and physically fit until they found another job while contributing to the greater community."],"display_date":"1925 - 1935","search_date":"1930-07-02","locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"},{"id":21832,"lat":41.000231092,"lng":-78.474128629,"zoom":9,"place":"Clearfield, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1978,"tag":"Unemployment"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"},{"id":1908,"tag":"Garden"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5982,"title":"Future of Detroit: From Blight to Bloom","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/99","end_date":"12/31/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Malik Yakini, a Detroit native, was born mid-century during the hight of the city’s production power.  Around 1960, after the “white flight” movement, Yakini and his family experienced frequent hostility when they moved into a predominantly white neighborhood. Racial discrimination persisted as economic opportunity began to crumble.  Yet, within a few years, the community transformed into having a primarily African-American population.  In the decades after his family’s move and neighborhood changes, Yakini remembers the slow decline in public services, ranging from mass transit to garbage collection to fire fighting.  Today, over 80 percent of Detroit’s population is African-American and the unemployment rate stands at about 15 percent.","Now, Yakini is the chairman of the Detroit Black Food Security Network and in charge of several urban farm and gardening projects.  He believes that Detroit may be revitalized through food production, since its food production capacity is so immense. The city is spread over 360 acres and contains an estimated 150,000 abandoned parcels, causing officials to believe that the farming could clean up blight and grow jobs.  With the emergence of a local food-processing industry, 4,700 jobs and $20 million in taxes could be created.  By 2050, 29 percent of Detroit’s landscape would be allocated to farming, something that has gained the attention of prosperous landowners and entrepreneurs.","Yakini sees these changes being brought about by the community, going beyond the economics of urban farming. He thinks that the most important aspect of public gardens and farming is that it will tie people together for the common good.  He states, “African-Americans in Detroit tend to have a sense of despair and helplessness that is a direct result of oppression. Producing even some of our own food restores a sense of power, a sense that we can shape our own destiny.”  The future of Detroit not only relies on community leaders like Yakini, but also on the history that has shaped its current state."],"display_date":1999,"search_date":"1999-07-02","locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2052,"tag":"Urban Farming"},{"id":1978,"tag":"Unemployment"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
