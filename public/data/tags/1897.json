Although the synthetic rubber had not progressed as much in the laboratories, the plant-built “wool” had, appearing to be comparable with natural wool.  The material, intending to be used for upholstery fabrics, was allegedly the first to be produced from vegetable protein.  After years of research, the soy-based wool served many purposes, supplementing the country’s wool crop, and may have even met the war-time demand for the material.","Due to the Great Depression, most of Ford’s research took place during that time period. He soon came to believe that the practical use of soybeans would become influential in the role of lifting America out of the depression. Throughout the following few years during the early 1930s, Ford worked with researchers and the agriculture industry to produce soy products, such as paint and small plastic car parts.  He also created a new market for farmers, offering them a new source of income.  From the late 1930s until his death in 1947, Ford was recognized as a major soybean pioneer, making outstanding achievements during his declining years."],"display_date":"June 4, 1942","search_date":"1942-06-04","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1900,"tag":"Automotive Industry"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1898,"tag":"Soybean"},{"id":1897,"tag":"Henry Ford"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6024,"title":"Soybean and Weeds Sandwiches: George Washington Carver and Henry Ford at the Tuskegee Institute","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"7/22/42","end_date":"7/22/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 22nd 1942, George Washington Carver, an African American scientist, visited his friend and fellow innovator, Henry Ford, at the Ford Nutritional Laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan. Carver and Ford were old friends, having met 10 years prior and establishing a friendship based on Ford's interest in Carver's work at the Tuskegee Institute, where Carver experimented with agricultural raw material sources for industrial products. Having visited each other several times, Ford and Carver formed a deep friendship. One time, when Ford heard that Carver had fallen ill and was having trouble climbing the stairs, Ford sent Carver an elevator to be installed in his home.","Believing that war brought an opportunity for Americans to utilize natural resources in a new way, Carver introduced Ford and his researchers to many different new products and recipes that could be produced out of agriculture. For example, Carver offered up soybean and weeds sandwiches, which, though fairly bland, were still surprisingly edible. Carver’s other ideas included axel grease, wood stain, ice cream, and dandruff cures from peanuts, fertilizer from swamp muck, and roadways from cotton.","Ford was drawn to Carver’s ideas, especially one for a synthetic rubber, since they both believed that the American farm was at the core of industry. They had previously worked together to create “chemurgy,” a new branch of science that merged agriculture and industry. Both Carver and Ford had a passion for conservation and believed that farmers and industrial society played an important part in the society and should not be lost to industrialization. Though Carver had been born into slavery, had bought his freedom with an old racehorse, and had the uncommon privilege to able to educate himself, he and Ford championed education for those in the South, believing that green industry, education, and agriculture were a harmonious engine for democracy. By working on projects such as conservation, waste elimination, recycling, and alternative, agricultural sourcing for industrial products, Carver and Ford set forth a legacy that continues today."],"display_date":"July 22, 1942","search_date":"1942-07-22","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1897,"tag":"Henry Ford"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6025,"title":"Pleasurable Excursions on the Expansive Detroit River","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Advertisements published in the mid-nineteenth century offered \"pleasurable excursions\" on the Detroit River for visitors, tourists, and/or city-dwellers who were looking to escape the city scenery in exchange for the natural vistas that the Detroit River offers. The excursions were multiple-day long trips on steamships along the river, and offered voyages to major cities and waterways in the Great Lakes area.","Such excursions offer a glimpse into the complicated nature of the tourist industry of Detroit around the year 1863 - before the auto industry, but during the age of industrialization and immigration when lumber, metal, and minerals traveled south into the city and immigrants eager for work in the new industries flooded in from the east coast. Wealthy visitors to Detroit marvelled at the great industrial accomplishments in the city, which was advertised with large smokestacks and innovative technologies (during this time period, people weren't as aware of the dangers of pollution and the effect of industry on the environment). When tourists came to Detroit, they often wanted to see both the industrial, urban life and also the expansive scenery of the surrounding \"wilderness\" that the Michigan area had to offer.","This combination of industry and nature has echoes in the ideas later espoused by Henry Ford (although he was only just a baby when this was printed) about the need for city inhabitants to be able to \"escape\" from the city into the countrysie, where they could enjoy their surroundings. Tourists visiting Detroit weren't the only clients that this advertisement was aiming for - city inhabitants would have also been eager to take a \"pleasurable excursion\" down the Detroit River to explore the scenic nature that existed outside of the industrial city scene."," "],"display_date":1863,"search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":6596,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2108,"tag":"Steamboats"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1897,"tag":"Henry Ford"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
