She created a precedent not only by representing her state in the Senate, but by being the first woman to deliver a speech on the Congress floor. “Miss Dixie”, as she was affectionately called, spoke against an anti-lynching bill. Southern women often talked about lynching, because they considered it a necessary prosecution to avoid rape; so it was not surprising that Senator Graves talked passionately about the subject. Lynching was a well-discussed subject during the New Deal Era of the 1930s, because the Great Depression and its repercussions had caused a new wave of lynching throughout the South. Congress had introduced various anti-lynching bills before and during the Progressive Era, but none could pass through the filibuster initiated by Southern Congressmen. By the 1930s, most mob violence and lynchings were directed against African Americans in the South; however, Senator Graves’s speech did not mention this. Instead, she argued that the frequency of lynching was declining and Southern states had the right to deal with it in their own way. She insisted that the lynching problem did not need governmental intervention and federal legislation, and states were “stamping out this disease”.","The speech became the subject of differing viewpoints and countless newspaper articles throughout the country. One such article from <em>The Birmingham News</em> praises Senator Graves and points out that “even Vice President Garner listened when [she] had her say about lynching”. The article even mentions that after the female senator was done with her speech, Republicans and Democrats from both sides of the isle stood up to shake her hand. Whether these events were true or not, many Southern newspapers like the <em>Tuscaloosa News</em> and the M<em>ontgomery Advisor</em> delivered similar articles acknowledging and praising Senator Graves. Northern newspapers, however, were not as kind. The newly appointed senator’s speech contained a number of erroneous facts, and to Northerners, she seemed to be defending the practice of lynching. Some Northern articles drew attention to her gender as a way of discrediting Miss Dixie Graves. One paper mocked her husband, Governor Graves, by saying that Mrs. Graves “can’t be a very good cook. Otherwise her husband, Bibb, would never have appointed her to the Senate”.","Dixie Graves followed in the footsteps of other women in Alabama and the South who were gaining more public roles since 1900. Historian Mary Martha Thomas writes, “although they were excluded from positions of political power, women compensated by activity in their various organizations”. Following the Progressive Era, women began moving from domestic life into public life; they established temperance societies, women’s suffrage clubs, and other organizations that were meant to bring attention to social issues. Through these organizations, women put pressure on the government to eliminate child labor, attack illiteracy, improve the school system, provide welfare for the sick and elderly, and allow women to vote. Although Miss Dixie’s speech to Congress represented women’s newly acquired confidence in public life, it was neither forward-looking in its subject matter, nor did it demonstrate any progress in the South's approval of racial equality."],"display_date":"August 20, 1937","search_date":"1937-08-20","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2264,"tag":"senator graves"},{"id":2263,"tag":"governor Graves"},{"id":2262,"tag":"female senator"},{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":1972,"tag":"1930s"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6111,"title":"<strong>Vote to Make the Lady Our Appellate Judge!</strong>","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"5/4/52","end_date":"5/4/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 4th, 1952, readers of <em>The Florence Times</em> opened the newspaper and flipped through the pages to find various political advertisements. One such ad asked readers to vote in the Democratic Primary for Annie Lola Price to replace herself as a judge on the Alabama Court of Appeals. The ad featured a small picture of the lady herself, as well as a short description of Judge Price’s accomplishments. The endorsement read “Judge Price has not been reversed in a single case by the Supreme Court of Alabama”. It did not mention, however, that the lady being endorsed was the first female judge on the Appellate Court of Alabama.","Annie Lola Price never attended law school, but after reading law while she was a secretary at a law firm, she passed the Alabama bar exam. She began practicing law but soon rose to become legal advisor to Governor James E. Folsom. From there he appointed her to serve on the Court of Appeals. She feared that she may not be welcomed on the Court as a woman and chose to take her oath in a private office instead of taking part in a swearing-in ceremony. She received some criticism from Alabama’s newspapers due to her gender. An article in the <em>Montgomery Advisor</em> said that her appointment to the court was “jarring to the legal profession”. She was criticized for not having real judicial experience in trying a case, although, she had attended numerous trials as a part-time court reporter.","At the time <em>The Florence Times</em> printed its advertisement asking voters to vote for Judge Price, she had been serving on the Court for sixteen months. Other candidates for political offices appeared in the newspaper that day, including C. C. (Jack) Cole for Public Service Commission, whose ad appeared shamelessly eleven times in the newspaper. Judge Price’s photo and endorsement, however, appeared only once in the Social and Club Activities section of the newspaper. This section featured women’s activities in church or other organizations, and it was usually written to cater to women’s interests. Judge Price was not exclusively looking for the female vote, but the editors of the newspaper seemed to feel that the female section was where her advertisement was most suited. Nonetheless, Judge Price defeated three male opponents for her seat in the primary and went on to win the runoffs. She earned the respect and admiration of her fellow judges on the Court and served for over twenty years as Chief Justice on the Criminal Court of Appeals.","Annie Price was a remarkable woman, as women had much difficulty succeeding in the legal profession in the 1950s. Female lawyers were paid less and valued less than their male counterparts, which is why women were not made partners at law firms until the 1970s. During the Second World War, firms had no choice but to hire women, with men serving overseas. However, after men returned from the War, women were released from legal counseling jobs. Judge Price’s career was much unlike those of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor or current Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Both women graduated from prestigious law schools in the 1950s, and had difficulty finding jobs other than secretarial positions at law firms. Alabama’s Judge Price was able to achieve with a steady voice and calm attitude what took other judges years to accomplish."],"display_date":"May 4, 1952","search_date":"1952-05-04","locations":[{"id":30385,"lat":34.9015275542,"lng":-87.6543722425,"zoom":10,"place":"Lauderdale, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":2265,"tag":"judge"},{"id":2266,"tag":"female judge"},{"id":2267,"tag":"Annie Lola Price"},{"id":2268,"tag":"women in legal profession"},{"id":2269,"tag":"appellate judge"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6613,"title":"Her American Dream: Shirley Chisholm for President","course_id":163,"status":"P","start_date":"12/24/71","end_date":"12/24/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the night of December 24, 1971, New York City mayor John V. Lindsay invited the congresswoman from Brooklyn, Shirley Chisholm, to his mansion. Progressive politicians across the country worried about the split in voters if the three potential candidates continued their campaigns for president. Lindsay took it upon himself to convince Chisholm to drop out of the race in order to not draw the black vote away from himself, or from South Dakota Senator, George McGovern. However, the congresswoman remained intent on her goal to shine a spotlight on the corruption and foot dragging of white, male politicians. She fired back, “If you’re so worried about cutting into the progressive vote, why don’t you and McGovern get together - and one of you decide to back out?” Chisholm saw herself as a representative of the American Dream, a black woman making a run for the most powerful position in the country.","Shirley Chisholm became the first black female congresswoman in 1968. After winning her congressional seat, Chisholm stated, “I will fight until I can’t fight anymore. I don’t mind the challenge.” As a congresswoman, she remained outspoken. Her maiden speech to Congress was against spending in Vietnam, and in it she argued that war funding should be redirected to attack hunger and poverty. Chisholm saw fit to hire a largely female staff in order to provide more opportunities for advancement for women in politics. She also sat as an honorary President of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. Chisholm stood out as a symbol for the black, working class district that voted for her because she never lost touch with her constituency. She argued that the major problem with Congress was that politicians feared sacrificing their political careers in order to stand up for the people they represented. Her independence and reputation as a spitfire left her without many allies in government, so she passed little legislation. However, as historian Julie Gallagher notes, Chisholm chose to fight what she saw as a stagnant system from the inside out.","Chisholm was a symbol of political success for many across the country. She eventually chose to run for president to break the mold. She ran in order to show that an African American woman could make a serious attempt at taking the highest office in the country. The political climate created by social movements of the 1960s and 1970s primed Chisholm’s candidacy, along with her ability to identify with those around her. While she received the endorsement of the Black Panther Party, most black leadership and women’s organizations offered little more than verbal encouragement to her campaign. As a powerful figure to minority groups, multiple interest groups tried to own her and her candidacy in order to bring national attention to their cause. However, Chisholm resisted the ownership of interest groups. She continued in her campaign as an independent exposing the problems with status quo politics. This independence contributed to her defeat by Senator George McGovern for the 1972 Democratic nomination."],"display_date":"December 24, 1971","search_date":"1971-12-24","locations":[{"id":52987,"lat":40.776058,"lng":-73.9430817,"zoom":11,"place":"Gracie Mansion, New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":1561,"tag":"1972 Election"},{"id":1519,"tag":"Shirley Chisholm"},{"id":2021,"tag":"African American history"}],"course":{"name":"History of U.S. Presidential Elections","school":"Wayne State University","course_id":163,"school_id":92}}]}
