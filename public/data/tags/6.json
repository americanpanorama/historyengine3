1845, the public mind of Louisiana had decided that the state's current constitution, constructed in 1812, was too outmoded and contained too prominent elements of an aristocratic mindset.  The Jacksonian idea of equal ability of all' and the Democratic Party's characterization of the common man' was pervasive, while the wealthy landowners and aristocrats still in existence became entrenched in the opposition Whig party.  In January of 1845, a new Constitutional Convention for Louisiana met in New Orleans; progress was slow while citizens expressed their thoughts and hopes for the new Constitution: If tardiness of progress be a characteristic of great bodies, it is an attribute of greatness to which the Convention may justly lay claim.  Thus far their motion has been particularly slow , a snail-pace gait; but it is to be hoped that when rules for the government of their proceedings are adopted, and when, having erected their scaffolding, they set about in good sooth, to build up the new Constitution, the work will proceed more rapidly, and when executed be worthy of the architects who undertook the enterprise, and of the State, the monument of whose wisdom and the temple of whose liberty it is at once designed to be.'","This new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 embodied the Jacksonian ideals and feel.  It sharply restricted the power of the state to lend money and forbade the state from becoming a stockholder; it also prohibited lotteries, dueling, legislative divorces, the official granting of monopolies, and restricted the state's power to issue charters.  The new Louisiana Constitution of 1845 eliminated property holding requirements for holding public office, and established total population (including free whites, voteless free blacks and slaves) for the use of apportionment in the state senate, while the state house of representatives was still apportioned by voter population.  The new constitution also made strides in the state sector of education by creating the office of superintendent of public education and by pushing the legislature to establish public schools.  In the sector of justice, the courts were improved significantly and for the first time, felons under sentences of death or life in prison could appeal to the state Supreme Court."],"display_date":"January 14, 1845","search_date":"1845-01-14","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":109,"title":"Southern Baptist Convention Formed by 293 Representatives of Churches in the Southeastern U.S.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-05-08","end_date":"1845-05-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, a group of Southern Baptists broke away from the Triennial Convention and the American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS) due to differences on the slavery issue.  This particular group of Southern Baptists did not oppose slavery, as the Triennial Convention and the ABHMS had begun to do.  The Baptist Board, situated in Boston, in November of 1844, adopted certain resolutions, one of which stated that if, however, any one should offer himself as a missionary, having slaves, and insist on retaining them as his property, we could not appoint him.  One thing is certain, we can never be a party to any arrangement which would imply approbation of slavery.'&lt;br /&gt;293 delegates from local churches, state conventions, educational institutions, and missionary societies met in Augusta, Georgia, and formed the Southern Baptist Convention, which was led by W. B. Johnson, a pastor from South Carolina.  Although the Northern Baptists (ABHMS) recognized the right of the Southern branch to break away, they described it as a hugely important and momentous act: They have severed, with one blow, the union which has so long existed.  They had united with the North for no prescribed or certain period.  The union was to last during pleasure, and during pleasure only.  The South, therefore, had a right for any cause, or for no cause, to separate from the North.  Still, to sever ties by which the parties had been so long bound together, to draw a dividing line between North and South, was a solemn and momentous act.  It was a deed not to be rashly or hastily done.  No man can calculate the extent of the influence which this single act may exert, not only upon the great work of imparting Christianity to the heathen, but upon the interests, or even the existence, of our common country.'  Geographically restricted to states that would eventually become the Confederacy, the SBC began in 1845 with a total membership of 351,951 in 4,126 local Baptist churches.  The SBC version of the Baptist Church was shaped by early westward migration and life on the trans-Appalachian frontier, an agrarian mode of life, was mainly linked to the common people' and ideas of individualism, and held a strong commitment to missions."],"display_date":"May 8, 1845 - May 12, 1845","search_date":"1845-05-10","locations":[{"id":2189,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":110,"title":"Frederick Douglass Publishes Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-05-28","end_date":"1845-05-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) grew up as a slave on a plantation in Maryland; he was the son of a white man.  After 20 years of living in the horrible, violent conditions of the institution of slavery, Douglass escaped to the North.  He became educated and one of the most prominent and outspoken abolitionists.  This book is a narration of his life, with a preface written by another strong abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, and it was published by the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston.  Southern reaction to the book was strong; many believed that his stories of extreme violence within their institution of slavery were simply fabricated.  &lt;br /&gt;With this publication, Douglass appealed to a wider audience of reformers than just those who opposed slavery: his stories roused the sentiments of groups for women's rights, temperance, and publication education as well.  A review of the book published in William Lloyd Garrison's abolitionist newspaper The Liberator gave a prediction of its impact in generating and inflaming anti-slavery sentiment throughout the United States: It will leave a mark upon this age which the busy finger of time will deepen at every touch. It will generate a public sentiment in this nation, in the presence of which our pro-slavery laws and constitutions shall be like chaff in the presence of fire. It contains the spark which will kindle up the smouldering embers of freedom in a million souls, and light up our whole continent with the flames of liberty.'  Between its publication in 1845 and the year 1850, the book sold more than 30,000 copies, and Douglass became a well known symbol of ardent abolitionist beliefs and the rejuvenated free man."],"display_date":"May 28, 1845","search_date":"1845-05-28","locations":[{"id":5930,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":238,"title":"Mary Church Terrell is First Black Woman to Serve on Washington, D.C.

It was co-founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church Bishop Isaac Wiley and the Freedmen's Aid Society as a black teachers' college.  Administered by white men for the first two decades of its existence, black Methodist leaders took over the leadership of the school in 1893.  Wiley became an important institution in the twentieth century, enrolling major players in the Civil Rights movement in Texas.  Its students staged Texas's first sit-ins in the 1960s and James Farmer, a 1938 alumnus, was the founder of the Congress On Racial Equality (CORE).&lt;br /&gt;In a larger context, Wiley's founding was just one example of the wave of educational institutions whites established and/or managed specifically for black students in the wake of emancipation to channel the energies of young freed slaves and socialize them in the ways of the white-dominated South.  In many Eastern states, negro' colleges were established with taxpayer-funded state support as part of the emphasis Southern legislators placed on establishing a public educational system which followed the separate-but-equal' philosophy that Plessy v. Ferguson would legalize a few decades later.  The case of Texas, however, was a bit different than that of North Carolina or Tennessee.  The Annual Report of the United States Commissioner of Public Education published in August 1873 identified Texas as the last of the Southern states to act' legislatively to provide for the education of colored children' and young adults.

As a result, Tennessee was able to get through Reconstruction with relatively few changes to its state constitution.  In 1873, a majority-white legislature passed a new public school law mandating separate but equal for black students and teachers, supported by property taxes and, ironically enough, poll taxes.  Despite its siding with the Union in the Civil War, the school segregation laws of West Virginia and Kentucky proved that racism was not limited to the Five Military Districts and Tennessee.  West Virginia's updated segregation law provided that separate black schools should only be opened if the number of black students in the district exceeded 15.  Kentucky followed its southern neighbor's example by making it illegal for a white child to attend a black school, and vice versa, in 1873, just five years after it had barred school segregation.  The following year legislators instituted uniform, federally-funded segregation in the education system.  &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, even some unredeemed' states managed to institute separate schools for the races, as evidenced by an August Atlanta Constitution editorial by Joseph Brown criticizing the Atlanta Board of Education and City Council for refusing to allow a local white woman, who had been teaching in the colored system, to transfer into the white schools.  The latter part of Brown's article offers a notable disclaimer to reiterate directly what I have frequently said; that I am not, and never have been, an advocate of social equality between the races; I have always insisted that the races should have separate schools.'  Undoubtedly, millions of white Southerners shared Brown's opinion, believing black students to be inherently inferior in the academic arena, a dangerous and unpredictable social element unfit to mix with white children, or sexual deviants waiting to ravish young white girls on the way home from school (or all three).  &lt;br /&gt;By 1873, the importance of segregation in public education was already commonly accepted in a majority of white Southern states as necessary for peaceful racial coexistence, even in states (like Georgia) which did not yet have a legislated framework for two parallel educational systems.  The legal entrenchment of separate but equal' schools, first seen in two states outside the Deep South and outside the reach of Federally-protected black equality, laid the groundwork for the later institutionalization of Jim Crow segregation in almost every area of social and educational life throughout the South."],"display_date":"August 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-31","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":315,"title":"Southern Historical Society moves to Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-08-14","end_date":"1873-08-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["From its 1869 establishment in New Orleans, the Southern Historical Society sought to establish a branch in every southern state, but membership was low in the first four years of the its existence.

Most of the delegates to the convention had been prominent Confederate supporters (Virginia ex-Governor John Letcher) or former Confederate military officers; South Carolina's delegation was certainly dripping with Southern brass, naming Generals Butler, Kershaw, Conner, Hagood, Bonham, and McGowah, and Colonel McIver' as representatives.  &lt;br /&gt;The convention delegates adopted a number of resolutions which would shape the SHS's future influence.

The move to the former Confederate capitol was accompanied by a revamped mission statement directing the SHS to preserve the records and incidents of the war' while unofficially interpreting the evidence from a sympathetic Southern viewpoint.

(Edgar 388)  As a result of black Republicans' overwhelming legislative successes (blacks won 255 of the 487 federal and state elections in South Carolina between 1867 and 1876), equal opportunity education was made a top priority.  A government-funded public school system was instituted, albeit with segregated secondary and elementary schools, and the former South Carolina College was re-chartered in 1865 as the University of South Carolina.  Two black trustees were appointed in 1869, and integration of the University began in earnest in the fall of 1873.   In a series of firsts that year, the school hired Richard D. Greener, its first black professor, to teach metaphysics, and subsequently enrolled of then-Secretary of State Henry E. Hayne as the school's first black student.  The school was the only Southern state university open to black students&lt;br /&gt;Integration, however, quickly became a sort of unintended reverse segregation as the last native white professors and students withdrew in protest, leaving only Radical white professors, black professors, and black students at USC.  The lack of a conservative presence earned the school the derisive epithet of Reconstruction University' and School for the Deaf and Blind' among white Carolinians, and white boycotts of the school extended to neighboring states as well. The Atlanta Constitution's educational announcements mentioned nearly every institute of higher education in the South, from Davidson College and the University of Virginia to ladies' finishing schools; nowhere do those ads mention USC and the opportunities it would provide for biracial education.  Meanwhile, editorials in influential papers like the Richmond Dispatch decried any educational funding or policy bill under which negroes shall be admitted upon the same terms as whites' and declaring that, should a Southern state school choose to receive and use federal funding to provide integrated schools, that institution would quickly lose its white patronage.  &lt;br /&gt;USC's brief four-year interlude of integration ended in 1876 with the conservatives' Redemption of South Carolina.  Democrats quickly closed the school in 1877 and reopened it in 1881, again as an all-white institution.  White opposition to integration, especially in higher education, was a powerful force in the postwar South as whites struggled to reestablish their social identity and cultural supremacy in the face of competition from resourceful and capable former slaves.  The University of South Carolina was an anomalous but important experiment which demonstrated that, contrary to contemporary popular opinion, black students could indeed benefit from higher education just as much as white students."],"display_date":"August 1873 - December 1877","search_date":"1875-10-16","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":333,"title":"Dedication of the first colored high school in Kentucky\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-07","end_date":"1873-10-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Louisville Central Colored School was the first black' school built under the direction of the Louisville Board of Trustees of the Public Schools. The new three-story structure, which cost 23,000 and was funded by taxpayers and the new Kentucky public educational system, also responded to a genuine desire of the black community to provide what the local paper called a sound common school education' for its young students.  White citizens of Louisville, not wanting the state to be behindhand as regards the education of the colored people,' agreed that a new, elegant' facility for black students was necessary, as long as their own children remained housed in whites-only buildings.  The fawning Courier-Journal reported that the new school's trustees were all black, which was unusual, especially for a school with such a large number of students (approximately 300 were enrolled, with maximum capacity at 600 pupils).  Often, whites preferred to have people of their own race supervising black educators in order to ensure that appropriate messages and teaching methods were being used to socialize young blacks to know their place' in the community.&lt;br /&gt;Republican control of Kentucky did little to stop the spread of segregation in the state.  Howard Rabinowitz's essay on the post-war shift from exclusion to segregation, rather than integration, sheds some light on the reasons the Republican party of the 1870s chose not to support integration, yet moved forward from total exclusion.  Segregation became a middle ground which allowed politicians to appease white voters and avoid integration while complying with the letter, though not the spirit, of Federal laws barring exclusion and forcing states to provide equal opportunities for their black citizens.  Some black Southerners unwittingly supported segregated schools as a means of taking care of their own, not realizing the precedent such an institution would set.  Indeed, segregation became the symbol of white supremacy in the American South after the Civil War, replacing the plantation big house' and slave owning Master' of the antebellum period, spreading rapidly from education to transportation to consumption spaces like restaurants, shops, and hotels.  The sheer size and speed of segregation left freedmen essentially powerless to stop legalized Jim Crow laws of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."],"display_date":"October 7, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-07","locations":[{"id":4800,"lat":38.0422598094,"lng":-84.4586978215,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":358,"title":"Maggie L.

This announcement offers a glimpse into what the education of genteel women in the South during the Reconstruction would aim to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The notion of women as teachers and serious students had only emerged a few years before.  With the onset of the Civil War, the roles of women as both mothers and wives changed drastically.  One of the more significant roles which women began to take on in the South was that of the teacher in a more professional standing.  Traditionally, men had taught in the more academic settings, while women would have been relegated to more home-oriented topics.  With the men at war, the women took over the role of teaching.  Unsurprisingly, the women sought to keep these positions, and the incomes they could bring with them, when the war ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women's schools like the Edgemont Select School were emerging throughout the South during the post-war period.

Despite this apparent progress, however, women later lamented in their diaries and journals that these schools could not prepare them for the real world.

Many blacks considered Washington an inspirational leader as he encouraged the oppressed blacks to pursue an industrial education as a mode of escape from the system of deprivation and virtual slavery that was set up in the South.  Conversely, Washington convinced much of white America that the industrial education would keep the blacks in a low position.  This notion consoled whites, and, after delivering a speech that later became known as the Atlanta Compromise,' Washington was deemed a talented representative of the Negroes.'  &lt;br /&gt;In spite of Washington's popularity at the end of the nineteenth century, however, he faced much criticism by his more progressive successors, most notably the famous W.

He further demonstrated his support by referencing his time in the Legislature, Senate, and House of Delegates, drawing particular attention to his vote against a coupon procedure that took away school money.  In addition to showing his personal support for education, Daniel asserted the support of the Democratic Party for the system of public education.  The speeches explained the actions of the Democrats in order to clarify their support for education, and they attempted to negatively portray the Republican Party as well. &lt;br /&gt;Public education was an important topic in political debate towards the end of the nineteenth century, especially in Virginia as the state government had to deal with Virginia's enormous debt.

By 1881, Virginia residents desired a strong public education system.  Because all children were in need of education, discussion of public education served as a guise for incorporating the race and class issues into politics.

Benjamin, however, was able to regain much of his prosperity in the ensuing years.  Determined to , in his own words , overthrow an aristocracy which had come down to us from colonial days', he mounted a campaign in the 1880s to foment discontent amongst the agricultural community within South Carolina with the ruling agricultural political establishment.  Championing diversification and agricultural education, he was one of the founders of the Edgefield Agricultural Society in 1885.  &lt;br /&gt;However, it was the decision by Francis W. Dawson, the Editor of the News and Courier, to publish several of Tillman's letters in his newspaper in November of 1885 which dramatically increased his notoriety and popularity around the state.  In these letters he made a forceful case for increased agricultural education in South Carolina.  Praising the agricultural-specific colleges of Michigan, Kansas, and Mississippi, Tillman decried the pitiful, contemptible, so-called agricultural annex' at the South Carolina College in Columbia.  Claiming a desperate need for additional scientific training in agriculture within the state, he pointed to the distinct agricultural character of the state's populace , three-fourths of which are farmers -- as evidence that less of the farmer's money' should be used to fund the study of the professional arts.  Tillman proposed that the state legislature use the interest it had earned off the 30,000 acres appropriated to it by Congress in 1862 , roughly 11,520 , to finance such an agricultural institution as is found in the aforementioned states.&lt;br /&gt;In a later letter, Tillman delivered a stirring indictment of the institutions set up to support agricultural interests within the state of South Carolina , namely, the Board of Agriculture, the State Agricultural Society, and the College of South Carolina.  He intricately described a Board dominated by non-farmers uninterested in furthering agricultural progress, an Agricultural Society whose noble intentions are marred by bureaucratization and partisanship, and a College barely devoted to inculcating agricultural knowledge amongst its student body .  He proposed that South Carolina hold annual farmer's conventions as they do in many Northern states, and advocated the formation of agricultural societies, fairs, and farmer's institutes.  Tillman ended his letter with a call to the farmers of South Carolina to organize and push such reforms, and pleaded that the prosperity of the state is intimately tied to their implementation, especially that of agricultural education.&lt;br /&gt;Often depicted as a populist,' Tillman went on to serve both as governor and United States senator for the state of South Carolina, where he became , once again, in his own words , the most powerful political factor in South Carolina.'"],"display_date":"November 19, 1885","search_date":"1885-11-19","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":525,"title":"Calvin H.

Wiley revolutionized the educational system. The Common School System, as North Carolina's first statewide publicly supported education system, sought to educate all white boys living within the state. In his first address to the residents of North Carolina, he appealed to them and tried to convince them that, the ideas that these schools are intended only for poor children should everywhere be discouraged; and it should be understood and proclaimed that this is a great bounty, a fountain opened for all the children of the State, without distinction of classes, promising equal benefits to all, and worthy of the fostering care of all. Wiley took his responsibility to reorganize and reform the school system of his state extremely seriously, stating, with my conception of the difficulties which surround me, of the greatness of the cause, and of the importance of the duties I owe to the public, I feel oppressed and nearly overwhelmed with concern. His earnestness translated into action as he used his term to stimulate interest in education, improve quality of teachers, acquire better equipment and textbook for students, and establish public school libraries. ","With Wiley's help, North Carolina increased the number of schools, school districts, and the literacy rate of its voters. The State Superintendent said of the Common School System, North Carolina has the start of all her Southern sisters in educational matters. Indeed, the state's example inspired a resolution at the Memphis Convention of southern states in June that recommended the expansion and improvement of public education because it has a practical bearing upon the permanent prosperity of the Southern States. The Federal Union of Georgia echoed Wiley's view of the uses common schools, stating, we are opposed to what are termed Poor Schools. The people want a Republican system of education - a system, by which the rich and the poor, will enjoy equal advantages, and where all can partake of the common bounty of the State. During this period, the South is lagging behind the North in the development of public education systems. Thus, North Carolina's efforts and similar ones in other southern states show a belief in the education of its common citizens and a conscious desire to catch up with the North in establishing and improving public school systems."],"display_date":"January 1, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-01","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":532,"title":"Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute Opened\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-10-01","end_date":"1883-10-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Education has always been the most stressed issue advocated by Civil Rights activists.

In May, 1861, three slaves had run away from their master and sought refuge within Union lines at Fort Monroe.  When their master, Colonel Charles Mallory attempted to claim them, General Butler refused. Butler drew on his legal training for his answer.  He called the slaves contraband,' and because they could be used by the Confederates in the war against the Union, he would not return the slaves.  This, of course, contradicted the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850.  But the Confederacy was no longer a part of the United States; therefore, rebelling states were no longer entitled to protection under United States law, Butler reasoned.  His decision infuriated southerners.  Word spread among slaves in the Hampton area, and hundreds of slaves began to flood the Union lines.  Butler employed them in digging ditches, in his words, saving our soldiers from that labor, under the gleam of the mid-day sun.'  Many of the slave women laundered uniforms for the Union soldiers.  The slaves were paid for their labor.  &lt;br /&gt;By July, there were so many former slaves living in the city of Hampton, Butler did not know what to do with them.  He wrote a letter to Secretary Cameron on July 20, published in the New York Times several weeks later.  In it, he asked, What shall be done with them?'  He continued, Are these men, women, and children, slaves?  Are they free?'  He received a reply in August, described in The New York Herald.  The response stated that Congress had passed a new act on August 6.  Fugitive slaves in rebelling states did not have to be returned to their masters, and certainly any slave used in the Confederate war effort was forfeited.  The letter was far from abolition, mentioning reimbursing slaveholders for their escaped slaves after the war.  Still, it was a step toward emancipation, and the importance of the decision was clear to both Northerners and Southerners.  News articles about the so-called contrabands' were common.  An article in December described ex-slaves living in former President Tyler's residence in Hampton.  The basement is occupied as a contraband school-room;there stood about fifty little black children as eagerly pursueing [sic] their studies as any children could,' wrote a reporter stationed at Fort Monroe.  Many of the former slaves questioned what would become of them at the end of the war.

Yellow fever and malaria greatly afflicted coastal Texas, especially Galveston, in the 1840s and 1850s. The mortality rates were so bad that nearly fifty percent of children were dying before they reached adulthood on the coastline of Texas. Doctors were deficient in engineering sanitation standards, enforcing quarantines, and educating citizens about the importance of good hygiene. Supplies were also lacking, as doctors asked surgical patients to imbibe whiskey because there was no anesthetic to apply to them. <br />Another pestilence in the land arose from a worrisome number of medical quacks. They would tell patients that they were physicians when all they really had training in was sales. They “prescribed' (sold) “magical' pills that were supposed to have the qualities of a modern-day Viagra, and they urged people to drink and eat exorbitant amounts of tonics and pills. The formally-educated physicians warned the public about the dangers of medical quacks by publishing articles in Houston newspapers. Finally, in 1853, they formed the Texas Medical Association in order to set a quality standard for medical practice. The United States Senate later took notice of the Texas Medical Association when its president, a Mr. Spencer asked for the Senate to pass a law that would protect Texas physicians in the United States Navy. He claimed that doctors in the Navy had been given random and unnecessary orders by their superior officers. The Texas Medical Association simply wanted to protect its physicians who were in the Navy and give them the same rank and rights as those who might attempt to give them orders.

Her purpose in writing the book was to explain why she thought that whites were still unwilling to take pity on slaves.  While Stowe claimed that she understood that slaves were more than property, she postulated that other whites still saw slaves as sub-human.  Stowe did admit that she did not fully understand blacks, but she thought that by applying Christian kindness to them, their situation might be helped.  One shocking thing that Stowe revealed was that she believed that slaves repulsed themselves; she wrote that they thought they were evil because their skin was black.  She did not think that blacks were capable of reaching the same intellectual and moral heights as whites, and she blames that inability on their disgust in themselves.  Southerners were not at all pleased with Stowe's book.  Critics characterized it as having a narrow field of view.  She was accused of making generalizations about Southerners as being unaffected by the plights of slaves.  This bothered critics who felt that Southerners were not deficient in their morality.  One critic tried to explain that the North had the same prejudices as the South.  He wrote wherever man is found, we find equally the same vices, crimes, and weaknesses.   Southerners were also alarmed at the lack of biblical references in <em>A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  They felt that she was writing too righteously not to be using the Bible.

The brochure reports that the school's emphasis on creating gentleman' stems from its use of many of the same methods of teaching and curriculum that is used at the University of Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;The course of study at the prep school shows many of the classic liberal arts courses which Thomas Jefferson would have approved of , including such mainstays as English, the Latin and Greek languages, modern languages, pure mathematics, natural sciences, penmanship and book-keeping.

A number of huge donations to Southern educational efforts, most notably the London Banker George Peabody's 2 million dollar gift, occurred throughout the end of the 19th century.  However these efforts certainly did not make the Norwood experience the norm for Southern adolescents, as blacks and the poor still were largely illiterate and struggled to find proper schooling.

The sense of unity in the town, as well as the Dispatch's monopoly over news, is quite evident from the sing-songy lyrics as the poem reads To it all readers turn, and they can look; pleased on a paper who abhor a book; those who ne'er deign'd their bible to peruse; would think it hard to be denied their news.'  Continuing the jolly nature of the poem, a later verse pays tribute to the intellectual prowess of the town's inhabitants by announcing that the poem, and the daily news, provides a treat; where each promiscuous guest sits down to eat; and such this mental food, as we may call; something to all men, and to some men all.'  &lt;br /&gt;Therefore, the newspaper used the poem as an effort to demonstrate that Whytheville was a town of well-educated citizens whom had a true sense of community.  This depiction of society, though entrenched in ideals, is not very realistic and is not depictive of what most Southern towns were like in this day.  The Carrier's Address's hope that all citizens would be able to enjoy the mental treat' of the poem was probably rather far-fetched as illiteracy rates remained quite high until the educational renaissance reached its peak closer to the turn of the century.  Thus, the carrier's depiction of his town was not valid, but rather, when viewed through the lens of the upper, generally white, elite depicted the society the newspaper's owners wanted to see, and could take pride in."],"display_date":"December 25, 1877","search_date":"1877-12-25","locations":[{"id":14367,"lat":36.9171327375,"lng":-81.0785741345,"zoom":10,"place":"WYTHE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":856,"title":"Cholera Epidemic in New Orleans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-11-29","end_date":"1853-12-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["New Orleans was hit very hard by infectious disease in 1853.  Not only did the city have to contend with an outbreak of yellow fever, but cholera broke out as well.  Most likely, the appalling sanitation system in New Orleans contributed to it.  While cholera only took the lives of 129 people in late 1853 (as opposed to the near 8,000 who died from yellow fever) it still caused serious alarm.  Most of the mortalities occurred among the immigrant community who likely had no access to proper drinking water.  Cholera also struck New Orleans poor, free blacks, who lived in filthy and cramped rooms. &lt;br /&gt;Not much was known about either yellow fever or cholera in 1853.  In fact, physicians believed that cholera was transported through the air simply because victims of cholera claimed that they had trouble breathing.  This false belief was carried out to the extreme.  No one was willing to nurse the victims of cholera back to health for fear of catching the airborne' disease.  Therefore, many victims died alone in their homes.  Fearful citizens would burn tar in the streets to create a thick smoke which they believed might help eradicate the infection from the air.  Stray animals were also believed to be vectors of infection, and people would let the dead bodies of the animals decompose in the street instead of removing the bodies for fear of contracting cholera.  &lt;br /&gt; One interesting remedy' for cholera was alcohol consumption.  This was particularly interesting in a time when the subject of temperance was so hotly debated.  Women and even children would imbibe spirits because it was believed that it would cure cholera.  The tragedy was that cholera was spread through drinking- not drinking alcohol, but drinking water.  Cholera traveled in rivers and into public drinking water.  The city of New Orleans was so afflicted by foulness and a misunderstanding of disease, that it made a perfect cesspool for disease."],"display_date":"November 29, 1853 - December 2, 1853","search_date":"1853-11-30","locations":[{"id":5598,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":869,"title":"Improvements at the Virginia Military Institute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-08-11","end_date":"1853-08-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Virginia Military Institute (VMI) was created in 1836 when funding was set aside for it in lieu of an arsenal in Lexington.  Lexington lies roughly fifty miles to the northeast of Roanoke.  It was instantly a source of pride for Virginia.  Shortly after VMI was created, South Carolina tried to recreate VMI in their version which they called the Citadel.  The cadets at both schools had rivalries concerning who had more state patriotism' (Volo, p. 188).  At VMI and the Citadel, cadets learned the arts of tactics, operations, drill, and horse riding in addition to the traditional subjects.  Occasionally, the cadets at VMI would march off campus and into the town of Lexington to show off their skill at drill.  The whole state of Virginia was immensely proud of VMI. &lt;br /&gt;               One of the proudest parents of a VMI cadet was Philip St. George Cocke from Belmead, Virginia.

Cocke saw many additions to the grounds of the school including additional barracks, society rooms for the cadets, and even a new mess hall.  With all of the funding and pride that Virginians poured into VMI, it paid off during the Civil War when the Confederacy raided the stashes of officers from VMI alumni.

Many problems plagued the public school system at the time, including necessary funding and the inclusion of African-Americans into the system. &lt;br /&gt;The state did not have enough money to fund the school system in 1871. In order to get funding, the state issued three modes of taxation for public schools that required schools to be partially funded by a county tax. County school districts were not eligible to receive state money if the county did not provide some of the funding. In Henrico County, not one African-American cast a vote, for or against, the local school tax when it was put to a vote because most of the African-Americans in Henrico were not property owners. The white voters determined the local tax would be initiated in Henrico County and as a result the white voters essentially allocated all of the tax revenue to the white schools. &lt;br /&gt;The state also had to determine how it would allocate its teachers. The Richmond Board of Education session of 1871-1872 needed to decide on how to allocate its teachers. It needed twelve teachers for white schools and fifteen teachers for Negro schools. The teachers with the highest scores on the teacher examination were sent to the white schools and the teachers with the lowest scores were sent to the Negro schools. During this time period it seemed improbable that a competent teacher would end up teaching at a Negro school. This Richmond Board of Education session occurred in the midst of a national debate of whether black teachers were more equipped to teach black students.

They framed their message around rhetoric of class conflict that contrasted the interests of average Virginians against the interests of wealthy bondholders.  This message was reflected in a pamphlet of the 1878 Readjuster Platform that stated that, The bondholder shall pay taxes as well as the farmer and the laboring man,' and that, The money assessed to free schools shall not be stolen from the treasury and given to the bondholder, but shall be sacredly applied to our schools white and colored.'

Notable measures passed under the constitution include Article 150 which transferred the state capital from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, Article 224 which mandated the creation of a free public school system, and Article 188 which stated that no restraints could be made on suffrage based on, race, color, or previous condition.' Although these measures appeared to signal a return to the legacy of reconstruction, in reality their progressive spirit was killed by the reactionary articles passed elsewhere under the constitution and the de facto  racist, patriarchal, and plutocratic realities of 1879 Louisiana. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most significant of these laws is the 1 poll tax passed under article 208.  Although the purpose of this measure was ostensibly to fund state education, its true purpose is clearly to disenfranchise poor voters, and particularly poor black voters, who could pose a threat to Bourbon control at the ballot box.  Another measure designed to maintain Bourbon control over the state apparatus was the continuation of the charter for the state lottery under Article 167.  Although this article seems innocuous, because Bourbon politicians pilfered most of the lottery returns to grease their political machine in reality it was a crucial element toward maintaining Bourbon control over the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the content of the constitution entrenched the existing hierarchies of the state, some of the most pernicious discriminatory aspects of Louisiana law after the ratification of the constitution of 1879 were legal precedents which the new constitution carried over with its ratification.  For example, the Louisiana Magistrate and Parish Officer's Guide, published in 1883 reflected the full spectrum of Louisiana's patriarchal laws.  For example the guide instructs officials that a woman cannot sue without her husband's permission, or bear witness to a will.  Perhaps the most subtly patriarchal of all the instructions provided to officials, is that a woman cannot re-marry until she has been separated from her husband for at least 10 months (almost certainly so as to ensure the new husband will not have his sexual dominion over his wife challenged by a pregnancy from her previous husband).  Another discriminatory aspect of the 1879 constitution comes through the extremely homophobic instructions that criminals who are convicted of attempted rape are to receive no more than two years in prison, while any person convicted of sodomy is sentenced to a life term of hard labor."],"display_date":"December 8, 1879","search_date":"1879-12-08","locations":[{"id":5600,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1384,"title":"Anne Sullivan begins teaching Helen Keller\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-03-03","end_date":"1887-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Helen Keller was born in Tuscumbia, Alabama in 1880.

The school was founded in 1831, finally opening its doors on April 18 and enrolling 52 students by May of that year.&lt;br /&gt;However, before the University could open and function as an institution of higher learning, years of planning were required.  It was being established almost simultaneously with the new government and constitution of the state of Alabama.  When the legislature formally launched the Seminary of Learning at Cahawba in 1820, they named it The University of the State of Alabama.'  Even at this time, before anyone even fathomed a specific site, Alabama's General Assembly addressed the use of the extra lands from the government grant, and they went on the record as saying, the moneys which may be raised from such lands by rent, lease, or sale, or from any other quarter for the purpose aforesaid, shall be, and remain, a fund for the exclusive support of a State University for the promotion of the arts, literature, and sciences (Convention').'&lt;br /&gt;Also, in the same legislative session, the Alabama Assembly emphasized their duty from that day forward, to provide effectual means for the improvement and permanent security of the lands and endowments of such institutions (Convention').'  In other words, the state government would uphold its dedication to the public university under these constitutional provisions and statutory mandates.  It eventually became simply the University of Alabama, and it even transformed temporarily into a military school at the onset of the Civil War.  After the Union troops defeated the South, they destroyed all but seven buildings on campus, and a reconstructed University did not open until 1871."],"display_date":"December 18, 1820","search_date":"1820-12-18","locations":[{"id":24,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"CAHAWBA&#40;BIBB&#41;, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1605,"title":"Georgia School of Technology Commences First Term\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-10-05","end_date":"1888-10-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 5th the Georgia School of Technology opened with around one hundred students.

While the matriculation, tuition, and rent fees remained at pre-Civil War levels, one should not be surprised to find that board has regularly advanced in price with the cost of supplies.'  Attempting to stifle this upward trend in cost, Mr. Maupin discusses other possible accommodations, such as paying 15 per month if paid in specie or in supplies necessary for a boarding house.'  Mr. Maupin also discusses an act of the Virginia legislature , one that Confederate Secretary of War and University graduate James A. Seddon had strongly advocated , that allowed disabled Virginia soldiers free tuition, matriculation, and rent if they proved themselves unable to pay their charges.  Similarly-situated Confederate veterans from other states could have their tuition fees waived upon approval by the University.&lt;br /&gt;Two of those students who benefited from the University's generosity were George L. Christian and his roommate, W.C. Holmes.  Christian, who had lost a foot, and Holmes, whose right arm was rendered useless, formed a sort of friendship of utility, as Christian assisted Holmes in his note-taking and Holmes helped Christian to walk around grounds.  At night, in the absence of furniture, the two men made beds of their old Confederate army blankets.

Any student that returned for his second or third year only did so because he had been rendered incapable of service to the Confederate cause.'

It cost 20 dollars to buy a copy of the <em>Map of Virginia</em>. <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> asserted this to be a moderate price for a map of such fine quality. The sale of the <em>Map of</em> <em>Virginia </em>coincided with improvements in transportation; roads and use of waterways. This made it extremely popular among Virginians to own a map of high quality in order to have a coherent understanding of the land around them."," To produce the <em>Map of Virginia</em> cartographers and printers in Richmond used the process of planographic printing. This process made map printing faster and far less expensive. According historian David Woodward, to produce the <em>Map of Virginia </em>printers used lithographic ink or chalk to draw on stone. Printers accentuated the contrast between the inked and un-inked regions of the stone by washing the stone with a weak solution of nitric acid. This increased the porosity and water absorbing capacity of the un-inked regions. The stone accepted ink within the drawn images and characters, and rejected ink within the moistened areas when a roller covered with greasy ink passed over the stone. In the final step of reproducing of the <em>Map of Virginia</em>, printers placed a sheet of paper in a frame that they brought in contact with the inked surface. Printers transferred the image from stone to paper by applying pressure between the paper and inked surface. "," The <em>Map of Virginia</em> resulted from many years of labor, as well as at a great cost of care and money, on the part of cartographers and printers. <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> wrote that no map of Virginia before this had surpassed in variety and accuracy of detail, or in beauty and elegance of execution. With an inadequate supply of maps in the early nineteenth century, Americans had a poor concept of their surroundings apart from the locations of plantations and stores in their local area. Maps in circulation tended to be unreliable and too expensive for most citizens to own. Beginning in 1820, it became increasingly important for Virginians to own maps as transportation improved with development of roads and use of waterways. Improvements in transportation coincided with the development of the new printing process, planographic printing. The development of planographic printing made maps far more accessible, accurate and affordable.

The same publication named eight distinguished faculty members who they believed would contribute the most to the strength of the new school. Among these eight faculty names was Doctor C.K. Winston. The curriculum at the University of Nashville medical school was rigorous. Historian F.

According to Davenport, the medical school faculty recommended the regularity of eating and exercises in addition to good hygiene, such as bathing on daily basis. In addition to hygiene, professionals at the time regarded the presumed inferiority of African Americans as a medical debate. Two students at the University of Nashville even presented dissertations attempting to prove the theory believed by many that the Negro belonged to a distinct and inferior race. Davenport described the experiments they used to examine the differences in facial angles between the two races. They spoke of the differences between certain nose structures of the white and black man. They looked under a microscope at a white man's piece of a hair and a black man's piece of hair, concluding that the black man's hair was decisively coarser and frizzier than the white man's. Dissertations such as these given at a well respected institution like the University of Nashville further asserted feelings of superiority by southerners over their black counterparts.

Hester discovered that her husband, Harry Tomlin, Jr. had written a letter to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia in December of the previous year in which he asked to rent a tract of land on Cocke's plantation.  Hester felt impelled to interfere.  A month after Harry wrote the aforementioned letter, Hester wrote an additional note to Dr. Cocke in which she begged him to deny her husband the land.  Hester explained, I hate to see [Harry] undertake anything that will not bring in money. . .for we are very destitute.  Women of the Central Virginia in the 1870's and 1880's felt trepidation when they envisioned a life of poverty; therefore, women played an active role in maintaining or improving their family's welfare.","Hester Tomlin was not the only woman in Central Virginia who feared poverty.  On the contrary, poverty was a salient topic to women across the region, as they contemplated their marriages, both present and future.  On January 30, 1885, Fredericksburg's local paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed a story about a woman who chose to marry a wealthy man and secure her economic future instead of marrying the poor man whom she loved.  This story appeared on the front page of the Fredericksburg paper.  In the aftermath of the economic depression of the 1870's, the topic was salient to the women in Central Virginia.  ","Many women in Central Virginia struggled or failed in their attempts to prevent or end their family's battle with poverty.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she admitted, I am living now on the charity of others and must continue to do so unless I can help myself in some boarding deportment. . .  Hester and other women of the time considered allowing people to live in their home as boarders so that they could earn money.  Yet, as Edward Ayers explains in <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Women [in the South] found exceedingly few opportunities to earn money in the countryside.  However, those who lived in rural areas, such as the farming areas in Central Virginia, could aid in farm labor.  An advertisement in the Fredericksburg newspaper in 1886 requested a farmer with a wife who understands the dairy business to help with the labor. ","Women, like Hester, throughout Virginia and in other southern states improved the economic wellbeing of their families by using a variety of methods for making money during the late nineteenth century, according to Ayers.  Ayers explains that farm women of the late nineteenth century normally produced and mended all of their family members' clothing.  Some women sold items such as butter, eggs, milk, and honey in order help their families earn more money.  Others made a profit by serving as a midwife to neighboring women.  Ayers also describes the vital role that women played as teachers in their communities during this time period.  In fact, Ayers points out that the number of female teachers in the South doubled in the 1880's. ","In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Central Virginians recognized the active role of women like Hester who worked diligently to better their family's financial situation.  On January 28, 1887, the <em>Free Lance</em> of Fredericksburg printed an article entitled They Never Strike that commended women for their hard work.  Yet, secretive or more subtle actions these women undertook in order to secure their family's future were undoubtedly overlooked.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she opened by admitting that writing the letter carried the great risk that her husband would find out about her interference.  In closing the letter, Hester requested that Dr. Cocke burn the note and never tell anyone about its contents.  Hester was both frantic and fearful. At times, women in Central Virginia acted against the wishes of the men in their lives in an effort to save their families or themselves from the poverty that threatened the families of Central Virginia during this time."],"display_date":"January 1, 1876 - January 30, 1885","search_date":"1880-07-16","locations":[{"id":13822,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2014,"title":"Southern History Retold in the Late Nineteenth Century\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-05-04","end_date":"1888-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As Edmund Halsey reflected over the time he served in the Civil War, he grew disheartened and worried.  In 1884 Halsey was concerned that, as time passed, a disconnect would develop between Central Virginians and their ability to appreciate the reasons why the war veterans from their area risked their lives to defend the South in the Civil War.  In a letter written from Edmund Halsey to his brother Joseph Halsey of Orange County, Virginia on May 4, 1884, he recapitulated the two brothers' experiences in the Battle of the Wilderness, which took place in Spotsylvania County, Virginia.  Edmund Halsey reflected, It seems strange to think that so many years have passed since then, but when we think of the many who were living there - in the field and at home - and now few are left and those few so scattered and changed it seems like recalling scenes in the Revolution.  Central Virginians who discussed historical events during the latter portion of the nineteenth century had several motives for their attention to the past.  According to Edward Ayers in Southern Crossing, one of these motives included a desire to prevent older Virginians from forgetting and younger Virginians from never learning about the history of their predecessors.  ","A desire to offset negative perceptions of the area also motivated Central Virginia's to focus on the past.  Like Halsey, Central Virginians were interested in reconstructing the history of their particular families and communities so that future generations would appreciate the events and respect the people of the past.  On April 19, 1887, Reverend Horace E. Hayden wrote to Alfred L. Holladay of Prospect Hill, Virginia requesting information about the genealogy and military involvement of the Holladay family.  Hayden was preparing a volume entitled Virginia Genealogies.  Hayden commented on Holladay's contribution to his book as he proclaimed that Holladay's sketch of the Virginia matron, a quiet farmer's wife, would offset the slander of those who argued that Virginians were self confident but ignorant planters, necessarily only once removed from semi-civilization.  Hayden attempted to counter what he considered to be northerners' erroneous portrayals of white southerners by retelling the history of several prominent families from Central Virginia.  In 1888, the Fredericksburg paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed an article that countered the negative connotations of the area, such as being behind the times, by emphasizing the positive aspects of the city, such as its hospitable inhabitants and historical importance in the Civil War.","During the latter portion of the nineteenth century, interest in the dissemination of the history of the South was not limited to individuals, such as Halsey, or Virginia, but was, instead, a focus of people throughout the South.  Ayers discusses the fear of Civil War veterans in both Virginia and throughout the South that their descendants would either fail to understand or remember their elders' participation in the Civil War.  In <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>, Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra discuss southerners' effort to recast the history of the South in a positive light.  For instance, educators in the South portrayed slavery as an institution that benefited all those who were involved.  Particularly in the years following the Civil War, people from the South argued that enslaved blacks had led better lives than their free counterparts in the North.  Supporters of the South and its cause defended their honor through the recasting of history in the years following the Civil War."],"display_date":"May 4, 1884 - April 19, 1888","search_date":"1886-04-27","locations":[{"id":14131,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2039,"title":"Bold Burglary Blamed on Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-07-14","end_date":"1868-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of July 9, 1868, the bustling town of Milledgeville, capitol of Georgia, witnessed a daring burglary. Casting subtlety aside, thieves approached Stetson & Brother's Store, drilled a hole through a window shutter, lifted the door's latch, and walked in through the front doors. Dragging the safe (so-called) from the backroom into the common area, the burglars forced it open, stole 500, and left without any real identification.","Police, combing the scene, had few real leads. They arrested several suspects over the ensuing week, but were unable to get any useful information from interrogations and soon let the men go. The community demanded security, so the police soon shifted to blame to a new target. On July 15, the Milledgeville Southern Recorder announced a reward for two negroes, strangers, [who] left on the Augusta train the next morning, suspected of being the leading characters...One of them of small stature, neatly dressed...can read and write and says he is from Boston. The other, is a large raw bone negro shabbily dressed, knock-kneed, and ugly looking face. The convenience of being able to target what sounds like a free, middle class, northern black man and a stereotype of a thieving slave is overwhelming. The Milledgeville police very likely chose two passing blacks as scapegoats, well-aware these suspects would never return to deny the accusation.","     Popular culture in the Reconstruction South cast free or idle black as drunks, thieves, and trouble-makers. This episode shows a desire amongst the authorities of Milledgeville to cast a middle- or upper-class black man in this same stereotypical role. The shorter suspect, educated and wealthy enough to travel from Boston and back, neatly dressed along the way, was a threat to some of the fundamental assumptions Georgian whites held about their black neighbors. If black were able to live civilized lifestyles when given the opportunity, it was no longer the white man's duty to look after an inferior race, but rather an act of oppression. Faced with a need for a scapegoat, Milledgeville's authorities jumped at the chance to simultaneously reinforce the prejudices of the community around them."],"display_date":"July 14, 1868","search_date":"1868-07-14","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2052,"title":"The New Teacher&#39;s Institute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-10-21","end_date":"1886-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Warsaw, Superintendent Robert Hall called a meeting for the new teachers of the Northern Neck Peninsula. The teachers needed to talk about the best way to educate the hundreds of students entering the new public school system. Reverend A. B. Kinsolving opened the session by leading prayers. Mr. Hall began the discussion by encouraging the teachers to express their candid views on each topic covered over the course of the day. The first topic was whether teachers should allow whispering and talking during class. One young woman delivered an emphatic speech about the dangers of tolerating this behavior. Since everyone unanimously agreed on this issue, the group proceeded to the next topic: corporal punishment. There was a lively and animated debate. Since no consensus was reached, the teachers decided to postpone this discussion. They next talked about the best ways to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and other subjects. The body reached an agreement much more quickly on these issues, finishing just in time for lunch.","Few people were familiar with public schools in the 1880s, especially in rural regions like Virginia's Eastern Shore. If they could afford it, parents sent their children to expensive private schools at remote distances. However, nearby Accomack County had opened eight local public schools by 1886, and Richmond County wanted to close the gap. Taxpayers provided 1.126 per child for schools in the Northern Neck, inequitably distributed between white and black schools. Many people wanted to increase this funding for religious reasons. While the teachers disagreed about corporal punishment, everyone at the Institute understood the important role Christian principles would have in the budding school system. Accordingly, the Institute opened its session with a prayer led by the local Reverend. As early as 1875, concerned citizens held concerts of prayer to recognize the importance of studying the Scriptures in all of [the] schools.

There was not a hornet in sight. After planting the gunpowder in a small pile beneath the nest, Teddie focused his sunglass on the match. He retreated to the position of his companions. An explosion rocked the hornets' next, setting it ablaze. In half a second, hornets, which hummed like so many Minnie-balls, and came almost as fast, descended upon the trio. Two flew up Teddie's pantaloons. Bat turned to fly, when a hornet, coming straight as a bullet, struck him in the back of his head and lodged there... Lud could not escape the insects either.

Teddie and Lud were excited to befriend someone who knew his way around the country farm; it did not matter to them that Bat's skin was black. Bat's old master responds with sympathy towards the plight of the three boys, and isn't bothered that two whites have a black boy as their companion. Similar interracial interaction occurred throughout the Upper South; in southern Maryland, blacks and whites worked side by side shelling oysters. In Baptist and Methodist churches across Virginia, blacks and whites often worshipped together.

He saw little or no action in the war for his first eighteen months of service, but he heard reports from members of his regiment who scouted the movement of the Confederate army. He was taken aback when he heard that Confederates had adopted the practice of hanging black men to discourage them and others from joining the Union army. Southerners were determined to punish any black man caught fighting against the South. In a letter to his wife and family in New Hampshire, Shedd proclaimed, Alas For the poor slave It is great wonder to me that they do not rebel; they would if they were not the most quiet, inoffensive race on earth. Besides expressing sympathy for blacks in this letter, he also claimed that slaves in Florida appeared to be more intelligent, to speak better English, and to be better looking than those he saw in South Carolina. To his disappointment, however, there were still no public schools in Florida where people of all races and classes could learn that all men are created equal in the sight of God.","Although many Union soldiers, perhaps even Shedd himself, were still racist during the Civil War, Shedd and other Northerners did see the many benefits of enlisting black soldiers as early as 1862. For many Union soldiers, the violent acts of southerners towards blacks were shocking and repulsive. The large free black population, their perceived prosperity and employment opportunities, and the extensive presence of Union garrisons in Key West all combined to positively influence perception of black Floridians. For Shedd, his intense patriotism, longing for his family, and strong sense of morality is what led him to denounce the maltreatment of blacks. ","Despite Shedd's belief that brave black volunteers did not deserve to be lynched for fighting alongside white Northerners, the lynching of blacks by Southerners, about which Shedd heard reports, did not end with the war, but instead, only gained momentum. In fact, people frequently extolled the lynching of black men as a way to enforce segregation in antebellum Florida. Reconstruction-era violence and lynching was rooted in the determination of white Floridians to keep blacks close to the brutal system of slavery which existed in Calvin Shedd's time.

Jones, the President of the Memphis Conference Female Institute in Jackson, Tennessee, placed in advertisement in a Mississippi weekly newspaper. GREAT REDUCTION IN CHARGES the ad announced, continuing with a brief description of the oldest Female College in the Southwest. Favorably located, easy of access and remarkable for its healthfulness. Thoroughly furnished in all of its departments and supplied with a large corps of competent teachers. "," The fervor with which Mr. Jones sought pupils for his women's academy reflected the competition of the market. His particular ad, for example, was just one of half a dozen such announcements for women's colleges in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky run in that particular day's paper alone. In the years after the war, higher education for middle class white women became more commonplace in southern cities, and as a result, educated and socially conscious women began to assert themselves in communities across the South."," According to historian Marsha Wedell, the beginnings of social movements among middle class white women were well in place in Memphis by the end of the 1870s. Not only were the women organizing, but they were doing so in meaningful ways with significant impact on their surroundings. According to Wedell, these women of Memphis adopted a wide range of urban issues as their personal duties, and succeeded in focusing the attention of the community on the appalling living and working conditions of many of the city's residents. Their work in initiating efforts to address such conditions contributed significantly to the eventual recognition by the city of its responsibility to provide municipal welfare and social services for its citizens. "," As women fought to change their surroundings, they found themselves and their own relationships changed as well by their fight. Groups such as the Nineteenth Century Club, an all women social club formed in Memphis in the spring of 1890 with the purpose of encouraging women to socialize and study together, brought their members out of their homes and into a public sphere where they could interact with one another in a network of support and activism.

The Randolphs of Richmond were one such family. In 1830, William Randolph and his clan maintained several houses and a handful of slaves across the state, living prosperously in the antebellum Virginia. Judging by records left behind, Randolph provided very well for his family, feeding, clothing, and educating them according to the standards of a wealthy southern patriarch.  ","One of Randolph's daughters, Elizabeth, received the same upper-class Southern education given to most wealthy females at the time. While her father was away from home, Elizabeth's schedule was packed with music, drawing, and sewing lessons taught by a private tutor. I have just finished taking my Music lesson, and Mr. Barry thinks I have improved a little, she wrote her father. I have practiced more than usual lately. This routine of music lessons, drawing, and other instruction expected of an antebellum housewife was standard fare for wealthy girls in the process of receiving their training. Rarely did girls get the kind of classical education in philosophy, history, and the sciences that their male counterparts received. Still, at the time Elizabeth wrote in the 1830's, women's education in the South was beginning to undergo a profound change - one that would make her form of schooling obsolete.","     Immediately after the Revolutionary War, female education was valued very highly. Educational reforms at the time favored higher education for women in order to prepare them to become republican mothers and pass on classical schooling to their children. After a time, however, that sentiment began to decline. In the antebellum South, classics and philosophy were increasingly replaced by drawing and embroidery. Higher education for women would not regain its former popularity until the 1850's when a new wave of reform swept over the South. Elizabeth Randolph, forced to study music and sewing instead of Plato, was the product of a Southern culture that failed to see classical education and domestic training as compatible. It was very common, even expected, for wealthy fathers like William Randolph to train their daughters as housewives instead of intellectuals."],"display_date":"August 24, 1830","search_date":"1830-08-24","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2135,"title":"College Life Before the Civil War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-04-13","end_date":"1837-04-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Without question, higher education in the antebellum South was a luxury reserved primarily for the wealthy. Only the rich sent their children to college, and even among the upper-class, a college education was not a prerequisite for success. Many wealthy Southern families considered a college education to be an extravagance or even a threat to a social order where social class and racial superiority defined individual standing. Higher education before the Civil War was only for gentlemen and those destined for skilled professions.","Because college was viewed as such a luxury, those families that did send their sons to American universities tended to expect a certain degree of influence and control. Claiborne Gooch, an upper-class Virginian living outside Richmond, sent two of his sons, Richard and Phillip, to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. during the 1830's. Things did not go smoothly, however, and Richard (the youngest Gooch boy) routinely got into trouble with his professors. One day, as punishment, he was forced to kneel in front of the professor and the whole class in order to be publicly humiliated. The professor's intent was to shame his brash young student into behaving. This tactic, however, did not make Richard's father happy. ","In a scathing letter to Dean Thomas Mulledy, Claiborne Gooch denounced his son's treatment as a, disgraceful punishment...to the amusement of the whole class. Any humiliation of his son, he fumed, would not be tolerated. Gooch reminded Mulledy, in a not-so-subtle way, that college was a luxury he had decided to pay for against his better judgment, and was therefore owed some measure of influence. Gooch acknowledged that sending his oldest son Richard to college was the right decision. In Philip's case, however, Gooch had taken particular pains in letting Mulledy know what kind of trouble his youngest child could cause and the best way to deal with him. Those instructions had their limits, however. Any attempt to disgrace him in the estimation of his fellows or to blunt his sensibilities must have a tendency to defeat the very objects I had in view in putting him under your care, Gooch wrote.","In the 1830's, when the Gooch boys attended Georgetown, the University was a primarily Southern institution. As Claiborne Gooch's letter of protest demonstrates, college was not the same place it is today. Parents expected to get what they paid for from an opulent college education - and any type of humiliation of their gentlemen-in-training was out of the question."],"display_date":"April 13, 1837","search_date":"1837-04-13","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2159,"title":"Southern Medicine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-09","end_date":"1860-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 6, 1860, Benjamin Leonard Covington Wailes, a white planter in Washington, Adams County, Mississippi, wrote a diary entry describing his son's experiences at a northern medical school. According to Wailes, his son, who attended an unspecified medical school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, resisted all efforts and persuasions used to get him to go off from the medical college with the southern students, at least two hundred of which left for southern institutions in consequence of the political excitement gotten up by the Sectionalists and disunionists. Wailes then described his feelings on the situation, indicating that he was proud of his son for not giving in to social pressures and that he was disappointed in the young men who did head back South. He felt that the United States should not be in such a state of discontent and turmoil, but his opinion was unique because most southerners did want their children to return if they had traveled to the more advanced schools of the North. "," The fact that Wailes' son attended a northern medical school was generally looked down upon by southern people and especially southern practitioners. However, due to the fact that northern schools were more advanced, many southern students traveled to attend them. This was discouraged because the idea that southern medical practice was different than northern medical practice pervaded the minds of most southerners. This theory of medical regionalism was held due to the notion that medical practices had to closely relate to certain characteristics of the patient, such as moral status, ethnicity, and gender. More specific attributes such as the climate and population of where the patient hailed from were also taken into consideration. Due to this, practitioners of the nineteenth century believed in specificity, or that ideas appropriate for one situation were not appropriate in other contexts. The general population of the South also took this belief to heart. Thus, there were different medical practices in the North and the South and southern doctors and citizens disapproved when southern students went north to learn. "," The theory of medical regionalism was not enough to compel all southern students to only attend southern medical schools. Southern practitioners and citizens pushed the idea further by strengthening the southern commitment to cultural separatism through a promotion of the ideals of the South, saying that God had given them, and only them, the ability to do great things for the world. This idea was not fool-proof for keeping southern students in the South because Wailes' son and others still traveled north to attend medical school. Differing opinions among southerners regarding the idea of secession therefore not only affected the population in terms of politics, but spread through other areas of their culture, like education, as well. These differences of opinion were brought into the forefront as the Civil War loomed and it became the issues of normal life, such as receiving an education, which finally forced people to take a stance on how they felt regarding secession."],"display_date":"January 9, 1860","search_date":"1860-01-09","locations":[{"id":6926,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2173,"title":"Improving Schools in Augusta County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-07-28","end_date":"1842-07-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Pride was the driving force of Augusta County, Virginia- pride and patriotism not only for the country, but for the county as well. Augustan citizens therefore became quite disgruntled when one of the adjoining counties earned the venerable title, Athens of the Valley due to the assiduous efforts it made to improve its county's schools. One agitated Augusta resident in particular took it upon himself to rally his brethren to address the need to improve schools within Augusta. In an article he had published in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em>, this passionate citizen questioned the county's efforts in utilizing its resources to educate its children by asking, What are we doing for ourselves? Are we tutoring the minds of our youth up to the standard which would seem to befit our physical advantages? Furthermore, he delegated to the patrons and trustees of Augusta County schools the responsibility of giving energy to those who taught so that they could then stimulate their pupils.

Historians William J. Cooper and Thomas E. Terrill identify the reasons why Augusta County needed to make such an appeal in their novel depicting the history of the American South. They state that there was not a public school system in Augusta until 1853. Until then, Southern states instituted charity schools for those who could not afford to pay for education. In order to receive the services of these charity schools however, citizens would have to formally declare their inability to pay for education.

F. Nelson wrote a letter to his uncle on July 29, 1831 informing him of his son's academic progress and behavioral development over the course of the session. After naming classical studies and algebra as Cleland's primary interests of study, Nelson wrote that if his uncle decided to continue Cleland's schooling, he should begin the study of Geometry the following year and broaden the boy's curriculum.  Nelson also commented upon Cleland's behavior and observed that while the boy had proven deficient in application, [he] has...made some progress in supplanting old habits by those of more valuable character.  As a report, Nelson's letter strove both to establish the authority of Cleland's father while and emphasize his own positive role as an educator in Cleland's life. ","Letters containing progress reports were prevalent during this era in the South because education often times removed children from under the watchful eyes of their parents, particularly of their fathers.  In agrarian counties such as Albemarle County, wealthier families could afford to hire tutors to teach their children within the home, but most families were forced to send their children away because educational institutions were not available in rural regions. Cleland's father fell into this latter category and only received second-hand reports about his son's progress and deficient behavior. These letters therefore, became essential means by which fathers attempted to maintain a semblance of authority over their sons and, in a sense, over their sons' teachers; they had entrusted the care of their sons to the educational institution and expected to receive regular updates.  Jon L. Wakelyn surmises that southern fathers were traditionally hesitant to relinquish direct control over their children to the educational system because they recognized the inherent power the institution had to mold their children who would in turn shape the future society.  Fathers wanted to ensure that the patriarchal traditions of southern society were passed on to their children and thus, the educational system strove to acquiesce to the demands of the southern patriarchs.  Therefore, a healthy tension existed between the southern fathers and the educational system as both competed for the authority over the younger generation.","Southern fathers however, did not typically challenge the authority of the schools; rather fathers supported the system's rules and standards of conduct because they recognized educational achievement as a necessary ambition.  Cleland's father would have certainly maintained and appreciated Nelson's aid in curbing Cleland's bad habits and attempts to refine him as a young man of estimable character.  As a resident of Albemarle County, Cleland's father understood the value of a sold education because of the city of Charlottesville.  Both the home of the University of Virginia and a rising intellectual hub, Charlottesville embodied the importance of education within their aristocratic society. Wakelyn's analysis of antebellum family life supports this high estimation of education in the South. He argues that the fathers, as beacons of order and authority, had to subdue the sons and to channel their energies into useful endeavor, while sons simultaneously desired to prove their own independence; hence, it became clear that some form of accommodation as well as some outside institutional support were needed to keep the sons in line.  Thus, education was important to fathers because it both checked the ambition of their sons and characterized them as superior within the South's aristocratic society, molding them into the future patriarchs, social gentlemen, political leaders, and slave masters of the South."],"display_date":"July 29, 1831","search_date":"1831-07-29","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2207,"title":"Fighting in the Schoolyard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-01-10","end_date":"1873-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The schoolyard of the Colored Academy at Pine River was alive with excitement on the afternoon of the tenth of January, 1873. George Green, a sturdy young man of around eighteen years, attempted to kiss the little bronze beauty Roberta. When Professor Thomas Henaforth discovered what had transpired outside of his school, he set out to punish the mischievous youth. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Professor found Green and hit him over the head with a heavy cudgel, inflicting several open, bleeding wounds. The battle seemed to be a clear victory for the Professor until later that day when Green attacked him as he exited the building. Green triumphed in this round, beating Professor Henaforth until he yelled Nuff.","R. E. Porter, the Staunton Spectator's editor, drew four conclusions from this incident. Young darkies should take care in their efforts to kiss girls at school, as only the professors may claim this benefit. Schoolteachers should mind how they try to discipline the older male students since the stronger will win out in the battle. Women are responsible for all disobedience as they lead others into temptation. Finally, Porter suggested that if it had been a white professor assaulting a black student the incident would have gained much greater publicity, but since it occurred among individuals of the same race, it is not as notable."," Implicated in this incident are the state of the school systems in the Reconstruction South and the quality and character of race relations. The historian Eric Foner describes how public education collapsed during the Reconstruction as a result of widespread tax cuts, sinking to the point that a state governor considered it a luxury. Black students endured the worst of this educational ruin, but their situation was markedly better than it had been during slavery when education was altogether forbidden. The difference in the quality of education and the creation of a Colored Academy to separate the races revealed the tension between the black and white populations. The language used by Porter to describe those involved in the fight supports Foner's argument for the beginnings of the system of racial subordination, especially in Porter's description of Green as the brawny young Buck whose muscles have been developed at the plough handle and the anvil. White southerners still saw African Americans in terms of their roles during slavery, despite the new constitutional amendments guaranteeing equal rights. Although positioned as a professor at an educational institution, Porter impugned Henaforth's qualifications by suggesting sexual relations between a teacher and his students and placing Henaforth's title in quotations (Professor). Though the fifteenth amendment said it must be so, blacks were still not equal to whites in the eyes of the inhabitants of Augusta County."],"display_date":"January 10, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-10","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2221,"title":"Queen City Chautauqua Circle\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-01-01","end_date":"1887-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Queen City Chautauqua Circle was first formed in 1883 for intellectual discussion and learning in Springfield, Missouri. Its female members, like Mrs. O. A. Parish, directed and managed the self-proclaimed C.L.S.C. diligently and passionately until 1887, only to be replaced thereafter by another intellectual group with many of the same members, The Society of Friends Council. Mrs. O. A. Parish, the secretary for the Circle, kept detailed recordings of their meetings for most of this time period. The preamble for the Circle states that the female members of the C.L.S.C began to meet, for the purpose of mutual improvement, and that its members were uniting because of a mutual recognition of, the value of frequent interchanges of thought and experience. Historian Gail Collins notes that these groups typically functioned as, a sort of informal, do-it-yourself junior college system. The idea of doing something unrelated to their families was an enormous breakthrough. The 1886 C.L.S.C. record book stated that the women studied wide-ranging topics with everything from, the poetry of the Elizabethan Age, and philosophical discussions of, mind and matter to, the formation of coal beds, and the, Geology of the Atlantic Ocean. The women undertook these endeavors earnestly and with enthusiasm, each member presenting a different topic for discussion in any given meeting; Mrs. Tolfree, an active member of the C.L.S.C, for example, would present Current Events, while Mrs. Travers would be prepared to speak on Congressional Proceedings, once particular bills were made law. "," The late nineteenth century gave birth to a new, small triumph for southern women. Across America, pockets of female intellectuals gathered together in order to discuss everything from the most classical works of academia to current affairs. The Queen City Chautauqua Circle was one such gathering. By 1900, there were roughly 5,000 such groups that were part of the General Federation of Women's clubs alone, while hundreds more, like the Queen City Chautauqua Circle formed on their own. Gail Collins suggested that women at this time were, reaching for something beyond the household. In an apparently spontaneous movement, women's study clubs started popping up all over the country. In cities, small towns, and even some rural areas, middle class housewives organized themselves into groups to study current affairs, world history, or English literature. And, indeed, these intellectual support systems for women seemed popular in the South; a roster taken in 1885 by Mrs. O. A. Parish had as many as 23 female members recorded. "," Collins noted that the Civil War was an earlier turning point responsible for this new way of life for southern women. She said that at a time when, southern manhood, 'the mighty oak,' had been, 'hit by lightening,' women began to forge bonds with one another and take on new societal roles like never before. In the late nineteenth century of the Gilded Age, women were showing up in the workplace in both the North and the South, or taking more active roles in their communities while still taking care of their families-which was more often the case in the South."],"display_date":"1885 - 1887","search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":7853,"lat":37.8246035682,"lng":-92.2076649652,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2232,"title":"A Swindling Bookworm.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-09-03","end_date":"1897-12-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A man named William Mills Butler was arrested on September 3, 1896 in St. Louis, Missouri on the charge of mail fraud.

Taylor's plea, the students of Wake Forest University would not silence their political opinions.On the night of October 26, 1889, a Republican stump-speaking, literally delivering a speech from atop a freshly cut tree stump, occurred half-a-mile from campus. Fifty of Taylor's students attended the stump-speaking, led by Wake County native John Nichols, who was elected as an Independent to the United States House of Representatives in1886.  Nichols spoke for an hour, with two Wake Forest students asking permission to speak afterwards.  While Nichols speech was interrupted only by applause, the two students who spoke afterwards were interrupted by yells from the crowd because of the vulgar language they used.  ","What these students said exactly to anger the Republican crowd is unclear, but in Taylor's letter describing the event to John Wannamaker, General Postmaster of the Republican administration of Benjamin Harrison, he states his belief that, in the past, his students have taken no action to break up meetings of Republicans by behaving disorderly.  He had always advised his students to take no position in politics while they were in college, but could not stop his students from voicing their opinions.  At his University in Wake County, Taylor did not condone the discussion of politics among faculty and students, and even had some Republicans on his staff.","As historian Edward L. Ayers states in his book, <em>Promise of the New South, Life After Reconstruction</em>, the politics of Redemption did not eliminate the Republican Party from competing with Democrats for power in the South.  By the mid-1880's, the Republican Party, after considerable losses between 1872-1876, began to make slow gains in several Southern states including North Carolina.  With Democrat Grover Cleveland's 1885 accession to the White House amidst Republican domination of the office since the 1860's, Democrats only found themselves held to higher standards and stricter criticism.  Jefferson Davis's death gave Democrats further cause to reexamine the organization and principles of their party, as new, young leaders such as these students at Wake Forest University, began to assume leadership roles and fill the generational gap between pre and postwar Democrats."],"display_date":"October 26, 1889","search_date":"1889-10-26","locations":[{"id":9846,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2265,"title":"Educational Improvements in North Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-03-08","end_date":"1876-03-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mary Graves never imagined that she would be offered a teaching position in Caswell County when she visited as a guest preacher to local Presbyterian congregations from her Leesburg, Virginia home in 1876.Yet, Mary was offered a teaching position, and to her own surprise, left her home in Leesburg and moved to Caswell County to begin her teaching career.

Many of the boys clutched baseball bats, gloves, and catcher's masks in anticipation of baseball practice later that afternoon. On the back of the keepsake photograph, someone had scribbled Cluster Springs High School Baseball Team, over the words Cluster Springs Academy. The photograph dates back to the turn of the century, around 1900, when secondary education began to change in the United States, specifically in the state of Virginia.","A pamphlet entitled <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> published in the beginning of the twentieth century told the story of a Virginia preparatory school located a half a mile from Cluster Springs on the Durham Division of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, approximately six miles from South Boston, Virginia. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> is a brochure that not only discussed the history of the Academy but also marked the school to potential students and their families. Many pages were devoted to discussing the benefits of the 150 wooded acres, the famous mineral springs, and the mild climate; the mild climate makes it possible for the students to indulge in some form of outdoor sport every week in the year. One page of the pamphlet was a testament to the school's athletics reputation especially in the sport of baseball where the record was one of the best among the preparatory schools in the state. In terms of academics, the pamphlet quoted that without any form of testing or examination 75 percent of students continued in schools of higher education. ","Virginia's education system was beginning to make several changes at the end of the nineteenth century including the growth of the secondary education system as a whole, the inclusion of specific educational requirements, and growth in attendance. For example by 1914, in some Virginia counties, such as Halifax County, there were as many as three public high school districts. At the end of the nineteenth century, there were also lists of recommended textbooks, courses, and subjects for public high schools published by several authors. Another important fact was the growth in attendance in secondary schools. Although the growth was not consistent from 1890 to 1900, the number of pupils increased from 9,124 to 11,736. Even though these were numbers and trends for public schools, the private school enrollment was about the same as the public secondary schools. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> made the claim that Cluster Springs Academy is an example of evolution in the world of education, and the history of Virginia education proved the claim true."],"display_date":1900,"search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":13902,"lat":36.7669669152,"lng":-78.9366405787,"zoom":9,"place":"HALIFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2277,"title":"A Dissenting Voice\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-07-09","end_date":"1837-07-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Unmarried and living on the La Grange plantation in northeast Florida, Ellen Brown could no longer tolerate her brother's inconsistencies on matrimony. Mannevillete Brown believed marriage to be an ultimatum-the great aim of women and last public act before retreating into domestic life. But Mannevillete also spoke of marrying for money, station, and power. How did he then reconcile his speech on a woman's motives if he just claimed that publicity is their only aim? Ellen derided her brother in a letter and blatantly challenged his concept of southern patriarchal order. Mannevillete did not have the right to assume he knew women and their motivations better than she did. Ellen claims he is just as anxious as all women to marry, but she did not accuse him, as he did her, of making it the business of his life. ","Moreover, marriage was more complicated than Mannevillete made it out to be. The concept of marrying well was influenced by many factors-by love, money, property, morals, and the peace of families. Mannevillete did not make inconsistencies agree. Ellen asked him to allow her to make her own decisions towards marriage. To this end, she humbly opined and apologized for her prolixity. ","Ellen Brown's voice was one of dissent in a suppressive society dominated by males. She was part of a larger migration of wealthy, New England families to the Florida frontier seeking opportunity. The Browns, including her sister Corinna, meshed with the social elite of Jacksonville and St. Augustine. They became family friends with David Levy Yulee and Judge Thomas Douglas, influential policymakers at the time. Thus, the Brown sisters came under tremendous systemic pressure to marry well. They were vibrant, young, northern-born women, educated, and literate. Their eloquent correspondence is evidence of pressure against customary social norms which would increase in intensity from the early nineteenth century through the Civil war and Reconstruction. ","In the early 1800's, the doctrine of separate spheres, the cult of domesticity, and the cult of single blessedness were widely held beliefs and concepts in the South. Men and women occupied separate and exclusive spheres of influence, one external and societal, the other internal and domestic. Women could not vote, hold property in most circumstances, or engage in economic transactions; husbands acted as brokers for their interests (coverture). Marriage was a way to gain status and influence through males, but single southern women, such as Ellen, could also carve a special niche in society, that of the maiden aunt who was blessedly single. An aging single woman, the maiden aunt, cared for family members and children in times of sickness and death and maintained a close-knit family through communication. These maiden aunts were especially close with their brothers, such as Mannevillete, who offered male companionship and attention, as well as outlets for political discourse and debate.","The Civil War and Reconstruction offered even more opportunities for women to expand their spheres of influence and redefine their roles in society. The percentage of single women had already begun to rise in 1830 and increased with the loss of thousands of men in the Civil War. Southern households were transformed. With the removal of slavery, women assumed new domestic duties but also moved outside that realm to become schoolteachers in new public and private school systems. In all these changes, women began to have a choice: choice of marriage, choice of profession, and choice of civic responsibility. Marriage was expected, but single women of the elite classes were not universally exiled to the periphery of southern society; they found meaningful roles to fill within the family and later, civic life. The correspondence of Ellen and Corinna Brown is more of an anomaly-atypical and unrepresentative of the whole of southern women. The Brown sisters were incredibly intelligent and well-educated, having the time and resources to write and preserve their daily opinions, thus offering a glimpse of social norms in flux. Most southern women were not so privileged. Still, as more women began to choose to be single, they helped shape their futures more than societal forces that once constrained them."],"display_date":"July 9, 1837","search_date":"1837-07-09","locations":[{"id":1324,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2278,"title":"Brown&#39;s Speech to Congress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-06-17","end_date":"1844-06-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Looking out over the twenty eighth Congress, Mr. A.V. Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee. Just as with Maine, Missouri, and other territories admitted during the period, politicians sought to maintain a tenuous balance of power. Admission of Florida became more attractive as the application for statehood of a free territory, Iowa, appeared on the horizon and came up in 1846. Less than a year after Brown's speech, on March 3, 1845, Florida became the twenty seventh state of the Union."],"display_date":"June 17, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2297,"title":"Three Women Graduate from the Women&#39;s Medical College of Baltimore\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-05-02","end_date":"1888-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Women's Medical College of Baltimore in Maryland held its sixth ever graduation ceremony in the afternoon on May 2, 1888.

Sam advised his son to pursue the profession of medicine. As Sam explained it, becoming a doctor would not prevent him from being a farmer. Rather, Sam found it vitally in your advantage to be acquainted with the science of medicine, and it is an easy profession to acquire. According to historian James Volo, the medical profession in the antebellum period thought of itself as knowledgeable and humanitarian, but its practitioners were neither selective in their methods nor well regulated by their fellows. Such methods were still based upon medieval concepts and home remedies. A country doctor-which William would be if he returned to Clark County, Alabama-was even less advanced in practical methods due to the lack to intellectual stimulation from living in rural areas. In other words, even though studying to become a doctor would be respectable and considered knowledgeable for William, it would still be an easy profession, as Sam stated, for him to acquire.","Sam Forwood's reasoning behind his advice was that he knew about the hardships that farmers in Alabama faced at the time. As William Rogers explains, in Alabama, one of the states making up the Cotton Kingdom, the fluctuation of cotton prices, the higher cost of purchasing goods in a protected market, and the lack of economic development and diversification contribute to the unsettled economic conditions that characterized the time. The uncertainty of farming - when it would rain, how much it would rain, etc. - dominated letters among antebellum southern planters. Sam Forwood himself exclaimed anxiety about his crop of cotton being small, yet hopefully highly priced. Focusing on another profession, William Forwood could ease his dependence on this lifestyle of ambiguity. Although doctors belonged to what would be considered the white elite class, they still depended upon the agricultural success of the Cotton Kingdom. Certainly, doctors were a very separate occupation, which only served to build up the resources in a local society. Nevertheless, such occupations still depended on Alabama's economic vitality, which undoubtedly depended on cotton. With this in mind, William could still find time for farming-that occupation upon which southern society hinged. William Forwood did take his father's advice. In 1848, he returned to Alabama to pursue the medical profession.

First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2351,"title":"The Principles of the Alliance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-04-19","end_date":"1888-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Widowed and with few options available to support herself, Dolly Lang, a black widow living in Falls County, Texas, signed a sharecropping contract with Mrs. V.C. Billingsley on January 9, 1889. The contract specified that Lang agreed to lease around 48 acres of land previously rented by her husband Ellis Lang and on which she currently lived. The land was to be used for growing cotton. Consequently, the agreed upon rental price was the first three bales of cotton produced from the land each year, each having to weigh in at five hundred pounds. The lease agreement was stated to expire at the end of the year unless otherwise agreed to by Mrs. V.C. Billingsley.","Farm tenancy, the division of land to be rented and farmed by individuals, had been a practice in Texas since the colonial period; however, the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of slaves caused a boom in farm tenancy across the southeastern United States as the demand for both agricultural labor and employment skyrocketed. Initially, sharecropping seemed to be an excellent solution for both those with land and those without; yet eventually, it became evident that sharecropping created a dangerous cycle of debt and, at times, the abuse of power by the traditionally white landowner over the poor black and white sharecroppers. Sharecropping quickly became the most common farm tenant arrangement, one in which the tenant did not receive his or her payment, typically given as a share of the crops, until the crops were harvested and turned into the landowner. Through this system, the landowner still exercised a great degree of power, illustrated by the terms of Lang's contract.","Being a sharecropper was a risky business as many were left with no profit after paying back debts incurred during the growing season. This caused the sharecropper to start off the next growing season already indebted to merchants or the landowner and facing the additional challenge of an uphill battle against the unknowns of Mother Nature. Cotton was particularly popular for the high prices it fetched, yet it seeped all of the nutrients out of the soil starting a succession of diminishing returns. When this happened, sharecroppers frequently had to decrease their crop yield and were unable to seek out more fertile land as state laws mandated they remain on the property until they paid off their debts. Landowners and local merchants often took advantage of sharecroppers, many of whom were still illiterate, and maintained economic control. Indeed, because of the way in which sharecroppers were caught in a cycle of debt and were at the mercy of landowners, Claudine Ferrell refers to sharecropping as a form of economic slavery in her book <em>Reconstruction</em>.","While many poor white men also made a living as sharecroppers, a disproportionately high amount of blacks took part in the practice. Life as a tenant farmer was certainly not as grim as it had been for blacks living in slavery; black men and women technically had the ability to spend their time, money and energy as they so desired. Still, as Reconstruction came to a formal close in 1877, the plantation system remained firmly entrenched and many white landowners saw overseeing sharecroppers as a variation of the duties they had retained during slavery. The landowner maintained control over the individuals on his property and thus a relationship based on domination and vulnerability persisted between many blacks and whites in the South. Regardless of the inequity it perpetuated, sharecropping shaped the economic and social atmosphere of much of the agricultural South long after Reconstruction ended and on through the Depression."],"display_date":"April 19, 1888","search_date":"1888-04-19","locations":[{"id":12543,"lat":31.0376697014,"lng":-97.4782357231,"zoom":9,"place":"BELL, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2359,"title":"A Typical Monday for Mary Austin Holley\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-02-26","end_date":"1838-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In her diary Mary Austin Holley jotted down the events of her afternoon with friends.

Holley wrapped up the account of her delightful afternoon by recognizing Mr. Wharton as a cultured gentleman and Mrs. Wharton as all that a lady should be. ","In the early stages of Texas colonization, most of the colonists were like Holley and the Whartons: ladies and gentlemen from the American South.

Her education made her interested in rare editions of books and figures in Mexican history. Holley appreciated the finer things in life and put emphasis on the importance of being a gentleman or lady. ","The ladies of the antebellum South revealed an important aspect of southern class hierarchy. In his book Soul by Soul, Walter Johnson describes the white upper class as a society made by slaves. Wives of slaveholders demonstrated this particularly well because the mark of a gentile lady was the leisure time she had to engage in pleasantries. She could not have this leisure time without the help of domestic servants, thus her slaves made her a lady. These women's husbands also benefited from their wives' leisure time. It became a credit to a man's reputation to have a wife that did not work.

The Methodists were one of the Christian denominations more accepting of leadership among women though they usually prohibited women from gaining official denominational positions.

Next a black witness was asked to take the stand. James Hall, a wealthy African American planter, was summoned to Birmingham to give a testimony concerning the state of blacks in Mobile.

The school aimed to enhance the labor skills of newly freed blacks. The state chartered 15,000 towards the school, but still needed more funds. The board of trustees purchased three hundred acres of land with an estimated worth of 2800 in yielded crops. Yet it did not yet have the bare essentials needed to function. Over 100 pupils attended the school, the rooms were not big enough to accommodate the students, and there were not enough farming instruments for the use of the school's manufacturing and mechanical branches. The board acknowledged Watkins's appeals and sent agents north to seek assistance and support. "," Seeking assistance in the North was necessary because support within their own state was not likely. After congress passed the fourteenth amendment granting citizenship to African Americans July of 1868, many Tennesseans became furious. Riots broke out. Radical conservatives established group aimed to terrorize African Americans called the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Robert Corlew reported that Troops were necessary to stop atrocious murders and numerous outrages which had been committed by violent and disloyal men. "," In response to such violent outcries, Congress worked fast to design the Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans survive among the chaos. They distributed food, supervised contracts, and established schools. This bureau offered government and abandoned land as a refuge and by December of 1968, already established the Manual Labor School in Rutherford, Tennessee. They created the school to help African Americans develop labor skills in order to function in society and intended to have enough classrooms as well as tools they could use for practice. Education was so popular among African Americans because they had never before had the opportunity to receive it. With such a large turnout of students, the original allotted funds for the school were not sufficient. "," Schools for African Americans in the South had trouble receiving sufficient funds because they were surrounded by so much opposition to their cause, yet the eagerness of African Americans to learn was the key to starting educational institutions. According to Stephen Hahn, the burdens of establishing and running schools fell chiefly to the freed people themselves. They had to pool their meager resources, rent or purchase a tract of land, build a schoolhouse, and hire a teacher. By 1867 African Americans composed about one-third of the teachers in freedman's schools, and was growing. Those dedicated to receiving more funds had to lobby to northerners for support. Republican leaders of the Freedman's bureau made great attempts to respond to the requests of the newly freed blacks, hoping to receive their votes once they learned about the voting process, but it was difficult because there just was not a lot of money to give.

The Reverend John Witherspoon Pettigrew McKenzie founded the school and was also its headmaster. Malcolm H. Addison attended McKenzie College and like most college students both past and present, he received letters from his parents. For Addison, the subject of these letters inevitably turned to a questioning of the status of his soul. For months Addison dashed his parent's hopes saying that he had not found religion. It was not until March 4, 1849 that Addison officially proclaimed his life changing experience to his parents. He told his parents of a great revival at his school and the conversion of two of his roommates. He then confessed that he too had found religion was surprised at how easily it had come to him. ","Education and religion were closely linked in this period. As the need for institutions of learning increased, churches rose to challenge by establishing schools. Many saw it as one of the duties of the church to provide a Christian education for young people. To ensure this, most teachers hired in schools throughout Texas were pastors. Rupert N. Richardson also points out that even schools not under church control generally maintained religious environments. At McKenzie college religion was incorporated into the academic curriculum and daily life. The students were required to attend chapels and have prayers at 4:00 AM. The school also held revivals, and this was where Addison was converted. ","The insistency of Addison's parents in inquiring about his spiritual life shows how great a concern religion was. When Protestantism took root in Texas in the 1830s, many Evangelical Christians began to place emphasis on the role of family religion. It was important for parents to be religious role models and communicate to their children the ways in which God was working in their everyday lives. Donald G. Mathews summarizes the purpose of family religion as, nurturing children so that when they came to adulthood they would be susceptible to conversion. For this reason the concern of Addison's parents is understandable. Not only did they want their son to go to heaven, but they also wanted to make sure they had not failed in their duties as Christian parents. Addison's series of correspondences is an example of how high a priority religion was in the antebellum South. Religion permeated all aspects of daily life from education to personal correspondence.

However, these brief words held powerful meaning. The fact that a professor would do anything to endanger the lives of his pupils was certainly grounds for dismissal. Moreover, the document held no clue as to the outcome of the allegations. "," As stated above, fifty-three students chose to sign their names to the petition. Of these names, there were originally two more, which someone apparently scratched out. In addition, the signers underlined a few of their names, as if to emphasize the signer's commitment to the cause."," Unfortunately, educators like Professor Jones were everywhere in Mississippi throughout history; the state has long struggled with the establishment of a strong system of education. According to historian John Ray Skates, it was not a primary concern even at the would-be state's territorial beginnings. In fact, he writes, Formal education in the territory was scarcely available and public education was nonexistent. As a result, those who could afford to employed tutors or took advantage of out-of-state boarding schools in order to educate their children, and those who could not used methods of home schooling. Clearly, problems plagues even the few schools Mississippi did have, and uncaring and criminal teachers like Jones certainly did not help solve these. As time progressed, education still did not take a chief role in the society of Mississippi, as it did in other parts of the United States. Outside events squelched any attempts to formalize education in the state. Although the University of Mississippi, a public university, was established in 1848, it soon had to shut down because of the Civil War. Finally, building on this idea of public education, Skates notes that, The constitution of 1868 mandated public schools for all children in the state, thus insuring the first statewide system of public education in Mississippi's history. Although a slow and arduous process, Mississippians were finally granted the same opportunities for education that existed elsewhere in the United States.

North Carolina produced white female graduates who could bring scholastic knowledge to the affairs pertaining to wives and mothers in 1847. ","      The article attested to the paradoxical nature of antebellum female education inasmuch as it professed to develop and cultivate the intellect and give dignity to the mind while at the same time prescribing limited roles for women in society.  The examinations of Spring 1847 occurred in the midst of an Intellectual Awakening which had begun in 1839 with the spread of free common schools for white children.  From the age of ten onwards, however, white men and women received different educations.  Women were encouraged in domestic skills and were less eligible for college education.  Greensboro Female College itself was only established through the patronage of the Methodist Church, and could not have been sustained by the State.  ","Anya Jabour, in her work with the family letters of the southern slaveholding U.S. Attorney General William Wirt, exposes more of the paradoxes to female education.  While Wirt encouraged his many daughters to rigorous standards in academia, he wrote to one daughter in 1820 that an intelligent Woman may be admired but she will never be beloved. Jabour's work correlates with the notion that a female education was considered valuable only in so much as it catered to femininity rather than intellect.  In so much as women were encouraged to develop their intellect, Jabour suggests it is to the extent that doing so improved their marriage options.

The founding of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute ushered in a new era for African American education in Alabama and the nation. Booker T. Washington began his career the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, under General Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Washington's keen mind and brilliant thoughts got the attention of General Armstrong who begrudgingly mentioned Washington's abilities to George Campbell, a citizen of Tuskegee and president of the Board of Trustees at the Tuskegee Institute. Campbell, a former slave owner, was working through specifics with both Lewis Adams and State officials in Alabama to create an institute of higher learning and trade, primarily for African American pupils. Campbell sought the leadership of a strong black figure and found it in Washington.","The Institute was lucky to have many legislative allies. Two white senators, W.F. Foster and A.L. Brooks, were so enamored with the idea of the Tuskegee Institute that they sought to secure its future by acquiring state funding for the project. Foster and Brooks were able to urge the appropriation of two-thousand dollars worth of state funds for teachers' salaries. Teachers' salaries were just the tip of the iceberg. The school lacked land, buildings and faculty members. When Washington arrived in Tuskegee in June of 1881, the Institute was extremely disorganized. In a mere month, in preparation for the grand opening, Washington managed to secure a single school building and several other necessities. Later Washington wrote in his journal, I opened the school...in an old church and a little shanty that was almost ready to fall down from decay.","It was evident that the only way to sustain the Tuskegee Institute was with more funding. Washington was forced to ask for every resource. He petitioned his friend Mr. Francis Chickering Briggs asking, My first great need is apparatus, such as maps writing-charts, globes. I thought by writing to you I might get a great many of these kid of thing which you would not miss there. He continued his quest, writing James Fowle Baldwin Marshall; Dear Friend: Please send me the addresses of some publishing houses where I can get my books at reduced rates. Over the years, Washington's fund-raising efforts paid off and the Tuskegee Institute, which opened its dilapidated doors to 37 students in July of 1881, grew significantly. At Washington's death in 1915, the Institute had 1,500 students, a two million dollar endowment, and instruction in forty trades, one-hundred fully-equipped buildings, and about 200 faculty members.","The founding of the Tuskegee Institute was important to blacks, not only in Alabama but also the South. The Institute provided an education in particular trades and this specialized education enabled blacks to better themselves and their socioeconomic status by providing employment opportunities in the wake of slavery and servitude. Blacks from all reaches of the South and even into the North traveled to Tuskegee to enroll and learn in an environment conducive to progressive race relations. Tolerance of education for blacks started to increase on July 4, 1881 and would continue to climb due to the addition of the Tuskegee Institute to the antebellum landscape of Alabama.

Dr. Edson believed X-rays would accomplish the same for an atrophied optic nerve. Before the treatment, Martin could only discern the difference between night and day.

Discoveries occurred in germ theory, the importance of inoculation, and use of anesthesia for surgery. The founding of medical schools and the first health advisory board occurred. Most importantly for John Martin, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered x-rays in November 1895, only about a year before Dr. Edson used them to cure blindness. X-rays became widely popular very quickly for burning moles, treating acne and lupus vulgaris, and carcinomas in various organs. Extended exposure to x-rays left the skin browned and sometimes burned, only nurturing the developing idea that brown skin is healthier than white. Bynum does not cite the use of x-rays for eye problems, but Dr. Edson recognized the potential for x-rays for other health issues. Staunton was a small city with only 7,289 inhabitants in 1900, but within one of the most populous counties in Virginia. In 1886, one newspaper even ran an article boasting of the city's attributes: electricity, lights, telephones, music band, and opera house. Now, the city could boast that they had a doctor current to the science of the world because of their connections to other cities and states from the railroad that ran through it and telegraphs.

The conference on race relations to be held in Montgomery, Alabama was a highly anticipated event. The political affair would bring to town many of the nation's finest orators and most distinguished authorities on the subject of race. On May 8, 1900, the Montgomery Auditorium hosted the conference, which included various speeches on racial issues from greater educational opportunities for blacks in the country to a repeal of the fifteenth amendment. The front page of the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> celebrated the conference's turnout: LARGE AUDIENCES ASSEMBLE TO HEAR THE DISTINGUISED ORATORS PRESENT THEIR VIEWS. "," In the midst of the conference on race relations in Montgomery, one article in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> pleaded with the state to recognize the needs of poor whites in Alabama before attempting to better the position of blacks. This editorial, Industrial Education for White Boys in Alabama, specifically addressed the educational crisis in Alabama. The editorial cited the 1890 formation of an industrial institution in Tennessee as an example of a thousand fold return to the state in terms of citizenship. The article rallied, People of Alabama, where are your thousand boys? On the waste heap it is feared. The <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> editorial emphasized Alabama's educational emergency and called for a statewide reform, thus challenging the existing model of education in the state. "," The educational deficiencies in Alabama at the beginning of the twentieth century took root in statewide politics. White Democrats regained political power throughout Alabama during what was known as the Bourbon years (1874-1890). The moniker recalled the House of Bourbon's restoration after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The Democratic Bourbons immediately enacted measures to reduce the state debt and as a result funding for education decreased. In one swift political decision the Democrats eliminated the State Board of Education and significantly reduced both educational appropriations and constitutional guarantees of financial support. According to historian William Rogers, The Democrats opted for decentralization in control of educational affairs. "," These sixteen years of Bourbon rule would impact the statewide educational system into the twentieth century. Until 1891 Alabama schools were awarded funding based on the number of students by race. According to Rogers, townships could appropriate funds based on an amount they might deem just and equitable. This subjective appropriation of funding led to inadequate funding for black schools. However, blacks were not the only students suffering in Alabama. In 1900, there were 104,883 illiterate whites aged ten years or older living across Alabama. At 338,605, the illiteracy was significantly higher for blacks in the state, but these alarming numbers in both categories demonstrated a failed system. In his Bourbon Democracy in Alabama, Allen Going evaluates Alabama's educational system in light of Bourbon politics. He writes, The condition of Alabama schools, however, in comparison with those in other parts of the country was poor indeed. In 1890, the state ranked fourth from the bottom in a listing of various school statistics for all states by the Federal commissioner of education. When the editorial in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> ran ten years later in 1900, the effects of the Bourbon Democrats lingered throughout Alabama. The educational deficiencies and resultant illiteracy rates at the beginning of the twentieth century resulted from a laissez-faire state government.

Would the Chicago news reach her parents back home in Tuscumbia before she made it home to tell them in person? On May 17, 1890, the Chicago Tribune ran a special on the miraculous case of Helen Keller; a blind, deaf and dumb child from Alabama. Keller's wealthy parents had sent her up north to a special institution for the blind. According to the article, Keller's parents had heard of the great progress made by another student, Laura Bridgman, and hoped for the same results for Helen. Her success however, far exceeded that of Ms. Bridgman and in the first year Helen acquired a vocabulary of 3,000 words. Her teacher, Miss Fuller, gave her instruction as to how to place her tongue and the child would feel of her teacher's throat and lips when she was talking, thus learning the mechanical elements of articulation. The Tribune reported that Helen subsequently spoke quite readily and praised her remarkable accomplishments. After announcing Helen's feat to the entire city of Chicago, the Tribune concluded, The child has kept her wonderful recovery of speech secret, as she wishes to surprise her parents, whom she is to visit in the South soon. "," Born a healthy baby in Tuscumbia on June 27, 1880, a fever rendered Keller deaf and blind at the age of eighteen months old. Despite all odds, Helen Keller had achieved an international reputation even before studying under Sarah Fuller in 1890. By 1888, at the tender age of eight, Keller was recognized in the Chicago Tribune for her wonderful power. The article spoke of Helen's education in Tuscumbia with Miss Anne Mausfueld Sullivan. At the age of seven, Helen's parents hired Miss Sullivan to teach the child in Alabama. Subsequently, Helen traveled north to continue her education with another teacher, Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School. Helen Keller's story became a widely recognized and heartwarming tale by the turn of the century and her dedication to learning earned her both a spot in the public eye and that of history. "," Helen Keller's first educational breakthrough occured at home in Tuscumbia. Why then would her parents then send her away from Alabama to continue her learning? The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind was established in the 1860s and served as a special needs school close to home. And yet, Keller traveled north to further her education at various private institutions including the prestigious Horace Mann School. Though Keller proved an exceptional case with respect to her achievements in education, she was not alone in her journey north to further her schooling. Many wealthy Alabama natives sent their children north at the end of the nineteenth century in search of higher education. The ill-defined school system and educational deficiencies throughout Alabama led many to look outside the state for higher educational purposes. Furthermore, racial segregation throughout the South created similar education problems as those faced in Alabama. State biographer William Rogers observes, In Alabama, as in the rest of the South, the problems of educational support were compounded by the decision to establish parallel institutions for whites and blacks. Due to racial tensions throughout the South, many southern families turned north for the best educational opportunities. If families had the private funds to find the best education available, many southerners looked north during times of educational and racial turmoil in the South.

The Tuskegee Institution invited the black community to witness what work the school has turned out, how that work is accomplished, and what is the character of the general population in which the raw material comes. Gathered in the hall were, perhaps a thousand colored people...mainly old-timers... including many who had journeyed more than 30 miles to view the spectacle. The audience listened to lesson recitals during the morning sessions and rhetorical exercises during the afternoon with perfect delight. The article also paid significant tribute to the inspiration behind the school, Principle Booker T. Washington. Washington, a man of unusual force and ability for any race, grew the school from the ground up with the aid of seed money from the state in the amount of 2,000. From this grant in 1881, Washington founded his school in a church with 30 students and one teacher. By 1887, the year the <em>New York Times</em> reported on the school, Tuskegee had grown to 275 students. With awe and reverence, the <em>New York Times</em> chronicled this communal gathering and paid their editorial respects to Washington for such a tremendous educational achievement. "," A vital piece of Alabama history lies in the foundation of the Tuskegee Institution. The institute's creation was intrinsically tied to Alabama state politics. The Bourbon Democrats gained control throughout Alabama between the years of 1874-1900. According to historian Allen Goings, the Democrats seized political control of Alabama in 1874 by waging a strenuous campaign based almost exclusively on the race issue. In strategic political move, W.F. Foster, a Democratic candidate for the Alabama Senate, traded black votes with a promise to create a school for the African American community. Under Washington's leadership Tuskegee admitted its first class of 30 students in 1881. Washington had his students build the Tuskegee Institution with their own hands to prove labor as both practical and dignified. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, in advocating hard work and teaching practical skills, Washington hoped to see his race rise through gradual and nonconfrontational change. "," Through Tuskegee, the nation witnessed the beginnings of racial change. <em>The New York Times</em> praised the creation of Tuskegee in the middle of one of the darkest and most hopeless parts of the South. Booker T. Washington had a vision of his black community rising through the ranks of society and Tuskegee proved a first step. Despite all that was in store for the black community in the South, the Tuskegee Institution proved a foundation for social change.

By earning his degree, Mr. Duke entered the ranks of college educated southerners that day in Charlottesville.","In the wake of the Civil War, many colleges and universities throughout the South had lost faculty, income, and property. However, the war also brought a huge supply of experienced Confederate soldiers and officers who knew how to lead and to run an operation. These men quickly entered the administrations of southern colleges and universities. Many advocated scientific training to help rebuild the South and make up for weaknesses demonstrated by the Civil War. Duke represented a part of southern male society committed to self-improvement, even if not through the sciences. Increasingly such men as Duke turned to progress, or the idea of perpetual self improvement as the key to their own and the South's future. Robert E. Lee, as president of Washington College, was the most famous of these administrators. Lee expressed the trend toward sciences when he convinced Cyrus McCormick to fund Washington College's hiring of Richard Sears McCulloh who had worked in the Confederate Nitre and Mining Bureau.Furthermore in 1871 the University of Alabama extended study to include mathematics and hard sciences. However lack of money precluded the lofty goals of many scientifically oriented southern ","administrators. Such financial problems occurred at Washington and Lee after Robert E. Lee's death, and at the University of Alabama. ","Administrators who advocated scientific courses at the University of North Carolina, South Carolina College, Louisiana State University and the University of Mississippi were sometimes grouped together by opponents with politicians who favored integration to the detriment of their cause. Southern academics who survived the end of Reconstruction did so by advocating separate schools for African Americans, or none at all. Thus across the South after the Civil War a struggle raged among administrators over the course of southern higher education. These advocates of science competed for funding with more traditional programs in military training, which remained widespread after the Civil War. They also presented a unique view of history in their teaching, as the outcome of the Civil War became inevitable because of the overwhelming strength of the Union Army. These administrators argued that ex-Confederates had fought to exhaustion and maintained that their fight had been an honorable defense of the Constitution, not slavery.

W.D. Cabell, a graduate of the University of Virginia and principal of the Norwood High School in Nelson County, Virginia, was just such a man. In his journal he often pondered the effect his own life would have on those around him, and beseeched the Lord for help in doing good works. In 1867, Cabell decided to use his position as principal of Norwood High School to help those he saw as most in need: disabled ex-Confederate soldiers. The normal tuition for one semester at his school came to 150; he offered 12 spots at half price for those who met the following conditions:","I. Satisfactory evidence that he is unable to meet the expense of a full academic course,","II. That he was disabled in the discharge of his duty as a Southern soldier,","III. The he will, when his course is completed, engage in the cause of education as a teacher, and give to some poor, honest boy an equivalent for the advantages now offered to him,","IV. That if this is impracticable, he will, as soon as he is able, pay the balance of the regular rates of the school, but without interest.","Cabell identifies himself as thoroughly and permanently identified with the cause of southern education, and as such takes it upon himself to make his charitable offer only to those that are held in high esteem by the fallen southern aristocracy, such as ex-Confederate soldiers. He contends that I confine this offer to no particular state or locality, and in discriminating between applicants will decide (other things equal) in favor of the most unfortunate. He does not, however, extend this offer to other destitute southern citizens, such as newly freed blacks, and thus still reflects the limited moral attitudes of his time. ","According to Fred Arthur Bailey, author of Free Speech and the Lost Cause in the Old Dominion, Southern teachers after the Civil War attempted to inject the Lost Cause mentality into school curricula within the entire South, including Virginia. Once established as the arbiters of Southern thought, Bailey asserts, they expunged offending works from schools and libraries, silenced dissident teachers, and indoctrinated Southern children with antebellum aristocratic social values. The ideas of the Lost Cause range from old southern ideas of chivalry and honor to race and gender relations and roles within society. Also, an integral part of the Lost Cause idea was the portrayal of the South as a valiant yet defeated region now forced to live under corrupt Yankee rule, whose ideals and social mores must not be lost in favor of northern values. Although the specific curriculum from the Norwood School is not available, it's very possible that Cabell fit this description to some degree. He obviously sympathized greatly the Confederacy, and was a self-proclaimed champion of Southern Education.

The abundance of disease contributed greatly to a negative stereotype of the entire region. Yellow fever and malaria were the two most terrifying diseases that were prone to the South. During the Civil War, more Americans died of disease than from wounds received in battle. Though this was common for wars before the twentieth century, the sheer number of sick soldiers bears some relation to the diseases prevalent in the South. Union soldiers suffered particularly from malaria because they had no immunity to it. After the Civil War, diseases like yellow fever and malaria made the health situation worse. The overwhelming poverty in the states of the former Confederacy brought about a spike in disease. Hookworm and tuberculosis also crept up after the Civil War as the post-war South gave birth to cities with poor public health, and widespreadrural poverty. E.J.

Unlike the stereotypical image of the upper class southern belle isolated on a large plantation, Fannie studied Latin and Greek every day until she could leave the farm and attend the prestigious Mary Sharpe School in Winchester, Tennessee.  Her father, a wealthy planter, and brother opposed her decision due to her young age, but she persisted until they sent her to college.  Fannie's pictures and biographies of women's suffrage leaders such as Susan B. Anthony showed that she intended to use her education.Mary Sharpe College in Winchester, Tennessee opened in 1853 with the statement a statement of purpose that read: educate the mothers and you educate the world.  Even though this statement of purpose seemed patronizing, Mary Sharpe offered women the best classical education in the South.  It was a competitive college that required that young women take four years of Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Only the wealthiest planter families could afford to send their daughters to an institution like Mary Sharpe.  Some planters sent their daughters to college to study Latin and Greek as a symbol of a high level of sophistication and class that would elevate their daughter's status in the marriage market. Before the War, high cotton prices meant that college women returned to the plantation for a life of domesticity.   After the Civil War, however, tough economic realties meant that girls like Fannie went to college to prepare themselves to earn a living through teaching or nursing.   Although Fannie may have been an exception, she studied hard to get into college in order to seek her independence from a domestic life on her father's farm.  Contrary to the stereotype of the southern belle, women's higher education in the South developed faster than other regions in the United States during nineteenth century.  By 1860, North Carolina had thirteen female colleges and just six male colleges.  Georgia also had at least ten female colleges.  Academically, female colleges were equivalent to male colleges in math and science with the exception that women studied more classical languages, art and music.  While wealthy families throughout the South sent their daughters  to college as a status symbol, Fannie used the opportunity to become more independent and perhaps challenge male dominated professions.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

His mother discovered this anxiety for books, and tried to encourage it. At length he took resolution to learn the alphabet at all events, and encountering to be among school children, he learned the letters by heart. Soon afterwards, he acquired old parts of spelling books, which he mastered with but little difficulty. His brother, excited by this, tried to learn as well, as well as some friends. George was smarter than his brother, and he became a far better reader than he; every Sunday during the year, he would go off by himself and would stammer over the dim syllables in his spelling book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of another. He would scarcely spare the time to return to ordinary meals, being so engaged with the book. Absorbed in his book at night, his face was in a constant state of perspiration, as he had to sit, sweating and smoking, over a bark or brush light, almost exhausted by the heat of the fire and almost suffocated with smoke. Every Monday morning he looked forward with joy to the next Sunday, that he might again go the shade in the woods and learn letters. He forsook playing and soon learned things from hymns, to songs, to pieces of poetry.","History suggests that most white southerners were afraid of educated slaves because they might encourage rebellion; they could print inciting literature, pass notes from plantation to plantation, or take inspiration from reading abolitionist literature. However, George Horton is one of many slaves reported by historian Janet Cornelius to have learned to read. According to her, anti-literacy laws were rarely enforced, and most white Southern slaves were indifferent to the issue of slave literacy. In fact, by permitting slaves to read the Bible and thus providing them a path to salvation, many slave owners may have assuaged their consciences about the harsh ways in which they treated their human properties. Reading and education helped make the slaves feel less like property and more like a human being, and it was the one thing that George could look forward to throughout the week: the chance to sit and learn to read."],"display_date":1815,"search_date":"1815-07-02","locations":[{"id":9326,"lat":35.6998667026,"lng":-79.2543203263,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2632,"title":"Beginnings of Pharmacology \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-08-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Medical care in major cities such as New York and Philadelphia was far more advanced due to increased access to education and technology; however, this was not true for many rural areas of the country. During the antebellum period, the practices of medical doctors were not always well regulated. Doctors were considered quite knowledgeable but most of their remedies were local in nature and chosen over pharmaceuticals. Steven Stowe, author of Doctoring the South, portrays southern medicine as a mixture of medical school background, country or conventional orthodoxy, personal experience, and even folk cures. The Encyclopedia of the Antebellum South reports that the medicines often prescribed were just as likely to kill as they were to cure the patient; they were often ineffective and allowed the illness to progress for too long before alternative procedures were started. Therefore, much of the development of medicines were not in a lab at a medical school, but rather by the trial and error of educated men on their own time."," Authenticity was a concern for newly developed medicines. Druggists and all other dealers of medications were allowed to sell Cephalic Pills but only the genuine product has the signature of its creator. Not only was the authenticity of the drug an issue, but also the advertisement's claims as to its effects. An ad in the Richmond Daily Examiner in August of 1861 promoted cephalic pills to cure sick headache, nervous headache- even all kinds of headache They are made entirely of vegetable extracts and the ad claims these pills to be the result of much research and experimentation. This ad, like many others of its kind, primarily targeted literary men, students, delicate females, and all persons of sedimentary habits. These pills were said to double as a laxative, restoring the natural elasticity and strength of the whole system. "," The scientific basis for the development of these pills was not yet advanced. Pharmacology in general was still in the early stages of development. Pills were considered more proper than potions, for relief of the head because they remained in the stomach longer before they were able to dissolve. They are also not considered weak or strong and therefore are very agreeable to the digestive system. The basic fundamentals of chemistry were not even solid at this point. It was not until 1897 that JJ Thomson discovered the subatomic particle known as an electron Medicine had just now begun to evolve towards more modern and scientifically based techniques."," The second half of the nineteenth century was a groundbreaking time for biomedical science. The development of germ theory and establishment of fields such as pharmacology paved the way for significant advances in medicine and pharmacology. There was no laboratory instruction for students of pharmacology before the Civil War, and it was not until some pharmacy schools became state supported in the 1860s, that science held an integral role in pharmacology.

Boynton in a hot air balloon above the clouds. The bride was an orphan, born in Northampton County, Virginia, and adopted by Mrs. J.L. West of St. Louis as an infant. With over 6,000 spectators present, the bridal party left the Fifth Avenue Hotel for Central Park. His sister and the owner of the balloon accompanied the young bride and her fiance for the ceremony. They floated away from the Park, exchanging vows and signing the marriage contract while ballooning through the sky. Such a fairy tale wedding made reality for a young girl who once had no hopes for such a comfortable future. Social status was determined in large part by family and as an orphan she was left in the cold. She had little hope for education, medical care, and would have most likely been forced to work in a factory to support herself even as a teen. She was so lucky to avoid all of that. ","During the years preceding the war, slavery continued to fade away and forced by low profitability of small scale farming, many men were forced to find other means of work. Often these farmers could not produce enough substantial crops to feed their families, much less enough to commercially sell at market. Livestock also required larger treks of land to sustain profitability. Fishing and hunting were often alternate ways that the poor obtained food. Economic expansion created a great struggle between the classes. As lumbering, steel, and iron industries emerged, employers began to look past racial lines, hiring whites and blacks as equals. Many men who saw their skin color as the only valuable asset they possessed were stripped of their pride when forced to work side by side with newly freed African Americans. ","Occupation, residence, religious affiliation, and such too often determined much of one's societal value. The poor worked for minimal wages while the socially elite could afford luxuries such as Mary West's wedding dress made of the richest of poplin, trimmed with rich velvet, with a silk hat and gloves to match. Wealthy southern aristocracy shared many of the same privileges as those of the north, but often gaining their wealth by use of slaves. Many owned plantations, but other chose to invest in industrial endeavors. The Duke and Winston families prospered from the tobacco market in North Carolina and Mary Ann Todd, wife of Abraham Lincoln was from a Kentucky family that made its money from banking. Southern wealth was no longer the result of solely slave labor.","Mary West's marriage to Dr. John Boynton was certainly one of exceptional status. They were both highly educated. She attended Monticello Seminary in Illinois and was quite talented in music and drawing. John graduated from a medical institution and was well known for his lectures in geology. He also at one time held government office. Their wedding was elegant and very original even by today's standards. Her dress was rose in color and the hot air balloon was adorned with lace curtains and tassels in the colors of the American flag. After landing at sunset, they took a train back to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to share their first night as husband and wife. Mary West was fortunately raised by a loving mother that was more than able to give her all the comforts that she would have never experienced as an orphan on the eastern shore of Virginia. While Mary West's economic prosperity did not make her happiness, it was far more promising than the life that she was born into.

Copying poetry was a common part of education in the early nineteenth century. This practice would have taught not only poetry, but also handwriting and Greek mythology. Philip was one of John Ambler's sons; his education was a private education in which a tutor came to their house to educate the Ambler children in terms of classic literature, arithmetic, etiquette, and other matters necessary to grow up and succeed in the planter class of the nineteenth century South. "," Private education, like in the Ambler household, succeeded in the South because many of the farms were spread out, making public schooling a difficult concept. Small planters could not afford to have their children educated. On the other hand, wealthy planters wanted their children to be educated so that they understood culture and could hold an educated conversation in social situations; some planters aspired for their sons to become great lawyers and politicians. Tutors were oftentimes aspiring clergymen who had recently graduated from college. They taught Greek, Latin, mathematics, some history, and occasionally foreign languages. The poem Ode to Spring would have been a good teaching method in this realm because it uses allusions to Greek mythology and Italian Renaissance art; the second line refers to the muses, the seventh line alludes to Titian, and the Liquor of Bacchus is mentioned in the twelfth line. The allusions taught history and mythology while the poem itself would have taught literature, and copying the poem would have reinforced handwriting skills. "," In the planter class of the Antebellum South, plantation owners would hire out tutors for either their own children, or even for their children and the children of surrounding plantations. Education was highly valued in their culture because it showed a hierarchical system by reinforcing that education was for the wealthy and free, while the uneducated were often slaves or those too poor to afford the time or money to get an education.

Upon reaching Georgia, the men stopped to visit Atlanta University, an African American university of the state. Their tour of the university led them to observe that the rooms at the school were light, clean,... and cheerful, and that the work of the students at the school was done exceedingly well. After making such observations, they researched the reports made by the Georgia State Board of Examiners about Atlanta University. The Board found that the school created capable students who were equal in their maturity of thought and... ease of expression to students from white universities. The travelers also asked one of the professors if he perceived a difference in learning ability of black students based on the darkness of a student's skin color. The professor told the men that he felt no difference existed. Overall, the men felt that the state of Georgia was making improvements in providing a better education system for black students and decreasing discrimination toward African Americans. ","As outsiders observing Georgia's society, the two men visiting the area made judgments on the African American education system and noted how whites and blacks made judgments about each other. African Americans proved that they were capable of creating a successful educational environment and creating successful students. The research of historian James M. McPherson shows that education in the South during this time period was not up to desired national standards for whites or blacks because of the huge numbers of all southerners not receiving any education. McPherson also noted that because schools were segregated, it was difficult for African Americans to receive an equal education that students received at white universities. The state was forced to try to create equal education standards because separate equality was demanded by law. The Georgia State Board of Examiners may have declared that the school was able to produce black students of equal learning ability in order to avoid punishments from the federal government if they had provided unequal educational opportunities. Since the white men who were outsiders to the area made a judgment similar to the State Board of Examiners, however, there was probably truth to the statement. Although the travelers were impressed with the ability of white men to admit to the equality of black students, the white men were more likely to be concerned with repercussions from the federal government than improved conditions for African Americans."],"display_date":1884,"search_date":"1884-07-01","locations":[{"id":1822,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2683,"title":"The Birth of the Petersburg Benevolent Mechanics Association\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1825-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A cold January day in 1825, 32 Petersburg men gathered in a Petersburg Tavern with the future on their minds.

Mr. Thomas Brown had 945 dollars worth of property, so he paid thirteen dollars in state tax, 3.97 dollars in state school tax, and 5.83 dollars in road tax. The government collected these taxes to pay for education, improvements in the town, and other public expenditures. Even with these taxes, Virginia was deeply in debt.

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2731,"title":"The Advancement of Medicine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-01","end_date":"1892-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" On November 3, 1896, the American Journal of Obstetrics recounted a terrifying story from 1888 in Rockingham, Virginia.

At the home church of George Washington, Mr. Slaughter spoke of the greatness of the Christianity in the life of George Washington and how he was brought up with this faith that led him to lead the country so well and as such a beloved leader. As a Christian, His first wish...is to see the whole world at peace and its inhabitants one band of brothers..."," This speech inspired the ladies of the church to remember how important their faith was to the success of the United States, even one hundred years after its founding. They were reminded once again it was important for them to continue to teach their faith to their family and children as well as to other family members. Not only were all these women convinced to teach their faith to those close to them such as their families, but speeches like this also inspired them to be evangelistic in their communities and to set standards of respectability for all those who observed their actions."," One of the parts of southern society was to identify what social status a person belonged to. Donald G. Mathew writes that in order to define their social status, people would participate in things such as religious gatherings. The church in this time period was a place of worship as well as a place to display the status of your family. This type of meeting was important for women, who were the majority of church members then, not only because it showed their status and wealth in society but also because they were provided an opportunity for education. Therefore, this religious meeting doubled as a meeting which created a sentiment of importance and legitimacy among the women."],"display_date":"May 30, 1886","search_date":"1886-05-30","locations":[{"id":13799,"lat":38.8383886986,"lng":-77.2747207757,"zoom":9,"place":"FAIRFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2733,"title":"Equal Educations?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-05-27","end_date":"1887-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Mr. Mathews opened the letter.

Mr. Mathews felt proud that his son was getting such a good education, and that his family was able to provide this opportunity to both of their sons.

He reminisced about having them around for their help around the home, and he longed for news from his sons since they mostly wrote home to their mother of the news at school including things like their activities, sports, and travels. He occasionally received a letter keeping him updated on their success in school, but he did not often get the news his wife did such as the girls the boys were interested in, or gossip they delivered like the one time Mason, one of his sons, wrote about the locals harassing the blacks in the area who were not permitted to attend the academy.","    Black education had greatly advanced since before the civil war when many whites were still opposed to it. Equality in terms of the education of blacks and whites was still nonexistent. For example, in this case, blacks would not have been allowed to attend the same schools that the Mathews boys were attending. Also, the blacks did not receive an education that was comparable to what the Mathews boys received in terms of learning things like Latin and French. Instead they got a very rudimentary education and, on top of that, Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen point out that there was a shortage of money available in the South to educate the black youth.

Everyone in the community was affected by Mr. S.M. Janney's death. The people, black and white, gathered together to mourn the loss of a dear friend. Even at the old age of 79, Janney was still known to travel all over to preach at different places where all kinds of people would gather to listen to him.

Cooper points out that the morality of Jim Crow laws were never questioned and that there was a religious revival in the South as well as a surge of growth among Christian sects. It was common for these groups to gather according to their economic status as well as their set of beliefs.

Before his move to Alabama, Walton aided African Americans in Southern Missouri and hoped to soon retire from his missionary work.  However, Walton attended the Quaker Illinois Yearly Meeting, which inspired him to resume his responsibilities as a teacher of underprivileged African American children.  Walton stated that he heard both the African Americans and his Heavenly Father calling him to assist the destitute.  Walton organized two First-Day Schools in Stevenson without public school funds.  He repaired the schoolhouse, provided new books for the pupils, and personally paid for many of the students' tuition fees.  Walton temporarily refused a salary in order to lighten the financial burden of the African American families.  Walton personally financed the education of orphans and the children of indigent parents who were unable to work because of sickness.  On November 17, Walton wrote a letter to the Quaker journal, the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em>, requesting aid for his school, asking for donations of Bibles or Testaments, juvenile reading books, First-Day school books, tracts, and papers.  ","Walton emphasized the religious aspect of his work with African Americans, underscoring the belief that God called him to help the mentally, religiously, and financially impoverished children of Stevenson.  In his letter to the<em> Friends' Intelligencer,</em> Walton wrote that his work often caused him mental and physical hardship, arguing that hardship was necessary for fostering spiritual growth.  Walton also implored the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em> readership to sacrifice for the sake of others, saying that religious work should not be confined to those with great ministerial gifts, but should be employed by all Christians.","Walton's sacrifice for the African American community in Stevenson, Alabama supports historian Edward Ayers' argument that those who took Christianity seriously recognized equality among believers and often developed a feeling of fellowship and tolerance towards others.  As Ayers argues that some people within churches tried to reach across racial divides, Walton broke through those divides by teaching the needy children of Alabama. Walton felt great tolerance and even love for his schoolchildren, as he perceived his work as a call from God to help the children plagued by injustice.  In addition, Walton's experience fulfills what historian Robert Handy calls the most significant development in evangelical volunteerism in the post-Civil War era: the growth of Sunday school work lead by lay teachers.  Walton's principal distinction was his expansion of this pattern of Sunday school teaching to African American children in Alabama.

When Austin moved into an African American neighborhood, the white community in Knoxville ostracized her for her work and the area in which she lived. While the community did not object to educating African Americans, they believed that only a very destitute and lowly woman would fraternize with blacks. Initially, Austin worked under the Freedman's Bureau, but when the Bureau was dissolved, she financed the school with personal funds and donations from northern friends. When the school became overcrowded, she erected a large schoolhouse, which she donated to the city, requiring that it always be used to educate African American students. In 1881, Austin grew to believe that she needed to reform her curriculum, as she believed that teaching the arts and sciences left the black students idle, thriftless, and contemptuous of work. Thus, Austin began to declare that industrial training was the only practical education for African Americans, because African Americans could only find employment in the industrial sector. She established industrial training for her students in the departments of sewing, gardening, domestics, and carpentry, but she faced much opposition from the students' parents. The African American parents opposed their children studying different subjects than white children. Austin continued to teach the industrial classes, but split the school day into sections of traditional teachings and industrial teachings.","Austin faced much difficulty in her profession, as both whites and blacks snubbed her for work. Austin said that her greatest difficulty was the African American opposition to her work, but she continued to educate her students because of her strong belief in the importance of industrial education for African Americans. Austin argued that African Americans held a great disadvantage in professional studies, making it impossible for them to compete with white students and gain professional positions. She also argued that education in the arts and sciences lead black students to despise manual labor. Thus, she argued that African Americans needed industrial training to convince them that good, honest work was the only way to make them good citizens. ","Historian Edward Ayers argues that the majority of educated African Americans in the South were limited to employment in manual labor because of their skin color. Ayers states that many educated African Americans despised manual labor, as they believed they were wasting their education if they accepted such work. This hatred explains Austin's belief that educated African Americans had grown to despise the only kind of labor they could acquire, leading her to assert the necessity of African American industrial teaching."],"display_date":"1881 - 1883","search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":12158,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2764,"title":"Durham Handbook Reveals Thoughts on Local African Americans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"1896-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Educator Company, comprised of a group of people dedicated to the advancement and prosperity of their towns, released a Handbook of Durham County in 1895. In the introduction, the authors stated that their intention was to give people seeking a new home a brief description of the area and the advantages it offers as one of the foremost cities of the South. Throughout the book, they gave detailed accounts of various aspects of the county, including its public and private facilities, advantages and needs, and its relation to the state as a larger whole in terms of its products, climate, government, and people. "," When the handbook begins discussing the people of Durham, it mentions the negro population, and states that it was largely descended from former slaves, but the importation of those forced laborers was very rare at the beginning of the 18th century onwards. The authors then attributed the large number of blacks in the area to natural causes such as a healthy climate, a humane public system, and the kindly tempers of the owner They stated that African Americans were happy to stay within the state because of the affection shown to them by their previous masters. Since slaves' emancipation, the book claimed African Americans have been shown absolute equal rights, with the exception of the slightly larger poll-tax and property tax, which the writers attributed to their population within the state, not their particular race. When discussing suffrage later in the hand-book, the authors explained why African Americans are withheld from administering to the law themselves as magistrates. It is because, explained the authors, blacks have just been released from slavery and are therefore ignorant of the duties of citizenship. This, the authors claimed, is for everyone's safety, including the colored man. "," This extract is a commentary on the county of Durham that reveals a great deal about their identity. The Educator Company explains current race relations and demographics with a history of the treatment of African Americans, and claims that Durham is a harmonious community now because it has always been so, even in the times of slavery. This belief, as well as the reasoning behind the disenfranchisement of African American's rights, is representative of many other counties' and states' racial ideologies in the South at the turn of the 19th century. "," At this point in time, several southern states were passing laws or constitutional amendments depriving black citizens of their right to vote, or at least making it very difficult to do so. Jim Crow laws were also very popular, and North Carolina was on the brink of adopting the separate but equal statute following the Plessy v. Ferguson trial. Finally, a ruthless white-supremacy campaign launched in 1898 completed a decade of setbacks for African Americans living in North Carolina. This second-class citizenship was adopted by local, state, and national legislatures, and indeed, the vast majority of Americans. However, despite these obstacles, the black community still focused on improving their condition and bettering their community. Contrasting to the Educator Company's opinion of the political ignorance of African Americans, many of them became involved with and supported the newly formed Fusion political party, a combination of Populists and Republicans."],"display_date":"1895 - 1896","search_date":"1896-01-01","locations":[{"id":9427,"lat":36.0420245844,"lng":-78.889350822,"zoom":10,"place":"DURHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2773,"title":"First Annual Report Issued on the State Industrial and Normal School for Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-12-20","end_date":"1892-12-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School for Women in Greensboro, N.C. had been open for four months when President Charles D. McIvers wrote the college's first annual report to the Board of Directors on December 20, 1892. In this document, he discussed the institution's goals, claiming that the main objective was to prepare women for positions in the house, business office, and most importantly, the school room. McIvers then commented on various aspects of the institution, writing about how pleased he was with the multiple economic demographics represented in the first class. He also explained his philosophies on discipline and administration, believing that the female students should be treated as a self-governing body and made responsible for maintaining and upholding various rules such as curfew and study hours. He believed it had been working very well, and was delighted with the outcome. McIvers then discussed the role of religion in the institution, and mentioned that several women have organized a Young Women's Christian Association, and others attend a Bible class once a week. He ended the letter listing various items that the college needed, and suggested that he and the Board of Directors make an appeal to the General Assembly to help finance these objects. ","Charles McIver was part of a large educational reform movement that began in the 1880's when he and his college friends Edwin Alderman and James Yadkin united in their efforts to lead region-wide school reform. As they campaigned for improvements in the quality and number of schools in North Carolina, they also pushed heavily for the establishment of higher educational institutions for women. In 1891, McIver and his supporters joined forces with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and a smaller group called the King's Daughters to crusade for a vocational school for white women. It was a success, and the State Normal and Industrial School was built in 1892. Many women who composed the first class of 223 students the first year the institution opened had little economic means, and 25 percent of them were orphans or daughters of widows who were pursuing jobs in order to support themselves or those closest to them.

He argued that instead of sending their daughters to large overgrown establishment outside of Athens, they should take advantage of the good teachers and schools available closer to home.  There are two advantages that this Old Citizen found in using the schools closer to home: it would keep the daughters at home and it would keep the money spent on education in the local economy.  ","The Old Citizen firmly believed that daughters should receive an education, just through different means than were popular at the time. Though his editorial implies that educating one's daughters was a common thing to do, he was writing to a specific audience who could afford to send their children away for private schooling. Though there was a push for the establishment of public education earlier, it would be six years before Georgia established a successful public schooling system.  Before 1858 almost all primary and secondary education took place in private schools or from private teachers.  The ability to pay for private teachers was limited to the upper classes, but sending children to boarding schools caused an additional burden because it prevented them from helping at home.","The advantage of keeping daughters at home is likely related to the important housework women performed.  In her book The Politics of Education in the New South, Rebecca Montgomery suggests a parallel between the position of women and the position of slaves in antebellum society.  She explains that legally both slaves and women were dependent on the patriarch.  In addition she draws parallels between the functions of the two groups.  While slaves did the hard labor in the fields, the women did the domestic work.  The importance of the woman's role in the house may have prevented people from wanting to send daughters away to school where they could not help at home and would not learn the domestic skills they would be expected to perform when they got married.  In addition the Old Citizen may have believed it better to keep daughters at home so that their morals could be guarded.  The patriarchal system centered in the home was the primary source of discipline and moral values in the antebellum South. ","This editorial also reflected on the economy of private education.  The Old Citizen wanted people to school their daughters in Athens so that the money they paid went back into the Athens economy.  This implies that there was an awareness of the value of the local economy in the antebellum South.  Though transportation systems were rapidly developing in the antebellum period, there was still a sense that keeping money at home, in the local economy, was a way to benefit one's community.  This was especially true in a developed urban area like Athens, which by the time of this editorial had been established for 67 years.  The city in 1852 had much to offer its citizens, largely due to its extensive manufacturing system."],"display_date":"January 8, 1852","search_date":"1852-01-08","locations":[{"id":1656,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2804,"title":"Family Influence on Religious Choices\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-05-01","end_date":"1839-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Walker I. Brookes wrote a letter to his father, Iveson Brookes, from his school in Penfield, Georgia in 1839.  Walker was most likely a student of the relatively new Baptist institution, Mercer University. In his letter, he told his father of the large number of baptisms that had taken place recently. He reported that 13 boys at Mercer and 24 girls at the Penfield Female Academy, which was organized by the Mercer administration, had been baptized. Walker's reason to write this letter, though, was not to report these events but to ask his father for permission to be baptized himself. Iveson Brookes was a Baptist minister so Walker probably had little doubt that his father would approve of his baptism. Yet he still felt it was his duty, as he says, to formally consult with his father beforehand. Walker told his father when he wrote, I gave in my experience before the Church and they say that they were altogether satisfied with it. He was ready to go through with this religious ritual as soon as he got the approval of his father.  ","Mercer University was part of a wave of denominational colleges founded in the South during the nineteenth century. Founded in 1833 with the name Mercer Institute, by the Georgia Baptist Convention, the college, like most Baptist colleges of the period, was located in a rural area of Georgia.  The founding of the college also marked the founding of Penfield, the newly formed town where it was located.  Denominational colleges like Mercer were founded by Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists throughout the South and by the 1850's dominated higher education in the region.","Though looking back these colleges are often looked down upon as being conservative and overly traditional, at the time they were pushing the boundaries of education.  When compared to contemporary state universities, the curricula of denominational colleges differed greatly and in many ways more closely resembled modern liberal arts curricula.  State colleges in the mid- nineteenth century were focusing on practical education to improve technology and science. The schools founded by evangelicals, on the other hand, studied a greater amount of classical languages, literature, and religion in addition to participating in useful activities like farming.  The religious organizations began to found these educational institutions both because of an ideological belief in education, and for the practical reason of increasing clergy and training future religious leaders. Despite their strong sectarian foundations, the students of these institutions were often more diverse because they would pull from the local community regardless of religion. Relative to state universities, the denominational colleges were inexpensive and less elitist, often drawing students from the middle classes. ","Along with providing a less aristocratic and expensive college choice, denominational colleges appealed to parents by presenting themselves as providing strong morals for their students. In this letter, though, we can see that the family still held the most power in moral and religious decisions.  Even if the school or the school community encouraged students to be baptized, the family was the final decision maker."],"display_date":"May 1, 1839 - May 30, 1839","search_date":"1839-05-15","locations":[{"id":1850,"lat":33.5789538766,"lng":-83.1662400397,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2822,"title":"The Value of the Extended Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-10-21","end_date":"1838-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1838 Iveson Lewis Brookes received a letter from his cousin, P.B. (signed with only initials) informing him that his nephew, P.B.'s son, might be moving to Augusta, Georgia for a job. Augusta was near the plantation Iveson was managing for his son in Jasper and Jones counties.  We can tell from the letter that Iveson and P.B. were not particularly involved in each others' lives because P.B. took much of the letter to update Iveson about events in his family over the past few years. Despite this relatively weak relationship between the cousins, P.B. asked Iveson, would you act the part of a Father in watching over his morals. To P.B. extended family would be an important source of security for his son if he chose to move far away from his parents. ","This instance in the life of the Brookes shows that the family, and more specifically male patriarchs, was responsible for inculcating moral values. In addition, for Iveson to play the part of the father he would make sure that his nephew was kept in line and disciplined.  At other times and places different people and institutions held the important responsibility of keeping watch over the discipline and moral education. At this moment in the South, this responsibility was undergoing a shift from the church back toward the family.  Church records reflect that over the course of the 1830's churches were beginning to give up power to the family. They shifted pew organization from gender-segregated to family-friendly and reduced the amount that they disciplined their members.","In their book Paternalism in a Southern City, Edward Cashin and Glenn Eskew show how patriarchal power relates to and results from the plantation system and the Great Awakening. They argued that even outside of plantations themselves, southern society was based on the plantation system.  In this system it was the patriarch who was in control.  The plantation system allowed the man to stay at the house as a controlling figure. During this period in the North women were often left to manage the house while their husbands were at work.  In the North in the 1830's, it was the woman who became the source of moral wisdom in the family."],"display_date":"October 21, 1838","search_date":"1838-10-21","locations":[{"id":1944,"lat":33.3199345603,"lng":-83.6889280155,"zoom":10,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2828,"title":"North Carolinians Strive for Free Public Schools\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-12-26","end_date":"1873-12-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The North Carolina legislature took a step in the right direction by proposing a bill to authorize cities and towns with more than 2,000 inhabitants to establish and maintain public schools. Authorities of these towns could at anytime decide whether or not free public schools shall be established. Raleigh citizens voiced their overwhelming approval for this bill during a town meeting. The public school system would be supported by taxation since this was the only way to insure its success. ","The measure proposed in Raleigh is only a small step in the right direction. The South must persist in its endeavor, as the New York Times would argue, by establishing a system of public schools in all the States. In some states, the proportion of illiterates to literates in the population is alarming. Through the establishment of free public schools, the South can fulfill its chief need: education.","There were many reasons for the lack of schooling in the South. Neither the wealthy planters nor the poor farmers pressured the Southern legislatures to spend money on education. Neither group saw much benefit in public education for themselves or their children. Certain Southern whites disliked the idea of educating blacks because they feared that such education might threaten white supremacy. Though they rendered perfunctory tribute to public education in their messages to the legislature, as historian Albert Ray Newsome observes, the governors were in most cases indifferent to education. However, other Southerners recognized that the education of freedom was necessary to prepare citizens for the responsibilities of freedom.

While there had been an educational revival after the Civil War, public education was still defined by the typical one-room schoolhouse, taught by a young woman with children whose ages ranged from 6 years to 16 years. Teaching was not an ideal job; it was very difficult. Even with the difficulties, many Southern women were schoolteachers. These jobs gave women some independence in a primarily male-dominated world. "," In 1886, a young woman named G. E. Thomas agreed to teach in the Flood school-house for 35 dollars per month, which was just above the national average of 34.27. Her responsibilities included the upkeep of a school register and keeping the school room neat with the floor swept. She had to open school at 9 AM and had to give the children a one 1 hour break for lunch. School was over at 3:30. She was subject to a fine if she did not complete her duties, and she was required to attend a monthly meeting of teachers. While this was clearly a difficult job, G.E. Thomas signed the contract along with Mercer H. Gray, the chairman of the board. ","   Women throughout the South were often forced to work due to economic necessity. Teaching was the most common job that was socially acceptable for young women. Teaching was acceptable because it was an extension of a woman's role to nurture and care for the next generation. Women chose teaching in order to be economically self-sufficient. If a young woman was a spinster, teaching allowed her to help provide for her family and not to be an economic burden. It is unclear why G.E. Thomas decided to teach. She may have been unmarried and therefore needed the job to support herself since, without a husband, she was in a fragile position in Southern society. Regardless or her marital status, it was evident that she needed this job. Her school was for white children, as education was segregated at the time. Therefore, however small her school house may have been, her supplies and equipment were superior to any black school. Through teaching, women were able to contribute to the public sphere and gain some independence in a world where she was expected to be dependent on her family. Teaching was possible for many women because of the increasing standards of education throughout the United States. Especially in an increasingly industrialized society, education was important.

According to the Clarion Ledger Jackson had been selected as the site of the Mary Holmes school for the colored people, despite protests of many newspapers and citizens. They did not, however, formally attempt to stop the project, as it was, according to Samuel Rogal's account of Holmes' educational ministry, a only seminary founded by a white woman working with a white staff and a white faculty to educate young Black girls in the domestic arts. Thus, a service to consecrate the twenty acres of ground acquired for the seminary occurred at Jackson, Mississippi, on 24 December 1891 with no protest from the locals. The school officially opened on September 28, 1892, and was dedicated to Mary Emilie Holmes's mother on October 12 of that same year.","At first glance, establishing such a school seems to be an incredible achievement. Mary Holmes, who was trained first at Rockford Female Seminary and later at the University of Michigan and was the first woman to receive a doctorate in the earth sciences, had succeeded in establishing a school for black young women in the heart of the Deep South. After benefiting Swift Memorial College in Rogersville, Tennessee and Monticello Academy in southeastern Arkansas, despite resistance from white communities in the areas (especially in Tennessee), Holmes's commitment and mission to the education of black children, principally females, which she saw fit to channel through the missionary arms and agencies of the Presbyterian Church, had paid off for a third time. Not only that, but within only twenty-six months, Holmes and her father had enlisted the direct assistance of the Board of Missions for Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.; of local Home Missionary societies; of the Woman's Board of Home Missions in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and New York; of the Balck communities of Jackson; and of individual families in Rockford. It is no small wonder that whites in Jackson were not outraged at such an institution.","The reason for this, however, is that perhaps Mary Holmes's school was not such an achievement after all, as the curriculum emphasized courses of instruction in sewing, mending, cooking, laundry, and general housekeeping, almost [guaranteeing] that her charges would never rise beyond the various states of domestic service. Furthermore, it seems that Mary Emily [sic] Holmes...simply avoids the issue of racial segregation in the Deep South. She accepts it (although perhaps not agreeing with it) as a fact of life and goes about her business. Therefore, because she was not directly challenging the status quo, the whites of Jackson (and later West Point after the original establishment burned down in 1895) tolerated the existence of a school educating young black women.","Yet, Mary Holmes was indeed a pioneer and did in a way challenge the status quo. Mary Emily [sic] Holmes... stood above (or at least beyond) her generation of American educators by promoting the notion that education would certainly prove beneficial to every American Youngster, no matter what his or her social, economic, or racial classification. With this motivation, she attempted to teach young women something, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, that would lift them from the moral, mental, physical, and spiritual degradation which had been the background of the race for 250 years; through her Presbyterian missions and schools, she gave black women a reason to hope for something beyond the racial boundaries set for them by society, which was especially important in Mississippi. In this way, she attempted to fulfill in them her motto and her educational-evangelical mission: Not to seem, but to be."],"display_date":"November - December 1891","search_date":"1891-11-30","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2896,"title":"A Different Type of Honor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["University honor systems meant something very different in nineteenth century South from what they do in the twenty-first century. The Honor Systems essentially were guides on how to be a Southern Gentlemen. The University of Virginia's Honor Code, which in the twentieth century the university defined as only outlawing lying, cheating, and stealing, included rules against spitting in public and other such guidelines. These rules theoretically helped the school produce good Southern gentlemen. Washington College's honor system originated from General Robert E. Lee, a former president of the University, who said, We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman. ","In a letter to his aunt Elizabeth Ann Willson of Fairfield, Virginia, William M. Willson admitted to having troubles at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University of Lexington, Virginia). His family was not particularly wealthy, and he recognized how his father sacrificed in order to fund his education. However, Willson felt that he was completely justified in his affairs. Two of his schoolmates, his friends, were found to be drinking in their dormitories. The faculty, led by two professors in particular, subsequently expelled them from the University. Most of the student body challenged the faculty, feeling that the punishment was too harsh and that the two faculty members were acting on political motives. Suddenly, the school was divided between the faculty and the majority of its students, both sides too proud to back down. Was the university's honor code itself the cause of the open rebellion? The young men, as gentlemen, could not admit defeat; they had decided to stand by the two wronged students. Willson told his aunt that his father would be disappointed but would understand the need to do this. He assured her that he had not fallen in with a rough crowd and that all the best men were involved. The faculty faced a similar dilemma; they could either let the two students back into the university, thereby keeping all the other students, or the school could lose the majority of its young men. The all-male faculty also felt that they could not back off the issue. In fact, in the letter, Willson believed that he would soon be expelled. He desperately wished he had not been involved, but he knew that now that he was, he had no choice but to deal with the consequences. It was the honorable thing to do.","Both the North and the South displayed this stubbornness in the early days of the Civil War. The fired shot at Fort Sumter drew Lincoln into the war because he had made a threat and he was too honorable to back down. With each step the North made, southerners were faced with their baseless rants that they had made, and in order to be considered gentlemen they had to secede or fight or send their sons to fight.

In speaking to the Calliopean and Polytechnic Societies at the Citadel Academy in Charleston in 1853, Yeadon took the opportunity to address the audience on what would happen if higher institutions in South Carolina did not maintain strict discipline among their pupils.","Stemming from God, Order is the great law of nature, whereas Insubordination or rebellion was the primal sin, which drove [man] from Paradise. In the United States, Yeadon noted, order takes the place of the sword of power, pervading, ruling, and harmonizing our political system, which leads to the people of the United States literally reveling in the enjoyment of a political Eden, a national Paradise. But he cautioned, without order, we would be torn by civil dissensions, beyond all other nations, as the necessary result of our division into separate States...and we would soon behold our great and glorious Union, now covering a continent with its nationality and with the ample folds of our starry banner, broken into warring fragments, unable to command peace at home or respect abroad, and a derision and a by-word among nations. ","Yeadon's was a timely lesson. In 1853, only 11 students graduated from the College of Columbia, and nary a soul from the Citadel. It is manifest that a spirit of insubordination among our youth is not only at the bottom of these deplorable results, Yeadon concluded, but that it has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. ","There are several reasons he gave for why this spirit of insubordination ought to be diminished, but the last was the most telling: The nature of our institution of domestic slavery, and its exposure of us to hostile machinations, both at home and abroad, render it doubly incumbent on us, and on our whole sisterhood of Southern States, to cherish a military spirit and diffuse military science among our people.... Thus prepared and harnessed for conflict...the South, the united South, self-sustained and self-defended, and thrice armed, as having her quarrel just, may defy the world in arms. ","One can almost hear his voice rising to a crescendo on these last words. Yet it was November 23, 1853. War would not break out between the states for over seven more years. But one would think from listening to Richard Yeadon's speech that the armies were marching to Charleston that instant. And the main reason for preserving order in the South's colleges: the threat of external attack on the South's peculiar institution. ","This episode supports historian Arthur Cole and others who believe there existed in South Carolina in the 1850s the danger of a rupture of the Union and of civil war ten years before the firing of the first gun on Fort Sumter when even sober-minded southerners...began to calculate the value of the Union.

Sass addressed the changing times as he discussed how a person is unable to choose whether an act reflects character or was the result of one's circumstances. He stressed unity in the future as his class matured and entered the world; he stressed unity as he said, And so we forgive and forget, and get along as well as we can with our neighbors, without going too far into the problem of their hidden characters. It is the wisest policy of all. Through this ignorance of surroundings, according to Sass, the class had to realize its powerless nature in regards to circumstance. As his speech progressed, Sass concentrated on the class? future by saying, ?it is not through the cultivation of the spirit of revolt and iconoclasm that this great end is to be attained. Not the breakers down, but the builders up, are the real helpers of humanity.? ","   In the speech, Sass touches on the concept of revolt in regards to a restoration of the antebellum South; in the post-Reconstruction era of the Jim Crow laws, this address incorporates a unique concept toward the increasing lines of binary division between the black and white races. According to Janette Thomas Greenwood, the 1890s set the stage for a white supremacist uprising in the South as concepts like Social Darwinism supported the biological superiority of the whites over the blacks as a whole. Sass? address stresses the importance of aid to humanity as a whole rather than revolt and negativity. Though he does not directly address the concept of racial superiority, he stresses both the focus of being a positive influence on humanity and the negativity of revolt, which directly relates to the deconstruction caused by the violence of white supremacists. ","   White supremacist groups, like the Ku Klux Klan, had used terrorist tactics in influencing the politically active blacks since 1866 across the South; moreover, the speech reflects the Southern tendency toward violence. Edward Ayers discusses how the time, being filled with political and economic conflict, following the Civil War yielded a volatile situation between the black and white populations.

Such a library could be large-Charlestonians Thomas Smyth and William Gilmore Simms owned 20,000 and 12,000 volumes, respectively, in the 1850s-or much smaller. Regardless, it was important to have the newest book on your shelf, a collection of the classics, or at least a few books relating to one's field of study. ","By March 1854, James Warley Miles had built up such a collection, and the sale of his personal library would certainly have surprised his closest friends. This is especially true since Miles was a well-known figure around Charleston, known for being quite fond of books in general, his books in particular. Indeed, his love of books was enough to cause Francis Lieber in an 1853 letter to George Ticknor to comment, This Rev. Mr. Miles feels very unhappy at Charleston, and all his ardent soul longs for is to have a humble place in some library, for which by the way he would fit most admirably. Miles subsequently held the librarian post at the College of Charleston from 1857 until 1865.","But before this, Miles served as a pastor and as a professor of Ancient Languages at the College of Charleston. A theological liberal and philosophical idealist, religious and linguistic works dominated Miles' library, covering over 30 languages and coming from places as far off as Ghent and Calcutta. A catalogue created for its sale notes works on oriental languages (including Turkish, Sanskrit, Georgian, Persian, and Armenian) and classical literature, as well as works written in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin. For Miles to part with such a collection was personally devastating. The need to raise funds for a trip to Europe (on doctor's orders) to recover his health, though, was more pressing. So on March 8, 1854, the books went on sale. ","Much to Miles' surprise, however, the library was purchased in whole (probably by William Gilmore Simms, himself, though no one was certain). In turn, Miles requested the entire collection be turned over to the College of Charleston. He explained his rationale for doing so in his first report as Librarian in 1857, saying, I do not know better how to respond to the feelings of those who have manifested such noble, generous and appreciative sympathy for the pursuits of a humble student than by endeavoring to extend in the most feasible manner to all students in our community whatever advantages may be derived from the consultation of a collection preserved from dissipation by an act as noble and praiseworthy as it is generous and unusual. ","This episode shows the academic nature of the Southern elite in the mid-1800s. Men (at least those with sufficient means) in Charleston were wont to dabble in a wide variety of endeavors, and there was no better place to start one's journey than to read and create a private library. Miles', in particular, sheds light on the talents of educated men at this time, and the extent to which they were able to cover the world in search of books. Moreover, this episode demonstrates the scholarly nature of Charleston, one of the South's cultural leaders.

It included discussions on nine different disciplines intended to foster learning in the broadest and most holistic sense. At the conclusion of the speech, Russell presented to the assembled body a constitution for their approval. ","Russell's speech was representative of the early republican ideals of America; the continued vitality of the republic was dependant upon an educated populace that yearned to cultivate knowledge, nurture patriotism, and foster virtue.

While in other parts of the country, there was so much heated contention over how the Bible should be taught in public schools that there were violent riots (Philadelphia 1844), Russell's discussions of the different disciplines did not include any form of biblical study. A possible explanation for this is the Deism movement that held influence in American intellectual life and affected many secular movements of the day. The body assembled in 1830 was most interested in the continuation of American patriotism and self-governance.

All the popular political and social issues were discussed, as well as the occasional foray into literature or history. For example, the first six topics in the 1854-1855 season were Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, poetry (written by a Society member), Parish Representation, political representation, Grayson's The Hireling and the Slave, and the destiny of negroes in the South.

The result, on June 2, was the creation of the South Carolina Historical Society and the approval of a constitution drafted by Dr. James Moultrie and Professors W. J. Rivers and F. A. Porcher. In 1856, the state of South Carolina incorporated the Society, and by 1857, the Society had secured the means to publish the first volume of The Collections of the Historical Society of South Carolina. The first volume was innocuous enough, including rather harmless topics like an address to the Society by Professor Porcher, a College of Charleston history professor. Yet by 1859 the conversations had changed drastically. In a May 19 oration to the Society-a speech reprinted in the third volume of the Collections-Second Vice President William Trescot took the opportunity to make a few remarks on the institution of slavery. Trescot's message was in line with most Southern thinkers of the day. Slavery was the great leveler, making a society of equals, by elevating all citizens of the State to the condition of a privileged class. It was an institution that knit together its members in their various conditions into one harmonious whole and made South Carolinians a grave, earnest, resolute, just people. ","This episode is important in highlighting the origins of ideas in the nineteenth century South: ordinary citizens, typical Charleston residents discussing typical Charleston issues among peers. In the words of historian Michael O'Brien, they were an urbane intelligentsia, not a workshop of experts. Their ideas were their own, though those often trickled down through newspapers and day-to-day conversation to ultimately reflect-as Trescot's did-opinions held by society at large. Ideas like his on the justness of slavery ultimately dominated the debates in all the aforementioned societies in Charleston during this time, and succeeded in casting a shadow over subsequent literary discussion."],"display_date":"June 2, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-02","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2918,"title":"A Polite Education\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-09-18","end_date":"1828-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Education for women in the Antebellum South played a key role in defining and regulating social status. Many Southerners did not see education as a way to enlighten women, but rather to refine and polish them, and make them more suitable for marriage. In the Argus newspaper, published in Savannah, Georgia, an advertisement appeared in September of 1828. It announced Mr. Phillips's new school for young ladies, where they will be instructed in every branch of a polite and finished Education. Mr. Phillips's ad attempted to present his school as safe and innocuous. He called the subjects he would be teaching, polite and finished despite the fact that the formidable list of subjects he planned to teach was 11 topics long and included Writing, Astronomy, Rhetoric, and French. This attempt to make the school sound safe made sense given the tenuous position women's education had in the minds of southerners. "," The education of women in the South was both frightening to white men and necessary to the structure of southern society. In the male dominated South, men acted as heads of the household, and relied on domination of their wives and daughters as much as they relied on domination of their slaves to hold their position in society. An educated woman posed a threat to this domination by setting herself on an equal plane with white men. Education, however, also was a hallmark of the middle and upper classes in the South and a southern woman could not hope to be accepted into higher class society without a minimal education. If a woman was educated it meant that her family had had enough labor in the form of slaves or servants so that she did not have to work to help the family but instead could devote her time to studying. This concept of leisure time for women was intricately connected to the concepts of class and education. Mr. Phillips's advertisement perfectly demonstrates these tensions between male dominated society and the preservation of existing class structures by publicizing a school that he presents as both harmless and impressive at the same time. Anything else would have flown in the face of male supremacy or upper class ideals."],"display_date":"September 18, 1828","search_date":"1828-09-18","locations":[{"id":1628,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2944,"title":"They Danced &#39;til Dawn\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-05-26","end_date":"1866-05-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Entertainment was a little-known pursuit in the South in the years during and after the Civil War. However, for those white Southerners who did not lose everything, maintaining some of their old traditions was of the utmost importance. In May 1866, W.D. Cabell of Nelson County, Virginia, wrote to his wife Mary in Philadelphia of a large party which he had recently attended. He tells her that he went with 25 young gentlemen from the school of which he is principal. The party quickly evolved into a dance, which was quite entertaining for the young people. Cabell left the dance at 1 a.m., but it was apparently still going on at that time. He tells his wife that I hear they danced 8 sets after day light by the best music, violins and piano. They are coming in now looking quite broken down. ","Far from adopting the disapproving tone expected of a teacher and authority figure, Cabell seems to take comfort in the young people's revelry. He was known to be a staunch supporter of the Confederacy, and perhaps the dance reminded him of the more carefree antebellum period. ","Virginia, in particular, wished to rebuild and retain its cultural identity after the war. In his dissertation on post-Civil War Virginia, James Douglas Smith writes that In the midst of Reconstruction the need for social diversions was not forgotten...their daily lives were frequently brightened by the famed, but now less expansive, Virginia hospitality. Parties, dances, picnics, tournaments, hunting, fishing, baseball, lectures, plays and tableaux were all popular amusements...In the background, generally avoided, were the men in blue, the Federal occupation forces. In addition to the presence of the Federal troops, Virginians had to deal with loss of property and money, yet even in the face of financial ruin Virginians attempted to maintain a vibrant culture and society. In fact, Smith goes on to write that the fondness of Virginians for visiting relatives and friends, holding parties and dancing all night was only slightly abated by the pecuniary distress of these years."],"display_date":"May 26, 1866","search_date":"1866-05-26","locations":[{"id":14084,"lat":37.7873885597,"lng":-78.8867512571,"zoom":9,"place":"NELSON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2967,"title":"Institutional Inequality\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-07-31","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The July 31, 1899 report by the superintendent of public schools in Norfolk Virginia illustrated the disparity between white and black students in regards to educational opportunity and proficiency. School Superintendent Richard A. Dobie filed the report, at the request of Norfolk Mayor C. Brooks Johnston. Though the Report was not intended to make any political or social gestures, analysis of the data entailed, reveals striking inequalities in the social institutions of Norfolk. While the report does not comment on the subjective quality of education, or provide test scores, the report does provide us with records of student absenteeism, teacher salaries, and school population reports. Most evident from analysis of the data is the striking disparity between teacher salaries. According to the report white men make on average 40.71 more than a black man, similarly, while women make less than men of both white and black racial identity, white women earn on average a salary of 55.43 compared to the salary of a black women 45.00. Consequently, lower wages provided a disincentive for quality black teachers to enter the education field. Additional evidence of what appears to be an emerging preference toward white students is the teacher to student ratio found in many of the Norfolk classrooms. Of the sixty-five teachers employed by the Norfolk school district, only eleven of them were African Americans, leaving classrooms overcrowded. Perhaps what best highlights the overcrowding of black schools was the actual number of students enrolled on average in the various white and black schools of Norfolk. The nine public schools which housed the 3343 white students was sizably less crowded than the two black schools that housed the 829 black students enrolled in public school. Additionally the attendance of black students is on average lower than the attendance of white students in the city of Norfolk. While the average attendance rate at the nine white schools hovered between ninety and ninety-five percent, the two black schools witnessed attendance rates of only eighty percent, including Atlantic City School (colored) that had only fifty-four percent student attendance. The findings of the report illustrate the shift from visible outwardly hostile racism witnessed during the Civil War to the more subtle incorporation of institutional racism. Black disenfranchisement and the disproportionate access to government funding of schools was the driving force behind the educational inequity. The most notable danger of this report is the findings were prefaced with no explanation of the policies or spheres of improvement, indicating that inadequacies of the black schools was not an area of concern.

Conway identified the Northern Peabody Education Fund as the root of many problems public Louisiana schools were facing; in particular, Conway cited the Fund as responsible for having created the growing trend of white parents taking their children out of public schools.  Because the Peabody Fund's money explicitly provided assistance for free schools open to both black and white children, Conway could easily trace his problems back to the Fund's policy.  White parents in Louisiana increasingly refused to send their children to public schools that now allowed black children to attend.  Many white parents would rather remove their children from education altogether, or send them to private schools than have them attend classes with former slaves.  Because so many white parents would not allow their children to learn with African Americans, it seemed that African Americans were receiving a greater proportion of educational funding.  Feeling cheated, whites, with Conway leading them, attacked the Peabody Fund.  "," Therefore in December 1870, Dr. Barnas Sears, the general agent and administrator of the Peabody Fund, wrote a letter in response to Conway's complaints.  <em>The Farmer's Cabinet </em>reported on December 29, 1870 that Sears wrote to Conway: 'We [the Peabody Fund] ourselves raise no question about mixed schools.  We simply take the fact that the white children do not attend them without passing on the propriety or impropriety of their course.  We wish to promote universal education - to the whole community if possible.'  Sears was carrying out the mandate that the Peabody Fund had been established upon, that education for <em>all </em>children was the most essential aspect of trying to rebuild the war-torn South.   "," During Reconstruction in the South, black children were finally allowed to attend public schools.  The new Louisiana constitution, written by both white and black elected delegates, not only outlawed segregation in public schools but also required that every parish establish at least one school within its jurisdiction.  As Tunnell includes in his <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>,  a free African American delegate from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, who helped to write the new constitution, believed that these new provisions for education would elevate and enrich a Louisiana which had previously been ridden with both black and white ignorance and illiteracy.  However, in Louisiana, with a large African American population, this created major problems within the school system.  Since racism still afflicted Louisiana and the greater South, white parents often refused to send their children to school with African American children. The years of Reconstruction saw the rise of a great number of private schools across the South, as whites searched for alternatives to sending their children to school with African American children."," The complex tensions found within Southern society during Reconstruction are clearly shown in education.  The Northern money flowing into the devastated South was both needed and resented.  The disruption of the Southern social order as evidenced in changes within its system of education was a source of great conflict and attention during the Reconstruction era."],"display_date":"December 29, 1870","search_date":"1870-12-29","locations":[{"id":5547,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3022,"title":"Female Education\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-07-06","end_date":"1835-07-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 6, 1835, the <em>Georgia Telegraph</em> published an editorial from the June edition of the <em>Knickerbocker </em>in regards to the brooding controversy about whether or not women should be educated. After heartily endorsing the editorial, the Telegraph ran the entirety of the article.","The <em>Knickerbocker </em> began by reviewing the failure of male education and, thus, the necessity of educating females. Because even schooling had failed to save the male mind from its aggression and sexual deviance, females needed to be educated in order to help lead society. Now, the woman who should be seen rather than heard symbolized an abandonment of useful knowledge and a trifling waste of time. A woman who desired to shine in society and win the hearts and minds of educated men should herself be educated.","According to the editorial, the time for ignoring female intellect had passed. While it wished not to detract from earlier accomplishments, this article pushed on for an exaltation of the female mind. Contrary to popular belief at the time, the scientists behind this editorial knew that the capability of the female mind did not differ in potential from that of the male mind. Despite the subjugation of the female by society, female accomplishments numbered many and this number would grow infinitely if given the proper opportunity. ","The editorial closed by noting that mankind is often copyists of the old world, or simply blind followers of tradition. If the women of the United States were to succeed, they would do through formal education, an increased appreciation of literature, and increased morality, not by remaining within the bounds of society's conventions. The refreshing shower expanding into eloquence and beauty via the cultivation of female intellect became the rallying point for the Knickerbocker, and in turn through their endorsement, the Georgia Telegraph.","For a major newspaper, the Georgia Telegraph was ahead of its time culturally. While colleges and female seminaries called for equity in education for females, society largely constructed a much more traditional standard for women and education. While other newspapers hosted advertisements for women's schooling, most of these schools featured sewing, knitting, child rearing, and housekeeping. In this way, much of southern society demanded the training of ladies, but the <em>Knickerbocker </em>and the Telegraph sought a well-rounded, equally educated woman for a changing antebellum South.","Despite the general sentiment of the population against the education of females, education in the South was actually far less gendered than most realize. As a focus on human rights and evangelical Christianity swept the nation, women's education for the sake of education itself and so that women had the ability to read and understand the Bible for themselves gained increased attention. Despite the focus on the cultivation of the female mind, specific institutions often remained loyal to societal consensus in their academic practices. While schools focused on the educational development of the female mind, they also sought to reinforce cultural expectations of what it meant to be a woman. Housework, child-rearing, and the expectations of life as a southern lady in plantation society remained on the educational docket, even as a focus on the academic lives of women grew."],"display_date":"July 6, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-06","locations":[{"id":1547,"lat":32.8060034472,"lng":-83.7076277097,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3028,"title":"Winthrop Normal College Embraces Education of Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-01-24","end_date":"1894-01-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In <em>The Pickens Sentinel</em>, the final construction of the State Industrial and Winthrop Normal College at Rock Hill is described in a board of trustees meeting.

Subject focuses by which women may be qualified to earn independent support, or to make their homes more comfortable, more economical and more beautiful were also to be major players in a student's life at the college. The board decided to include one year of prepatory study in the curriculum while incorporating the pedagogies, English, the classics, the sciences, industrial arts, the arts and other varying departments. The faculty was to control the institution under a president; professors were to be entrusted with the instruction and control of the several collegiate departments of study and the concept of texts. As an outside body, the board of trustees was to have the ability to appoint instructors, determine terms of office and salaries, and determine meetings for delegation.

Throughout southern history, the women have predominately been domestic characters that were, if educated at all, taught in the home through private tutors. According to Edward Ayers, the bicycle, the right of petition and the push for admission into centers of higher education all show the metamorphosis of the southern white woman into a new woman of independence. In the example of Winthrop Normal College at Rock Hill, women were allowed into a college in order to expand their knowledge; this showed a sense of growth of women's rights in the state. However, according to Elizabeth Colton, Southern women often specialized in the more feminine studies, like art and hospitality, which differentiated the Southern female education experience from many other parts of the country at this time period.

The citizens expressed outrage at the legislation, saying themselves and other citizens were prepared to disobey the law because slaves across Southern plantations already had the ability to read. They further expressed their opinion that the law would not be enforced in the state, except in cases of malicious and spiteful intent on some slaveholders' parts to punish men better than themselves. The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance. They argued that general ignorance within the slave population is more of a threat because it would make slaves much more susceptible to the influences of any Nat Turner type character that might pass through the region. The petition ended with the scornful question does chivalrous South Carolina quail before gangs of cowardly Africans with a Bible in their hands?","    Despite the moral and Christian basis of this petition, this appeal and many others like it were continually rejected by the state legislators. According to historian Walter Edgar, South Carolina was known across the antebellum South as the most stringent state with regards to teaching blacks, both free and enslaved. However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon. This episode is an excellent illustration of the different pressures felt by white Southerners throughout the antebellum period: recognizing slaves as human souls entitled to the same rights as whites versus slaves as commodities upholding the economic and cultural basis of Southern culture."],"display_date":1834,"search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":11463,"lat":34.6920570183,"lng":-81.1595343266,"zoom":10,"place":"CHESTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3069,"title":"Commencement at the College of South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-12-03","end_date":"1816-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Commencement for the Class of 1816 at the College of South Carolina was completed at 10 am on Monday, December 2.

Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable.

The constitution of the society specified intentions to research all foreign and domestic plants and animals, to discover more utilities for all available resources in the region, and to discover the ways in which foreign plants and animals adapt to their new environments when introduced to the region.

Consequentially, it is not surprising that many local organizations such as the one described above were established across South Carolina during the antebellum period. Eventually almost every county across the state had some form of agricultural society.

Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, coming from Kentucky, decided to open an academy for young ladies in Nashville. This Academy was very similar to those built for young Tennessean men even if some subjects were specific to women's instruction. Thus, the married couple taught subjects as significant as the pronunciation of English language, reading, penmanship, arithmetic, English grammar and geography with the use of the globes. The Academy was also organized like other schools: the students paid tuition fees (at first, it was 45 dollars per session but it increased a lot during the following year) and ladies who came from afar were boarded. So, the opening of the Arnolds' school had an impact both on Nashville's population and those of other states. This school was very successful from the beginning and the Arnolds quickly announced the Academy would stay open the following years. Ten years after its establishment, in 1826, it enrolled almost three hundred students whereas the University of Nashville, built for men, rarely had more than 100 students, since most men chose to study in other states. Nashville Female Academy soon became one of the best known schools for girls in the South and was considered as a local pride and an example to follow. When President James Monroe came to Nashville in 1819, he went into the school for an address before students and faculty members who were considered as full-fledged scholars. ","The Nashville Academy was created at a time when other institutions were admitting only men and tended to be religious. It was a really quaint institution, even if academies for ladies soon started to flourish elsewhere in the South. Education was by no means confined to the East and the North. Female education received a special attention in Tennessee which was, as far as women education is concerned, a pioneer state. For example, The Fisk Female Academy, created in Overton County in 1806 is considered as the first academy for girls in the South. Other schools for girls followed in the Volunteer State: in Knoxville, Memphis, Gallatin, Rogersville, Murfreesboro, McMinnville, Paris,and Lebanon for example. These schools were a part of the social and economic transition in Tennessee after the war of 1812. Indeed, this war, fought between the United States and Great Britain from June 1812 to the spring of 1815, had a big impact on Tennessee (the huge number of Tennesseans involved in this war even gave its nickname, The Volunteer State to Tennessee) and so had the ensuing panic that is to say a period of financial distress which followed. In Tennessee, reconstruction was also achieved by education. This transition started sooner in Tennessee and permitted the development, the democratization and the modernization of the state. For that matter, women education is still considered as an indicator for the level of development.

There were a total of 3,610 ","school-aged children and of that number 1,545 were actually enrolled in the public ","schools, which was the average ratio of the entire South. Of the 3,610 school-age ","children, 2,416 were white and 1,194 were black according to the census of 1890. Of the ","1,545 enrolled children, 1,086 were white and only 459 were colored which showed a ","non-proportional ratio between the total school-age population and the number actually ","enrolled. The average age for enrolled children was 11.5 years old and high-school ","students were figured into this average. Among those studying higher branches sixty ","were white and five were colored. Clearly white children had an educational advantage ","over the black children both in class sizes and resources. ","There were more females than males employed as teachers in both racial ","classifications. There was one white male teacher, and 17 white female teachers. There ","was one colored male teacher and six colored female teachers. Females at this point ","dominated the teaching positions in Portsmouth, and it was an improvement from the ","previous amounts of work that women were allowed to do. According to William ","Cooper, this was one of the few professions that women dominated statistically after the ","Reconstruction in the South. The outlook of women as domestic caretakers was ","becoming more archaic both in Central Virginia and the South as a whole. ","These educational statistics were not only characteristic of Central Virginia. ","Although there were some educational opportunities for black children, the situation was ","clearly not in their favor. After the Civil War ended and blacks were liberated, economic ","and social conditions improved immensely. Nonetheless due to the major setback and the ","disadvantage of being enslaved, the white children still had the better educational ","resources, thus more of them went to higher-level classes in relation to the number of ","black children. This type of advancement was present in all aspects of the black ","population, both economically and socially.","The South lagged behind in education in comparison to the rest of the country, ","and this awareness began to take action in the late nineteenth century.

In most ","states, funding per child was less than a dollar. The lowest consisted of Alabama and ","North Carolina with 50 cents, and South Carolina spent 67 cents per child.

One not only had to be intelligent, but also wealthy. James N. Greear of Scott County, Virginia was one such man. In a letter home, Greear informed his father of his great interest in medicine and of the recent examinations he had taken. He noted that he had taken the examinations necessary to graduate though he was not sure of his intentions to apply for graduation. A majority of his letter revolves around his financial situation. Knowing it would be of keen interest to his father, he writes that he has spent ?not a lot? of money and then cites each of his expenses and its monetary value. Greear goes on to inquire about his father?s farming situation in Scott County. He asks where his father had been selling his corn crop and how much more clearing of the crop he had left. Noting it was April, he wondered if an early spring would reap more fruit. His inquiry into his father?s corn success is in fact Greear?s only interest in his home town affairs. ","Many southerners were forced to make an entire living off of a single crop. James Greear?s great interest in his father?s corn crop is due to the fact that his tuition money was most likely the direct result of that crop. Corn had been grown in Appalachia for many years before white settlers arrived there. Cherokee Indians, who inhabited the land during the frontier period, heavily influenced the whites that later settled there. Wheat was at first very difficult to grow in Virginia due to high counts of nitrogen in the soil and the difficulty in uprooting tree stumps. Adopting the techniques of the native Cherokee, corn became the most commonly grown crop in Appalachia. Corn took very little effort to grow and thus early on in the settlement of the colonies, most farmers grew it. While by 1882 southern agriculture had become far more diversified, the demand for corn was still present. It is no surprise that James Greear?s letter is mainly focused on his expenses at school and the success of his father?s corn crop. One poor harvest could devastate a farmer financially. Agriculture created some of the wealthiest men in not only the South but the entire country. It allowed fathers to send their sons to the best schools, and those sons to go off and become doctors, as in James Greear?s case, or return to the highly profitable family business."],"display_date":"April 16, 1882 - December 31, 1882","search_date":"1882-08-23","locations":[{"id":14262,"lat":36.7142218778,"lng":-82.6029814945,"zoom":10,"place":"SCOTT, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3149,"title":"The Death of John H.

John Crease's daughter received a letter from her grandmother expressing her condolences. The grandmother had written the letter on December 15, 1872, when she had received a telegram notifying her of Crease's death. The grandmother assured Crease's daughter that her father would be missed. She also assured her that her father had gone on to a better place, and continues to use religion to try and comfort her granddaughter. In her letter the grandmother also addressed happier topics such as the news of some of the family's children and their education. The grandmother talked about one of the younger girls wanting to go to school, and how the grandmother thought that it would be a good influence on her.","The religious language, such as you dear fatherless ones God has promised to be a father to you, a Shepherd, that the grandmother used to comfort Crease's daughter indicates that the grandmother, and probably the granddaughter as well, were on some level religious and likely belonged to a church. Religion in the South after the Civil War was complicated and varied. Methodism and many other new sects evolved from the frustration many Southerners felt about their new life. Church membership ranged from merely 10 percent in some counties to 60 percent in others. Overall, however, every southern state had a growth in the church population, with women constituting two-thirds of that population. Like African Americans, women were able to find leadership positions in the church that were unavailable to them elsewhere. African American churches during the era focused on the common interest and solidarity that linked the freedmen, and white women focused on these traits within the church as well. The fact that a southern woman like the grandmother used religious language to try and comfort her granddaughter shows how southern women were able to find strength in the church.","The grandmother also talked about the positive influence schooling had on the family's children, which was an aspect of southern education that would not be seen only five years later after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The children probably attended a public school because there were only two parochial schools in all of Arkansas by 1877.

They declared their overarching objective to be the advancement of science, and, despite a great deal of bureaucracy, at least improved their own knowledge during each meeting. The Academy consisted of a certain group of 27 gentlemen, each one an original member and founder. They had strict rules about admitting other gentlemen and under no circumstances allowed women into their organization. This Academy was intended to further scientific knowledge, and generally succeeded in doing just that, despite giving off intimidating airs of self-importance. The years leading up to the Civil War were filled with political and economic overtones. The Union expanded its area and admitting new states into its ranks, the debate about slavery raged on, traders continued to do brisk business, abolitionists picked up steam, merchants shipped cotton all over the world, life carried on. The natural surroundings provided a constant backdrop for the many Americans buying and selling, arguing and forgiving, growing and producing. Most importantly, they also equipped the nation with a climate that made agriculture such a successful venture in its southern states."," The members of the New Orleans Academy of the Sciences were not as interested in the ramifications of this economic viability as they were in the natural processes themselves. These gentlemen went on to suggest a method of using levees and canals to protect the city from Mississippi River floods, and also made daily meteorological notes. This natural world, which provided both rationalizations for keeping people in bondage and for their owners to make a great deal of money as a result, greatly fascinated the Academy members. Many of them wrote their own individual papers - and presented the research to their fellow members - that stemmed from this absorption with their natural and scientific settings. "," Understandably, that same natural atmosphere affected the Academy members in very real ways. For example, yellow fever breakouts caused meeting suspensions in the summer months. Undoubtedly, inclement weather occasionally prevented some of them from being able to attend their meetings. Regardless, or perhaps because, of the way that nature affected their day to day existence, the members of the New Orleans Academy of the Sciences believed in the work they were doing.

Washington at the Atlanta Cotton Exposition on Wednesday, September 18, 1895. The talented representative of the negroes and President of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School spoke brilliantly and passionately as he lobbied for African American employment in the burgeoning industrial age. He called upon whites throughout the nation to recognize the burgeoning African American population and their subsequent need of employment in the great leap from slavery to freedom. African Americans had worked under the white yoke for years on end. Could whites yet again place their trust in African Americans to till their fields, plant their crops, and strengthen their business? Washington implored whites to reject the massive influx of immigrants as a source of labor. Why test the mettle of the Irish, Italian, and Eastern European, when a solid and trustworthy base of employment lay right under their nose? The crowd assembled to listen to his speech seized upon several points in Washington's speech, but the passage which best encapsulates his message follows:","To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were I permitted, I would repeat what I say to own race: 'cast down your bucket were you are.' Cast it down among 8,000,000 negroes whose habits you know, whose loyalty and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides. Cast down your buckets among these people who have without strikes and labor wards, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, built your railroads and cities and brought forth treasure form the bowels of the earth and helped make possible this magnificent presentation of the progress of the South. ","Applauded by both blacks and whites alike, Washington's address was one of the most poignant of the entire Convention and arguably in American history. Though some criticized his speech as accomodationist and pandering to the white population, it was still critical in guiding African American resistance to white discrimination and establishing Washington as one of the leading African American spokesmen in America. Ardent in his devotion to African American advancement and education, Washington continued his cooperation with white people, enlisting the support of wealthy philanthropists, to raise funds to establish and operate hundreds of small African American community schools and institutions of higher education.","Reverberations from Washtington's Atlanta Compromise Speech, as it was later called, continue to influence racial politics to this very day. The supposed accomodationist ideas of Washington were frequently juxtaposed with those of other African American leaders of the time. In particular, Frederick Douglass called upon African Americans to Agitate, Agitate, Agitate for social change whereas Washington stressed compliance and hardy work ethic. Washington's ideals also conflicted with other individuals like W.E.B. DuBois who supported the idea of a classical education among African-Americans rather than the industrial model which Washington favored. Both sides sought to define the best means to improve the conditions of the post-Civil War African-American community. Washington's advice to African-Americans was to compromise and accept segregation; however, this perspective incensed other activists like DuBois who labeled him The Great Accommodator."],"display_date":"September 18, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-18","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3179,"title":"Iveson L.

Hundreds of thousands of Southerners followed the flourishing Christian principals, and Iveson L. Brookes was no different. He encountered the tenants of the Baptist tradition and became a devout follower. Brookes completed his coursework from the University of North Carolina in 1819 and spread the Baptist gospel throughout the South for numerous years thereafter. In October 1821, William Williams, an administrator at Eatonton Academy, requested that Brookes become the school's rector. Williams's letter to Brookes detailed the amount the Board of Trustees planned to pay him, the daily schedule of the school throughout the year, the meeting times of the surrounding Baptist churches, and Brookes' responsibility as a teacher, preacher, and rector of the school.","Because of the intensification of the importance of religion in the South, southern schools searched for dedicated and religious men as additions to their teaching staff. As Williams wrote to Brookes, he described the surrounding area as boasting four or five churches within 7 miles of Eatonton Academy. Baptist missionary fervor and unremitting evangelicalism had greatly expanded since the Baptists widened their outreach in the late eighteenth Century. Additionally, the religion developed because of its national view, appeal throughout all socioeconomic classes, and advocacy for the separation of church and state and religious freedom. Moreover, Baptist leaders spread religion and culture throughout the nation, and they knew that education was the most direct route. They created Baptist colleges and urged actions like that of Mr. Williams. Many Baptists, like Brookes, developed a missionary zeal and spread the word of God throughout the region. He committed himself to the Baptist theology, and Eatonton Academy wanted his services.","Educational standards had also reached a critical point in the Georgia Piedmont. Private, secondary school education developed a regimented, organized structure. The board of trustees stood at the top echelon of the composition, and it designated teachers' salaries and recommended faculty and administrative appointments.

In the late 1810's and early 1820's, he continued his strong relationships that he had established in France while holding his position of U.S. charge d'affaires. He sent a letter to Mr. P. McCrady, requesting the acquisition of several laboratory materials, and in the letter he ordered one small tabulator that was 1.50 and four test tubes that were 2.12 total.

Rambin explained to her sister that the effort she put into cooking, housework, and the washing caused her to seldom feel like writing. Rambin put special emphasis on the fact that she did her own washing, because many women paid others to do their washing for them. Rambin told her sister that she too could pay someone to do her washing, but preferred to do it herself while she could. Rambin, however, did have help in the kitchen from the hired African American who stayed in the kitchen to get her water and wood.","In the letter to her sister, Rambin also addressed the issue of the girls' (presumably her daughters') schooling. Rambin did not see the point in the girls continuing to go to school for much longer, unless they meant to become teachers. Rambin found the idea of the girls learning French especially ridiculous, since she noted that what French I learned was of very little use to me...and if they were to remain in Louisiana they would not have much use to practice it. She also asked if her sister would write to May M. Allen to see if she would be willing to come to De Soto, Louisiana, to either live with Rambin to teach her children or to teach at the local Catholic Community School. Rambin, however, expressed her fears that Allen would marry and give up teaching, leaving Rambin to finish educating her children on her own.","Rambin's chief concern in her letter, her housework, represents the adjustment many white women had to make after emancipation. They found themselves needing to do their own housework, which required a large amount of time from the former plantation mistresses. Laundry could take up to three days to do, and women often spent just as much time sewing and mending the clothes. In addition to this, women needed to cook, bake, and keep the house clean. Rambin might have been willing to do her own washing, but she still turned to an African American to complete the tasks she did not have time to do herself, and could afford to allocate to someone else. Even with the help of a few African American servants, the adjustment for Southern women to household work often caused resentment towards the North, which was a dominant sentiment in the South during Reconstruction.","Rambin's letter also addresses the changes of education in the South and women's role in education. During and after Reconstruction, Louisiana experienced a statewide decline in public education that resulted in a decrease in white literacy between 1880 and 1890. Private and parochial schools, such as the Catholic Community School Rambin mentions, were often used by whites instead of the poor quality public schools. Rambin did not mention if it was the decline in the educational system that prompted her dislike of keeping her girls in school, but if the Rambins were paying for the girls' education the economic hardship that was continually present in the South probably created a more important use of the money than tutoring in French. Her willingness to allow them to continue school to become teachers reflects the start in the increased amount of female teachers, which would double in number during the upcoming 1880s.

The event was entirely free to all members of the Teachers' Assembly who held Certificates of Membership.","By 1892, the Teachers' Assembly was a rapidly expanding organization whose success was due large in part to the general prosperity and expansion of the school systems throughout North Carolina. The annual sessions helped to encourage and inspire the teachers to continue their labor, in addition to providing support and appreciation for their hard work throughout the year. The teaching profession offered an outlet for woman to operate outside the home and thus gave them a degree of autonomy that many did not enjoy in other facets of their lives.","Lefler and Newsome described the 1880s and early 1890s as a time of much reform to the education systems in the South. Many new graded schools and colleges opened in North Carolina throughout the 1880s and 1890s. This era was the beginning of separate segregated schools for the blacks and whites in North Carolina and the beginning of a movement that saw the opening of colleges throughout the state. Lefler and Newsome stressed that while there were increasing opportunities for minorities to become educated, the white Americans continued to control the school systems and received the best education. Thus, it is likely that the Teacher's Assembly session was limited to people who taught in white schools."],"display_date":"June 21, 1892 - July 4, 1892","search_date":"1892-06-27","locations":[{"id":9234,"lat":35.538020448,"lng":-77.0550206325,"zoom":9,"place":"BEAUFORT, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3240,"title":"A Reporters Response to Frederick Douglass\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-07","end_date":"1895-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 7, 1895 an African American reporter wrote quite a compelling article in New South, a local black newspaper in Beaufort, South Carolina.

It was a crusade for self-improvement and the industrial work ethic. One man from nearby Washington, N.C., only identified as 'A Free Drinker,' felt he had to speak up. In a letter to the editor, the writer reminded the reading public that there were two sides to the issue, and the logic of the temperance movement was flawed on many accounts. Not all those who drank were sordid drunks, as the temperance societies believed. These societies opposed the drinking of all liquor, never mind how good the quality or how small the quantity. Drinking was not an idle habit, but rather a stimulating social activity. Jovial parties and pleasant games went well with a glass of the best. The temperance societies would use the money from alcohol on things like clothing and education for the children, but the writer noted that dressing up children only corrupts them and makes them arrogant. He went on, And as to giving children an education, I am inclined to think the policy of it rather doubtful... You have no doubt heard, sir, of the great number of forgeries that have been made of late years on banks and merchants. Now if these guilty persons had never learned to read and write, could they have committed these forgeries? The rhetoric of sarcasm veiled his disregard for these moral reformers. He went on to reveal that his wife nearly forced him to join one of these temperance societies, but a friend informed him that pledging to join was a sin - and he could not commit a known sin As if to perfectly demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the temperance societies in east North Carolina, the same friend quipped, There was a great deal of liquor in town that had to be drank by somebody.","Temperance societies emerged around the same time in the North and the South, in the 1830s. Yet the issue did not seem to resonate with many Southerners, especially the wealthy population of the Carolina coast. Many historians believe the movement lagged behind in the South because its citizens feared that the cause of temperance was tied to the cause of abolitionism. The temperance unions that did form in the South always made their proslavery opinions publicly known. Yet, as Ian Tyrell notes, this notion does not explain the whole issue. Many southern slaveholders joined the temperance reformers, voicing concerns about the public drunkenness of slaves and free blacks. In fact, what the South lacked that the North possessed was a growing immigrant population and a social environment of urbanization. The people that supported the temperance movements in the South were not the farmers and planters: they were the artisans and merchants, the laboring middle class. These urban occupations were not as socially prominent in South. For the majority, the drunkards being discussed in the <em>Newbern Spectator</em> were more like fictional characters than everyday reality. Without an economic transformation, the South maintained much of its pre-industrial character that deterred modern social reforms from gaining a momentum."],"display_date":"February 19, 1842","search_date":"1842-02-19","locations":[{"id":9860,"lat":35.9347277088,"lng":-76.3834640216,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3334,"title":"Mummy Visits Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-01-31","end_date":"1824-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Lady of Thebes Mummy was exhibited in Charleston and described in the Charleston Courier on January 31, 1824.

Members depended on their respective churches for support and community. Congregations viewed themselves based upon their past history, but also endeavored to contribute to the spread of their belief system. By supporting the growth and expansion of their religious institutions both locally and regionally, blacks created social networks that crossed state borders.

This was reported in the <em>City Gazette</em> and <em>Commercial Daily Advertiser </em>for months. He had been a paper boy (carrier of the <em>City Gazette</em>) and was able to read and write. He was formerly enslaved in Virginia (his mother was still there) and worked for the Petersburg Intelligencer. He was known for his skill at the printing press. ","The owner believed that Tom had left Charleston by ship and perhaps had forged his own free papers. The owner thought he may have been pretending to need passage to a Camp Meeting. Camp Meetings were the religious craze of the era and were connected most with the Methodist Church. There was a camp meeting being held at a local creek, and it would have considered un-Christian to refuse passage of a black man to a religious service. Many whites justified slavery as a way to spread Christianity to people who would otherwise live without it. ","There were rewards for the return of Tom to the owner (B.S. Thomas) that increased depending on the effort involved in Tom's return. His description is given as 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a bright yellow complexion. Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free. Considering his education and connections, Tom would have been able to get away with a lot of things without being questioned. ","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822. The Negro Seaman Acts required black seamen to be locked up while not at sea, so any black man on a ship was assumed to be a run away, and to prevent the black seaman from instigating trouble among the slaves."],"display_date":"May 2, 1815","search_date":"1815-05-02","locations":[{"id":11452,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3410,"title":"A Change in Direction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-06","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["1897 was an important year for the educational system of Maryland, and subsequently, the South as a whole. Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

The core of Lear's plan was to purchase young slaves and for them Education in plain literature & mechanical arts, and at a proper age transport them to the Colony in Africa to be as useful there as they may. Lear's letter also related to Randolph the following information about Jefferson's attitude toward the fund he approved very heartily the plan I then proposed to adopt, tho' he declined to give any advice or express any opinion in the matter, considering himself - now without authority."," Lear wrote this letter shortly after meeting with northern groups dedicated to the education of free blacks. The African School in New Jersey had been established in 1817 by the Presbyterian Synod of New York. New York Protestants created the school for the specific the goal of instructing blacks as preachers and teachers. Once free black people received such an education, they could be sent to Liberia or Haiti to help establish stable societies. This plan accorded with the vision of the American Colonization Society, a national initiative established in 1818, which channeled white efforts to cautiously deal with the slavery question. Whites Americans who supported plans in which education and colonization for blacks went hand in hand tended not to address a related question: If, as they believed, free blacks could become good citizens of an overseas colony through education, why could they not do so in America? Most free blacks roundly opposed colonization; they preferred to remain in the only country their family had known for generations, and work there for the freedom of black Americans still in slavery. Only about 15,000 free American blacks moved to Liberia over three decades time. Of those who did colonize, many professed a desire to spread Christianity by missionary work.","Despite the ideological support groups of white Americans sometimes afforded plans to educate blacks, and widespread backing among African Americans themselves, the support often took inadequate financial form. The African School of New Jersey ran out of money within a few years after its establishment. As it turns out, Kosciusko's fund could not be used to support it as Lear and Randolph had hoped.

Pearce learned this first-hand. In the narrative about his life, Pearce related the story of the death of Robert Scott at the hands of Thomas Phipps. Although Pearce was not an eyewitness to the crime, he insisted on an inquest into the murder and served as one of the jurors during the investigation. According to witnesses, a fight broke out between the two men during a drinking frolick and Phipps began harassing Scott without cause. Scott's death occurred three days after this fight so therefore the crime was not a drunken crime of passion. Although it is impossible to know about a specific animosity between the two men, it can be inferred from the narrative that there was an underlying cause for Scott's death. After seeing Scott's body, Pearce asserted that Scott's injuries were made evidently with a club which matched with the threat Phipps made to Scott that he would beat him to death with a club.","This incident demonstrates the way in which unrestrained individualism caused by grasping for wealth can hurt communities. The settlements themselves were isolated and Pearce himself was more than unhappy...by being secluded from society. This isolation caused intellectual and cultural sterility of the community which in turn meant that the enormous educational needs of the settlement were neglected. The education Pearce desperately wanted for his children was not the community focus because commercial transactions [were] indeed the prime objects of attention. The children were instructed about crops and horses instead of reading and writing in such settlements.","It is evident through the brutal death of Robert Scott and Pearce's experience on a Mississippi River plantation that the competitive nature of frontier settlements cut great inroads into person and public honesty by turning its members into ambitious seekers-after-power. It is hard to tell the exact cause for Scott's death but Pearce knew that the constant quarreling among those around him led to several hair-breadth escapes from murder. The death of Scott was no stretch of the imagination for Pearce and he recognized the injustice of the situation he was in. Life on the plantation frontier focused on individual gain and therefore Scott's death was most likely one of many that occurred among men grasping for wealth."],"display_date":1822,"search_date":"1822-07-02","locations":[{"id":5558,"lat":29.1734822816,"lng":-90.5148369557,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3486,"title":"Abolitionist Expelled from Bethany College\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-10-12","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was the fall of 1855; Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia had been in session for only a few weeks when an incident shattered the equanimity of the student population. Five northern students were dismissed for trying to introduce their Abolitionism into the college, into its literary societies, and into the church, according to the college president and founder, famed Restoration minister Alexander Campbell. On October 12th the A.L. Institute, a college literary society, was holding a debate on the topic of The Right of Christians to Engage in War when a student, Mr. Everest of Ohio, remarked that 'the arguments from the Bible to sustain war, polygamy, and slavery belong in the same category.' The following Sunday night, another young student from Ohio, Mr. Way, again pressed the issue when speaking of Satan's misquoting and misapplying the scriptures when he tempted our Savior - he remarked that 'Satan's emissaries often misquote and misapply Scripture to sustain intemperance, spiritualism, and slavery.' On this night, the challenge was not ignored by the southern students present but called forth many threats and expressions of indignation. These two students, along with three of their classmates, were promptly expelled.","Little is known of what happened to these young abolitionists, though there is evidence that they returned north and told their story to several newspapers in the upper Midwest. But it is the use of Biblical scripture to argue against slavery that stands out in this narrative. The radical Christian reform movement was reaching its zenith around the 1850s with the rise of the religious abolitionist movement, as well as the temperance and pacifist movements.","Highlighted in the student's arguments, however, is one of the tensions inherent in antebellum religious reasoning against slavery. The Christian anti-slavery movement faced a difficult problem in refuting the southern slaveholder's claims that a literal interpretation of the Bible supported slavery. Thus, the question for the abolitionists became how to repudiate slavery in the Bible without refuting all scripture. Everest and Way addressed this problem by linking the Bible's support of slavery to its support of other practices widely acknowledged as socially unacceptable, like polygamy. They also linked slavery to the other major reform movements of the time by mentioning intemperance and war. But their argument also raises the issue of where to draw the line on literal biblical interpretation. This issue became a theological quagmire for many Christian abolitionists at the time, difficult to escape, and one that limited effective use of the Bible in the argument against the South's peculiar institution.","This story is indicative of the high tensions and conflicts that prevailed among all levels of American society at this time, North and South, abolitionist and slave-owner, theologian and educator, especially over the issue of slavery. The Bible would soon be interpreted in a very different way, as both the North and the South would use passages to support their separate causes in the Civil War. The strong religious overtones of the coming Civil War are evident in this episode, and would mark much of the rhetoric that led up to the beginning of hostilities in 1860."],"display_date":"October 12, 1855 - December 31, 1856","search_date":"1856-05-22","locations":[{"id":14552,"lat":40.2733368751,"lng":-80.5764577451,"zoom":11,"place":"BROOKE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3487,"title":"Scientific Expeditions in Kentucky\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-01-01","end_date":"1819-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was a discovery for the ages. John Clifford's exploratory work in the hills of rural Kentucky had uncovered an extinct specimen key to the development of the field of naturalism: the univalve flinty shell. In 1819, the good scientist unabashedly declared it highly valuable and [it] will be deemed as such by all the enlightened naturalists of America and Europe. In Garrard and Estill counties, Clifford focused on finding the abundant fossilized remains of shells and animals while learning more about the local mineral endowment. His breakthrough with fossils was embodied by his gathering of five new genera and eighty new species of shells and polyps. In the end, his tireless efforts resulted in the collection of many useful specimens intended for the development of a museum.  Transylvania University's Professor C.S. Rafinesque also spent his summer trek productively in the Kentucky hills in 1819. As a Professor of Botany and Natural History, he was well qualified to uncover six new genera as well as thirty new species of plants, animals, fish, shells, insects etc. "," Clifford, Rafinesque and their work were unique. The North's scientific achievements dwarfed those of the South in the nineteenth century. Among the top American contributors to various scientific journals, few worked primarily in the South and fewer still were born there. Some scholars contend that slavery created an anti-intellectualism that limited progress in the region. As the nineteenth century progressed, scientific pursuits faced mounting criticism in the South if their work did not lend support to southern causes like slavery. There was increasingly less tolerance for purely theoretical work. The South did not support science as much as the North, but its record improved throughout the 1800s. Relatively few scientific journals begun before 1849 were edited in the South, but this rose by a substantial 10 percent from the 1820s to the 1840s. Within the South, wealth determined relative scientific accomplishment with rich South Carolina and Virginia leading poorer states like Kentucky. "," The anti-intellectualism created by slavery limited its scientific progress, but the South's agrarian focus also played a large role in limiting its contributions to science relative to the North. Research indicates that rural non-slaveholding areas like the old Northwest and certain parts of New England also faced a dearth of scientific achievement compared to the size of their populations. Throughout the country, urban areas with their libraries and wealthy commercial classes supported most scientists, but the South did not have many large urban areas in 1819."],"display_date":1819,"search_date":"1819-07-02","locations":[{"id":5193,"lat":38.3999013329,"lng":-84.0147666838,"zoom":9,"place":"NICHOLAS, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3506,"title":"Teaching the Catechism to Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-06-26","end_date":"1858-06-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though this episode originally took place in Alabama, it was reprinted on the front page of the Ceredo Crescent in western Virginia. A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation. This rivalry was still a factor in many parts of the South, even in the 1850s, especially in the less settled regions. Many parts of western Virginia were still wilderness at this time, and so this story would hold particular relevance for those in the less settled parts of the state."],"display_date":"June 26, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-26","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3537,"title":"Mr. Jefferson&#39;s University\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-08-01","end_date":"1819-01-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Thomas Jefferson's dream of a truly public university for Virginia came a step closer to being realized when the appointed commissioners of the yet-to-be built university met at Rockfish Gap, in Augusta County Virginia, on August 1, 1818. The purpose of the meeting was to pick a location for the university from three different choices: Lexington in Rockbridge County, Staunton in Augusta, or the site of Central College in Charlottesville, in Albemarle. Key to their decision was the degree of proximity and centrality to the white population which alone constituted the important point of comparison between these places, and the commissioners decided that Central College in Charlottesville, being on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was that central point. The commission, Jefferson included, went on to lay out a sketch of the University, naming its curriculum, the cost of buildings, and its general goals."," However, the controversy was not yet over. In January of the following year, there was a motion in the Virginia House of Delegates to strike out the Charlottesville location and reintroduce the possibility of Staunton or Lexington. According to the Alexandria Herald of January 20, 1819, a Mr. [Briscoe] Baldwin spoke in favor of Augusta County. After a debate, in which fine bursts of eloquence relieved the dryness of geographical details and arithmetical calculations, the motion was voted down 69 to 114."," The formation of public universities, like the University of Virginia, provided a means for Southern elite to come together and deepen ties of shared experience. Mr. Jefferson's University was the first of a wave of public schools chartered between 1819 and 1860-Alabama in 1820, Mississippi in 1844, and Texas in 1858. As the historian Charles F. Irons notes, this trend highlights the strategy of southern leaders and elites to educate successive generations in a shared ideology and groom them for public service. With the centrality of slavery to the southern economy and psyche, it was important that those with the most at stake develop tools, like the public universities, to continue a sense of political community. The extent that this was successful becomes clear in Edward Ayers account of Augusta County from 1859 to 1863, <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</em>, in which most of the prominent men of Augusta were schooled at the university that almost found itself situated in their county."],"display_date":"August 1, 1818 - January 20, 1819","search_date":"1818-10-26","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3554,"title":"The Establishment of the First Black Law School\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-04","end_date":"1869-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["African Americans never enjoyed exclusive access to law schools, much less to graduate schools in general.

Langston himself was the founding Dean of the law school and thus, a major contributor to the school's establishment.

As a result of the establishment of black colleges and graduate schools, there emerged a class of black professionals who further strengthened the black communities that were excluded from mainstream white society. Furthermore, it is especially significant that blacks were able to earn law degrees at a time when the rights of blacks had only recently been recognized, and thus, were especially in need of defense and protection. Black lawyers were also much more likely to take on the cases of black clients, as well as to better represent them, due to their common backgrounds."],"display_date":"January 4, 1869","search_date":"1869-01-04","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3573,"title":"E.W.

Hubard of Washington, D.C. wrote a letter to his nephew, James L. Hubard, of Buckingham County, Virginia. James was a young man at the time, still in the formative stages of his life, and it appears that he and his uncle corresponded regularly about education, family life, and women in central and northern Virginia. E.W. began the letter by acknowledging his receipt of James' last dispatch, dated the twentieth of January; during the mid-nineteenth century, parcel mail was still transported largely by horse-drawn carriage, so a three-week delivery period from Buckingham to Washington would not have been out of the ordinary. In the subsequent paragraphs, James' uncle addressed several aspects of the affluent, civilized lifestyle he led and advises his young nephew on the values of a southern gentleman. ","First, E.W. praised James for reading the new books that he sent to his nephew. James was very studious and intelligent, qualities evidenced by the fact that he finished the books very quickly and impressed his uncle with his voracious appetite for learning. E.W. could only hope, he wrote, that William, Robert, and Edmund (James' little brothers) follow in [his] good example and engage in reading and learning new literature. Next, the well heeled gentleman from the capitol city shared in his nephew's excitement over the success of his hunting and fishing expeditions. Although James wrote that he was a proficient shooter, he also expressed his dissatisfaction with his attempts at trapping. His uncle responded by offering his opinion on the two methods of hunting game, praising the virtues of trapping animals when he stated, It takes more sense and skill to out-wit and catch them, than to take your gun and shoot them. Trapping, he declared, is accomplished by tact and skill while hunting with a rifle depends on the force of powder and shot; this emphasis on guile and cunning is a recurring theme of E.W. Hubard's letter. Lastly, E.W. encouraged James to develop his musical talent, expressing his belief that those who are gifted with a particular acumen for singing or playing an instrument should nurture those talents and develop their abilities to fruition. In closing, James' benevolent uncle requested that he pass on his love to the rest of the family, including his younger brothers, and to tell them that he wishes he could one day correspond with them in the same manner as he and James did then. ","E.W. Hubard's letter to his nephew embodies several facets of southern gentlemanliness and reveals a great deal about the education and upbringing of affluent young men in central Virginia. E.W. urged his nephew to read as much as he can, not only in an effort to enhance his intrinsic worth, but also to uphold the tradition of the family of scholarly appearance and reputation. He repeatedly moralized the values of cleverness, exemplified in his lecture on the desirability of the crafty entrapment of game animals rather than the brute force method of shooting from afar. According to E. Brooks Holifield's <em>The Gentlemen Theologians</em>, Among the goals of piety, in relation to the ideal of southern gentlemanliness, were introspective watchfulness, purity of intention, strenuous inner discipline, and self-control. E.W. Hubard echoed these qualities in his letter to his nephew when he claimed that gentlemanly behavior develops from a keen intellect, quick wit, a rapacious desire for reading, and the ability to excel at music and dance. These characteristics and high aspirations colored the various political, social, and economic interactions of southern white gentlemen during the mid-nineteenth century in central Virginia as well as the American South as a whole."],"display_date":"February 9, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-09","locations":[{"id":13689,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3590,"title":"Graduation Day\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-05-28","end_date":"1886-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For four days, the Augusta Female Seminary, under the leadership of Mary Julia Baldwin, held commencement exercises for the class of 1886.

Miss Baldwin even noted that there were no deaths that year. She also believed that the school had succeeded in teaching the pupils practical skills for life and a deeper sense of their personal responsibility to God. The school gave awards for many different subjects, including Latin, French, German, Faithful Practice on Piano, and English composition.

The professors and instructors had titles, but the paper did not list the young women's names with Miss and some were in their common form, such as Annie instead of Anne and Lizzie instead of Elizabeth. "," Some young women attended Augusta Female Seminary for health reasons, but there were women attending because they had families who believed Catharine Beecher's principle that women needed a practical education to be successful mothers and wives and, eventually, she believed, have a profession. For the expanding middle class created by industrialization and urbanization in America, there began a trend to send young women to schools because the importance of women's work grew. According to Janet James, the question of to what extent women should be educated was entertained by everyone and in magazines, novels, plays and books. Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire.

But in the early summer of 1879 at the commencement exercises for Howard University, they did just that. The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites.

On March 31st, Jennie wrote, she and her friend Clara took a trip to the market in Washington, D.C. where they lived.  After marveling at the flowers and other wares, they decided to attend a nearby women's rights meeting. Jennie was not very impressed, despite being entertained by the goings on. She couldn't understand how women's lives and the state of things would be improved if women were given the right to vote. Not really very bothered, she and Clara finished their day with a trip to the dentist and dinner with family and friends.  ","Despite her nonchalance about the idea of women's suffrage, as viewed in this moment in her life, Jennie was an extremely self-empowered young woman. Her dedication to living a life full of education, religion, and social activities and events of all kinds is evident throughout her diary. As an upper-middle class young woman in Washington D.C., Jennie made a point to stay current on fashion, read novels such as '<em>Silas Marner'</em> or '<em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>' regularly, study and teach lessons for Sunday School, attend church and Christian Legion meetings, and do her domestic duties all at the same time.         ","Jennie's disinterest in the women's suffrage movement may then seem peculiar. However, Jennie was a Southerner, and the South was emerging from the Reconstruction Era in 1888. As the historian Louise M. Young explains, there was bitter resentment engendered in the South by the Reconstruction policies: a resentment that hardened into an emotional block against enfranchising women that was never resolved. Jennie enjoyed her life tremendously, from what she wrote in her diary, and enfranchisement wasn't going to add anything to her life that she felt she needed.

Though he had not yet passed away, the city was already mourning his inevitable passing that was sure to come within days.  The residents of Washington, D.C. had been proud to call Richard Wallach their Mayor for several years, and news of his impending death caused many to reflect on the beneficial impact he had had on the city and the well-being of all who lived in it. ","While he was mayor the City Hall, which had previously acquired the bad name of 'the Buzzard's Roost,' was very unhospitable quarters for the noble army of jobbers and strikers, said the <em>Star</em>, describing how full of integrity Mr. Wallach was. That same day, the <em>National Republican</em> sang his praises in an article entitled, 'Waiting for Death': As a citizen he was enterprising, energetic, liberal, laboring zealously and faithfully for the city, which appreciated his efforts on her behalf. Clearly, 'Dick' Wallach's personal and professional integrity had manifested itself in his mayoral accomplishments; the man had set the bar for mayors in Washington's future.  Mr. Wallach passed away during the afternoon on March 4th, 1881. His funeral was attended by many prominent members of the community, black and white, male and female. ","What made Mr. Wallach's death so monumental to the Washington D.C. community was the fact that he symbolized all that education reform had done and was continuing to do for the community. Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3632,"title":"John J.

Education was a very important aspect of the Old South and was exemplified in Virginia by the work of Thomas Jefferson. The University of Virginia was the South's most original contribution to education. Ever since its opening in 1825, the University attracted young men from all over the South including the cotton states in the southernmost part of the country. While the many universities across the Suth began to endure success, so to did the secondary schools. These institutions, called academies, were used to begin young boy's education on an array of different topics and prepare them for further learning at a university. The universities themselves such as Hampden-Sydney, Washington and Lee, and Virginia had all grown out such organizations. Many plantation owners sent their sons away to academies because they wished for them to acquire the training of gentleman. One such family was the Ambler family of Orange County, Virginia. In the summer of 1841, they sent their oldest son John J. Ambler away to Liberty Mills, an academy north of Orange run by a Mr. Abbott. On June 18, 1841, the Amblers received their first letter ever from John, informing them of his experience so far at Liberty Mills. He told them he was doing very well, and that Mr. Abbott had been teaching him spelling, geography, Latin, and history. Mr. Ambler replied saying, I hope my dear son you are perfectly content and happy and that you are learning very fast. Mr. Abbott later sent a report of John's development to the Ambler family and told them that his progress was highly credible, and that he never saw a better boy in the general department. ","This series of letters illustrate the importance of education and learning among the wealthy plantation owners in Virginia. They took pride in their estates and wanted their sons to develop into fine intelligent gentleman whom people could look up to. It also gives credit to the central region in Virginia which had the highest number of academies in the South. This area began stressing the importance of education and started the fight against the idea of illiteracy that hung over southern culture. John J. Ambler excelled in school during his year at Liberty Mills and would later go on to attend the University of Virginia.

The number of girls under the care of the Society was increased to twenty and a smallpox scare in the city required a visit from Society Physician Dr. Alex Whitehead for a round of vaccinations for all the girls. However, certainly the biggest event of the year happened in July when the Society received a letter from a generous citizen of the city. The letter was from the Executor of the will of Captain John Maxwell informing the Society that 2,500 had been bequeathed to them for the purpose of establishing an Asylum for Female Orphans. Additionally, Captain Maxwell's Executor had already purchased a lot on Brigg's Point for the new structure."," The 1816 annual report of the Female Orphan Society shows their elation at receiving such a large donation. The report states that they would desire... to proclaim our gratitude to our deceased benefactor & to God, the inspirer of all good, for this generous gift which promises to perpetuate our institution as a lasting honor & blessing to the community. Their happiness is well understood when one considers the average yearly earnings of a small-time farmer during the era was well under one thousand dollars. Simply put, 2,500 was a lot of money."," The Female Orphan Society was not a fledgling organization. It was founded in 1804 by Norfolk women in order to provide a temporary home, education and training for indigent white girls, orphans or otherwise. In order to stay afloat, the organization relied on the generosity of private individuals, churches, relief agencies, and finally clubs or other organizations to provide food, clothing, education for the wards, and wages for Society employees. The fact that after twelve years the organization had not yet acquired their own building shows the difficulty of financing a charitable organization such as the Society. In fact, at the time the Society received the donation, they were just deciding that they had sufficient funds to attempt to look for a lot for the construction of their own building. Such a large donation allowed the Society to build a larger building than perhaps they had hoped, enabling them to expand the breadth of their charitable work. Orphan Societies such as the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk factored greatly in the lives of America's poor children from the early nineteenth century until the 1920s. The Society of Norfolk was typical of these early institutions in that it was established to help female children and dealt mostly with children who had one or more parents living. These institutions served to help a family through tough times by providing for a child until the parent was able to do so themselves. The Norfolk Society was also indicative of Orphan Societies at the beginning of the nineteenth century in that it was entirely funded by private donations and managed by specific religious organizations. "," Orphan Societies began to be established in response to changes in the United States as a whole. During the early nineteenth century, American cities experienced massive growth due to European immigration. Cities grew by leaps and bounds and the population of urban poor grew with them. Additionally, the growth of wage labor often left many of these poor families unable to care for their children after a tragedy like the loss of a parent. Finally, improved transportation facilitated the easier spread of diseases like cholera, which led to a spike in the establishment of orphanages after an epidemic in the 1830s. By the Civil War, Orphan Societies had become very common across the United States and were thought of as being the best way to manage the upbringing and education of poor children outside of their own homes."],"display_date":"January 1, 1816 - January 1, 1817","search_date":"1816-07-02","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3646,"title":"Annual Report of the Norfolk Bible Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-03-07","end_date":"1815-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In early 1815, a charitable religious organization in Norfolk, Virginia by the name of the Norfolk Bible Society published its first annual report in the form of a small pamphlet. The pamphlet, which was presented at the annual meeting of the Society remarked upon both the activities of the Society in the past year as well as the Society's plans for the future. The pamphlet stated that the principal duty of the Society was that of procuring Bibles and Testaments and distributing them to the poor. The report stated that the Society had distributed 235 Bibles and 882 Testaments in the prior year. Some of these books were delivered to the poor of Norfolk, but others were delivered to the neighboring counties of Princess Anne, Nansemond, York, Elizabeth City, and even as far away as Matthews and across the Chesapeake Bay in Northampton. Donations were also made to the children under the care of the Norfolk Female Charitable Society and to the crew of the famous Navy vessel the <em>U.S.S. Constellation</em>. Finally, the Society made monetary donations, both to The Bible Society of Virginia and the Bible Society of New York for the printing of a French language edition to be donated to the poor inhabitants of Louisiana and Canada. The Norfolk Bible Society also listed future goals in its first annual report. The chief among these was the establishment of free schools for the poor. The Bible Society recognized that the poor, the objects of [their] charity, [were] often illiterate, and it [was] quite absurd to give them books which they [could not] read."," The beginnings of American mass media culture lay in the efforts of Bible Societies and religious Tract Societies that sprung up all over the country around 1800. The Bible and Tract Societies were highly organized groups that grew out of the missionary spirit of the Second Great Awakening in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These groups strove to put their printed religious materials in the hands of as many people as possible. The activities of these groups coincided with and served to drive the explosion of the American printing industry in the early nineteenth century. Small printing shops soon became ubiquitous while urban printing companies grew into truly massive industries that were intimately connected to religion. Early nineteenth century improvements in transportation combined with an increased access to capital brought on by the economic prosperity of the era allowed Tract and Bible Societies to reach a national audience. The distribution of religious texts was seen as a means of combating the problems of illiteracy and heathenism amongst the local poor and those living on the geographic margins of the United States."],"display_date":"March 7, 1815","search_date":"1815-03-07","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3662,"title":"Baptists Educating Women for the Sake of Men\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-08-11","end_date":"1854-08-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the Holston Baptist Association convened in 1854, the reverends of the association discussed the education of women. While 38 churches in attendance wanted to sustain denominational schools already in place, Reverend N. Baldwin, representing Abingdon, Virginia had a different suggestion. Baldwin's address began by accusing Europeans of being destroyers of Christian values. He argued that the European population and the laziness of southern gentlemen had transformed the South into a land of anti-Christian and anti-republican values. He argued that the only source of protection against the destruction of values and morality is a sound Christian education. Baldwin suggested that the association plant a school house and church on every hill and in every valley. ","According to Baldwin, not only education, but the education of women in particular was important. He said, Educate the mothers, train them up to their mission, and their sons will become intelligent and virtuous. He noted that there were 962,878 free white persons, who could not read nor write. He argued that the key to solving problems with males and their values was female education. By educating females, gentlemen would need to educate themselves in order to impress the women. Educating women set higher standards for men, thereby limiting troublesome male behavior. He shouted, Educate your daughters and the young men will seek and education to qualify themselves for their society...Wherever the Bible has been brought to bear on mankind, it has had an elevating effect on the moral character and social rank of women. The gospel has a peculiar elevating influence on the social and domestic state of woman. This Baptist institution hoped to use its efforts in faith to benefit the social good by having a well-behaved, educated population.","The arguments put forth by Baldwin reflected a larger sentiment at work in Baptist society. At about the same time Baldwin delivered his remarks from the pulpit, A.W. Richardson, a reverend from Alabama, echoed Baldwin: Educate the girls...and the boys in order to render themselves respectable in their eyes, will find means to educate themselves. Resulting from these Baptist opinions that women's education was essential, Baptists put their plan into action to develop schools, including the Brownsville Baptist Female College in western Tennessee. Female colleges created environments secluded from interruptions by boys, as women had no correspondence with gentlemen. The Baptists pitched the idea as a way to let daughters learn marketable skills such as teaching or bookkeeping before womanhood. The main theme underlying female education, however, was to keep young men from misbehaving.","Seeing such southern belles of high class, southern gentlemen would have to educate themselves and learn value, morality, and religion in order to even have a chance with educated women. Educating women in the antebellum South reflected larger Baptist values to cleanse the state of immorality and sectionalism. Likewise, the South needed to restore morals and values in its young men."],"display_date":"August 11, 1854","search_date":"1854-08-11","locations":[{"id":14343,"lat":36.7220692336,"lng":-81.9642215133,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3683,"title":"Importance of Education   \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A focused, open-minded man capable of sound reasoning and clear expression- these, according to John Broadus, were the characteristics distinguishing an educated man. The Baptist minister was a fierce advocate of higher education and lamented the fact that many young men attended schooling in their younger years, but, when about to enter the potential peak of their intellectual growth, chose to be practical and headed into business instead. Thus, Broadus set out in his essay to detail how college could benefit all men, including those destined for business as a merchant, manufacturer, agriculturalist, and so on. Latin and Astronomy, for example, were often dismissed as useless subjects, but Broadus pointed out that these branches could only strengthen the mind's thinking skills, which could then be applied to any field or situation. Wouldn't it be admirable if a merchant could make wise decisions based on complicated questions? An awareness of culture also contributed to the happiness of families, Broadus noticed, since men could teach their knowledge to their children. All in all, college, though expensive, would lead to enormous benefits in the future. And if a father's son refused to attend school? Argue with him, urged Broadus, exhort him, plead with him, and if he is still unwilling, make him go. "," The push for learning in this essay exhibits a wider sentiment that began in 1875 and continued through the twentieth century. A greater awareness of schooling had occurred during the early Reconstruction years due to state constitutions acknowledging citizens' right to education, but the general poverty of the South, combined with poor administration, led to a decline in schools and a high rate of adult illiteracy. In response, groups such as philanthropists, educators, and politicians aimed to remedy the situation by encouraging and providing education through various types of schools, including evening schools in textile communities and lay-by schools, schools that operated when cultivation of crops halted.

They lacked the professional help we are privileged to have today and therefore took illness and disease much more seriously. One such family was the Slaughter Family of Culpeper County, Virginia. The month of February, 1835, proved to be very difficult for Philip Slaughter, the man of the household, as he started to develop a cold on the thirteenth. In the next couple of days his condition became worse until on the seventeenth he was confined to [his] own bed in the afternoon. The other members of the Slaughter family believed that Philip?s condition was becoming very dangerous. Later that month, after loosing another close family member to sickness, the Slaughters predicted that he did not have much time left and that by the beginning of March he would surely have passed away. Instead, Mr. Slaughter started to become stronger and in about two weeks was able to walk around the room. By the twentieth of March he had fully recovered."," Many southern families turned to books for information on health and sickness. Domestic Medicine, Or Poor Man's Friend, In the Hours of Affliction, Pain and Sickness by Dr. John Gunn was first published in 1830 and became one of the leading books on medicine in the South during that time. Many southerners confided in his knowledge of medicine when they needed help. One point that Gunn raises in his book is the idea of education in the South. He believed that education needed to consist more in a knowledge of things, and less in a knowledge of mere words. Schools and universities spent too much time teaching subjects such as history and English when they needed to focus more on the sciences and the study of medicine. Because of this lack of focus, the general knowledge of sickness and medicine in central Virginia during this time was very low, leading to numerous deaths from common colds and diseases. "," This excerpt from Philip Slaughter's diary illustrates how important ideas of health were to people in central Virginia and all over the South. With the publication of Dr. Gunn's book, the study of medicine started to become very serious in the southern states as general education and research began to focus more on the sciences. Until then, though, people in central Virginia remained without substantial familiarity with sickness.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics. Jackson, against the bank for ideological reasons, fought to defeat it. He removed the bank deposits, effectively killing the bank in 1834. Directly as a result of this, the Whig Party formed in opposition to Jackson. John C. Calhoun, another opponent to Jackson, favored the bank and fought against Jackson when he removed the bank deposits."],"display_date":"December 13, 1848 - December 13, 1855","search_date":"1852-06-13","locations":[{"id":11504,"lat":33.8449766897,"lng":-81.9100531274,"zoom":8,"place":"EDGEFIELD, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3689,"title":"The Spartanburg Female College\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-08-22","end_date":"1855-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a hot sunny date in the upcountry of South Carolina, S. Bobo, the President of the Board of Trustees of the Spartanburg Female College, delivered an inauguration address for the founding of the all women's college. He carefully described the faculty, which included a minister, and the courses of study, ranging from reading and writing to arithmetic and geography. He pleaded with the audience to understand the importance of female education in Southern society. Women were expected to be good mothers, and he wanted to make each woman be a nobly-nursing wife because that is her great mission upon earth. Without proper education, he lamented, women were susceptible to corruption. Education provided the solution to maintaining a proper Southern culture. Without good mothers, he argued, future generations of children would not be raised properly. It was incumbent upon everyone to plan for the future; each one had a moral obligation. So, let your prayers unite with ours in behalf of this institution-so useful to women-so necessary to mankind-so honorable to its liberal founders.

However, there were women who protested this simple mindset, like Louisa McCord, as cited by the historian Michael O'Brien. Women like this provided reasons to create a college like this in order to teach women how to be 'proper'. She wrote an essay in 1852 called the Enfranchisement of Women. She advocated women's rights and wrote that women were out of place, unappreciated, having their talents and powers not only hidden under a bushel, but absolutely thrown away, while she becomes either the slave or the toy of men. As was the case with this college, women learned to read and write in order to be good wives, not for their own edification. Because some women, such as McCord, protested their treatment, the need to indoctrinate women to be subservient to their husbands became necessary. For this reason, educating women in Southern culture was very important.

These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time.

Such ads for girl's academies were not uncommon in the 1830s, for over the span of the early 1800s there was a growing trend for families to send their daughters to one of these schools if they could afford it. The popularity of these academies is best explained by the belief in the early 1800s that a good education was instrumental in preparing an upper class woman for her role in society and at home. Among the courses offered in the ad were \"French and English Languages, Sacred and Profane History, Ancient and Modern Geography, Mythology, and all the various types of Fancy and Ornamental Needlework.\" Such fields of study were common among these academies, although there were variances from school to school. The inclusion of needle work in the curriculum, however, is a bit uncommon, for although it was an important skill for most women in the antebellum period it was only taught in about thirty-percent of academies. In addition, courses in music and dance were offered in the ad but at an extra cost. This highlighted a common trend in the academy movement. While these fields were thought to be an important part of creating a lady, they lost value with a newer emphasis on more academic courses which had previously been for males only. Christie Farnham, in her <em>Educating the Southern Belle</em>, argues that this change occurred because of the changing ideas of the capacities of women. Because women were now thought to be just as capable as men they too could receive the same benefits of a liberal arts education as men did. And this was the main point of a woman's education, to make her a better person for her role in society. Thus, the knowledge gained in schooling was important in creating what was thought to be a proper lady."," In addition to the knowledge gained, a proper education was pivotal in creating a charming and sophisticated lady. And this highlighted an important role of a woman's education, as a sign of class distinction. One of the most prominent ways in which the upper-class distinguished itself from lower classes was with the refinement and knowledge gained from these institutions. It reinforced the idea that they were better than the people in these other groups by virtue of their knowledge and ability to interact in proper society. Such an ideal is played upon in the ad as when it states, \"Advantage will be taken of every opportunity to cultivate their minds, and qualify them for refined and polite society.\" Thus, in many respects a young ladies education was a defining symbol of her class status. Also, an education became a sign of class rank simply because of its immense cost. Tuitions were usually around 200 annually but could range much higher,  the ad's tuition is listed at the exorbitant price of 500, and this did not include other expenses such as clothing, transportation, extra classes, and so on. A woman's education was an expensive investment that could only be provided by those with high incomes. Therefore, women of high social status attended these academies in large numbers for it had become an integral part of their class rank and social status to do so.

A leather-bound book as tall as a man's forearm with robin's egg blue pages was then opened reverently, and a man's voice read aloud the last meeting's minutes.  After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

Alderman possessed a lot of state pride and felt North Carolina's history was vital to the history of the nation.  Alderman proved this point when he stated, \"in every civil, political, or military commotion of the past two centuries North Carolina has whirled in and done rough, sturdy work and has then gone about her business as if nothing much had happened.\"  He then described how college students should record the history of their home states, claiming that it would be beneficial for the students as well as the North Carolinians who followed.

Alderman believed throughout his life that education and history was important, and was known by his college graduating class as a great orator.  The message in his speech was strong and included many important aspects of North Carolina history.  However, Alderman left out the major historic events that had happened in the recent years.  Alderman almost ignored the Civil War, as well as slavery, in his speech.  ","    Politicians and speakers often avoided discussion of the Civil War during the late nineteenth century because there was a large controversy in regards to slavery and racial tensions.  People hotly debated the pros and cons of the establishing a national emancipation day as well as honoring Robert E. Lee with a statue in Richmond.  Historian William Blair reported that the Confederate flag still flew throughout the South, but many citizens believed it was a symbol of rebellion and disloyalty to the United States.  Alderman was avoiding conflict and hoping to maintain a positive reaction from his audience by omitting some key historic occurrences from his speech.

The citizens had decided they could only afford to spend 250, so they needed additional money from the school funds in each district.  At first, the task was deemed as impossible because of insufficient funds, so the school boards declined to aid them.  At a meeting two weeks later, the boards did not consider the citizens' pleas again for a new high school and adjourned the meeting quickly.  It was not until October 5, 1891 that the boards finally decided to take pity on the citizens, agreeing to give some of the limited funds to establish the school.  It was decided that another surrounding district would give 50 per year, and Roanoke, Madison, and Walton would furnish the school building and jointly contribute 80 per month, for seven months, to pay teachers.  The Boards also assigned committees to attempt to collect extra funds from county members.   For the next few months, there seemed to be only minor difficulties in establishing the school, but in February of 1892, it was brought to the attention of the boards that this process was not going smoothly.  The principal stated, \"it was not possible to make satisfactory progress in the school without additional teachers and more desks and supplies.\"  The school still needed a great deal of funds, and the board was only able to give them a small amount.  Again, in late July, the principal appeared in front of the boards asking for even more money.  However, the board said they did not have enough funds from the state government to give the high school.  Smithville High School would have to work with what they had.  It was not until a full year later that Madison, Roanoke, and Walton County School Boards were able to increase the funding for the school.  Therefore, for a great deal of time, poor white children were incapable of receiving a proper education.  ","    Smithville, Virginia was a perfect representation of the attempt for free education in the South in the late nineteenth century.  Unlike the North, the South had never had a system of free \"common\" schools.  All education was for wealthy white children with private and expensive tutors, or some form of private religious institution.  While the North began creating this public school system in the 1830s, the South did not start until after the Civil War.  However, the true beginnings of education expansion in the South only took root in the late nineteenth century, especially in the 1890s.  While the then stable state governments took control of all financial aspects of public education, there were still only special accounts with limited funds and strict restrictions on how the money could be spent.  Therefore, it was these special accounts that hindered Madison, Roanoke, and Walton County School Boards and other counties throughout the South to give sufficient money in order to create efficient and productive high schools.  Unfortunately, it took a few decades for public schools in the South to nearly match the high standard of education in the public schools of the North.  To this day, northern public school education tends to exceed that of the South.

He conveyed his deep desire to have President Cleveland attend the Lynchburg Fair in October in order to rescue Virginia from falling into the hands of the Mahoneites and out of the hands of the Democrats.  McDonald continued on in his letter to list the various means by which the President could arrive in Lynchburg and depart in a timely manner.  He even stated that he could easily extend the date of the Fair so as to accommodate Cleveland's schedule.  He signed his letter, \"your friend and obedient servant.\"","            McDonald's request came during the decline of Virginia's Readjuster Movement, led by William Mahone.  The movement aimed to lower state debt by enacting liberal reforms, including broadening education opportunities for black citizens.  Gaining the nickname \"the party of the Negro,\" the Readjuster Movement won a degree of support in the early 1880s for its financial policies.  Additionally, Mahone sought alliances with Republican officeholders in order to gain more political salience.  Pleas like that of McDonald arose, therefore, out of Democrats' fear of Republican and Readjuster control of state-and even national-politics.

In Lynchburg, former Confederate General Jubal Early avowed, \"the Negroes must know that they are to behave themselves and keep in their proper places.\"  McDonald believed that staunchly Democratic Cleveland was an effective counterbalance to the Readjuster movement, and he therefore attempted to feature him as the central figure in Lynchburg's 1887 Fair."],"display_date":"August 22, 1887","search_date":"1887-08-22","locations":[{"id":13702,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3937,"title":"A Long Awaited Education\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    A sense of pride and accomplishment overwhelmed Benjamin Franklin Yancey towards the end of the 1890s.  He had finally achieved a dream that he believed would change the lives of generations of young African Americans.  Yancey had overcome the obstacles of racist sentiments and segregation that were a widespread aspect of life in Albemarle County, Virginia. ","    Benjamin Franklin Yancey traveled to Albemarle  County in the early 1890s with a dream to educate African Americans.  He began fundraising projects to raise money to build a school on a former plantation in Scottsville,  Virginia.  Yancey firmly believed that a school for black youths would provide them with the skills they would need to move up in society.  However, as Yancey worked to create such a school, he faced numerous obstacles.  Particularly, the racial tensions that existed in Albemarle  County towards the end of the nineteenth century delayed Yancey's fundraising progress.  However, Yancey worked to overcome these obstacles and he eventually opened the doors to one of the first black schools in central Virginia, naming it the Esmont Colored  School.  Yancey, along with his wife, ran the school and taught young African American children basic skills such as reading and writing.  ","    During the post-emancipation years, African Americans faced great disadvantages in education.  These disparities, which began during slavery, continued into the era of Jim Crow, when black children were forbidden to attend school with white children.  \"Separate but equal\" schools were legalized in 1896 after the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson </em>ruling, however, the schools for black students rarely equaled those for white.   Blacks often faced extremely uncomfortable conditions and less than mediocre education.  In response to reports of these conditions, many educated Americans became active in the effort to educate freedmen.  Several individuals, like Benjamin Yancey, devoted the rest of their lives to the education of newly freed black Southerners.  As a result, schools for freedmen were rapidly being erected across the South.   These individuals embodied the ideals of Civil Rights activist W.E.B. DuBois, who stressed the importance of \"full educational opportunities.\"  Like DuBois, Yancey thought that the founding of the Esmont Colored School would give black Southerners the opportunity to move up in a world without slavery.

Lynn Lyerly, a historian who has studied women and religion in the South, discusses how many women in the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century South sought to engage in mission work outside of home and the church.  Numerous organizations of Protestant women sought not only to witness the Gospel to the public, but also to perform acts of kindness and charity for the less fortunate.","      According to historian Charles Wilson, Southern religion has always been heavily influenced by the Calvinists' negative attitude toward human nature.  For this reason, churches in the South tend to emphasize the need for a conversion through God's grace and a subsequent life of morality.  Wilson's assertions help explain Lyerly's description of many Southern women as motivated to evangelize and perform mission work outside their traditional spheres of influence.  Gregory seems to have been one of these women, seeing as she used her position as a teacher to spread the word of God in hopes of positively influencing the lives of her students.  In her own words, \"for the past two mornings our principal has opened the school by reading the Scriptures and prayer.  I am decidedly in favor of it-it will make a lasting impression upon the minds of the children.\"  Gregory's support of prayer and Bible-reading in school suggests a belief that children who are taught in a religious environment are likely to live more proper lives.

These letters began a correspondence between the young author and his mentor that would last over the next few years. Simms and Stoddard were both fairly highly regarded (Simms much more than Stoddard), but the men differed greatly in backgrounds and the kind of literature they produced.

First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.  Unfortunately, though, with the turn of the century, Edward Ayers notes that \"blacks in the south paid for schools for whites--not the other way around.  The more black citizens in a county, the greater the benefits to white students.\"  Racial tensions would not disappear for some time."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":13600,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3965,"title":"Education by Gender\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-03-01","end_date":"1856-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Charleston Mercury</em> ran an advertisement in March 1856 for the creation of a \"Preparatory Military School\" in Yorkville, South Carolina. Though the school was set to open nine years later, in 1865, the headmasters were thinking far ahead. The basic courseload for the school had arithmetic, history, geography, and grammar, while the advanced lessons included surveying, mythology, French, and, interestingly enough, brawling. The military instruction encompassed the command of squad and company as well. Ironically, the school seemed well prepared to deliver its students into the \"Military Institutions of the state,\" even though the administrators certainly had no way of knowing that a bloody and brutal war would be nearly over by the time the school was scheduled to open.","Though the advertisement specified ages for its pupils - between twelve and eighteen - there was no gender requirement. It is obvious that the students intended for this sort of education were male, since females were not allowed to fight in the army. Although the majority of Southern students - and therefore Southern schools - were male, there also existed a rather large number of female educational institutions. These schools were very rarely co-ed; young men and women were taught separately and, for much of the nineteenth century, different subjects. Women learned the French style of education, which focused primarily on needlework, the French language, and other ladylike occupations, but as times changed, both men and women at higher educational levels pushed for the same training for young women as was already in place for young men. Though military prep schools certainly remained an exception, women began to learn arithmetic, geography, grammar, and other liberal arts topics, instead of the French topics. Even if men were still the main focus of Southern educational systems, the instruction of women was not far behind. Indeed, Southerners who could afford an education were denied nothing based simply on gender.

In Hampden-Sidney College's yearly publication, The Kaleidoscope, students shared stories of pranks, sports victories, and rigorous course loads that could easily have been written by a college student today.  However, the influence of Greek life was much greater in the nineteenth century.  Especially at all-male schools, like many of the best were, fraternities were not an option, they were a way of life.","    The first collegiate society bearing Greek letters was founded at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1776.  This fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was founded as a secret organization with the express purpose of exploring and discussing literature with the other members of the society.  Phi Beta Kappa remained the only Greek letter organization on the collegiate scene until the founding of Chi Delta Theta at Yale in 1821.  Chi Delta Theta had a similar philosophy to Phi Beta Kappa, but was generally too large to encourage bonding and brotherhood amongst members.  The first fraternity that bore any resemblance to the modern social fraternity was Kappa Alpha, founded at Union College in 1825.  In 1827, Union was also the cradle for the creation of Sigma Phi and Delta Phi.  These three organizations became known as the Union Triad and were the models for other Greek letter organizations to follow.","    The first social fraternity to charter in the South was known as the Mystical Seven, and was founded at Emory College in 1841 and at Franklin College, later known as the University of Georgia, in 1844.  However, the first distinctively \"southern\" fraternity, WWW, was founded at the University of Mississippi in 1842.  The second fraternity to be deemed southern in nature was Sigma Alpha Epsilon, founded at the University of Alabama in 1856.  The dichotomy between southern and northern fraternities became clear during the Civil War.  Collegiate activity was largely suspended during the war, and although no new fraternities were founded, national pride became instilled in the brotherhoods.  After the war, many southern schools refused to re-charter fraternities that were founded in the North, and even went so far as to establish the Southern and Northern Orders of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity. ","    Fraternal rivalries existed not only between northern and southern fraternities, but also between fraternities at individual colleges.  As the Kaleidoscope shows, Hampden-Sidney chose to form a Pan-Hellenic council with representatives from each fraternity to ameliorate feuds between the young men.  The \"spirit of Pan-Hellenism\" at Hampden-Sidney was preserved through this council, and Pan-Hellenic councils still exists at many Universities today.  ","    In the grand scheme of American history, fraternities have played a much larger role than that any other collegiate social clubs have.  During the nineteenth century, the southern fraternity grew from a simple social organization to an institution used to perpetuate southern ideals and lifestyles.  Some of these ideals are very positive, such as honor, scholastic achievement, and brotherhood.  However, the southern fraternity has also become a vehicle to preserve less progressive ideals, such as racism, classism, and geographic discrimination.

In fact, Delaware was the only slaveholding state to enact prohibition laws in the 1850s.  However, temperance reform victories can be seen on a smaller, yet equally effective, scale throughout the southern United States, especially among young men.  The Southern temperance movement was driven by fraternal organizations of men, and eventually women, holding each other to the standard of temperance and encouraging themselves and others to lead a temperate lifestyle.","    The Sons of Temperance was the most widely known fraternal temperance organization.  The Order was founded by temperance advocates in New York City in 1842 but quickly became a nationally recognized brotherhood.  Its three goals were clearly laid out in the constitution of the organization, which \"proposed then, as it does now, three distinct objects-To shield its members from the evils of intemperance; afford mutual assistance in case of sickness, and elevate their character as men.\"  ","    Fraternal temperance orders became exceedingly popular in the south as the nineteenth century progressed.  Members from slave states comprised 44 percent of the national membership of the Sons of Temperance in 1850.  This is especially important because the Sons did not admit African Americans, and the South only represented 32 percent of the nation's total white population.  The Independent Order of Good Templars was another prominent fraternal organization dedicated to temperance, and also boasted a large southern participation rate.","    These orders tended to function like secret societies and rarely published their membership lists.  This was largely done in order to limit bad press.  It would have been extremely embarrassing for a brother to be seen violating the codes of the Order, and secrecy eliminated the possibility of bad exposure.  Another reason for secrecy became important when sectional differences began to get out of hand.  Since the society had Northern roots and linkages, many Southern chapters kept their activity under wraps so as not to anger the political powers at hand.

Raised on a large farm with relatives and close friends near by, Elizabeth became dear friends with a young girl named Victoria.  Upon Elizabeth's move to Maysville, Kentucky, in hopes of a more prosperous life for her family, Victoria and Elizabeth agreed they would write to one another and stay in touch over the years.  Victoria and Elizabeth had been raised with similar influences and therefore shared views on how their children should be raised.  Proper manners, religion, and an English education were a must.  As Elizabeth's children grew older, she had to take on the role of a teacher, and she strove to provide her children all the important amenities of a thorough English education. During the 1860s, when Elizabeth's eldest child was seven, the proper age to begin learning, she felt obligated to respond to the previously received letter from her dear Victoria, informing her of her lesion plans and the current \"mania for teaching\" they were experiencing in Kentucky.","  In the 1860s Families were advertising the importance of  sending children South for their \"board\" and/or education.  Elizabeth reminded Victoria, in her June 30, 1860 letter, \"that in the South our children could learn all the branches of a thorough English education.\"  In the eyes of Elizabeth and her fellow neighbors pushing this \"mania for teaching,\" an English education consisted of lessons in Greek, Latin, mathematics, French, German, music, singing, and painting. Elizabeth loved to teach and was anxious to begin teaching her two youngest children; one was not quite six and the other was two years old.  Elizabeth, however, did not like to begin teaching children until they were at least seven, so she must wait a few more years still. ","Nineteenth-century American society responded to the uncertainties of change through the idiom of gender.  In the early 1800s American found reassurance in widely shared perceptions of manhood and womanhood. According to historian Jeanne Boydston,  \"in the tenets of manhood were the promises of an orderly political life, and economic stability, and of the material welfare of the family.  The perceptions of womanhood, on the other hand, promised private morality and sentiment and the coherent transmission of culture from parent to child.\"  This \"republican\" system of polarities was a comforting way of conceiving secular society. As the principals of republicanism rose in importance, American society increasingly came to support the idea that women needed to understand clearly and embrace these values because they were responsible for passing them on to their children.  Women were fully responsible for teaching children but values and academic subjects that were not learned from helping their fathers around the farm.

Two white male adults, presumably acting as professors, stood before the African-American student body.

Bacon, a writer for \"The Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery\" published a statistical pamphlet in 1859 reflecting African American advancements in the nation's first capital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He acquired the statistics by examining the number of blacks associated with particular institutions. Bacon hoped to illustrate his belief that African Americans, just like white men, women, and children could enjoy the rewards of economic progress if given the opportunities of every citizen. The introduction of the new liberties and opportunities provided a chance for growth among the members of the black population in a time which faced great segregation and racism. ","The overall culture of Philadelphia in the 1830s through the 1850s rewarded many blacks who witnessed a new era of political ideology. During this time the city established new liberties such as access to a variety of schools for their children, decreased numbers in convicted persons, and also increased opportunities in mechanical trades. The new possibilities provided a foundation for greater achievement and acceptance into the dominant white culture that encompassed the United States. ","African American children received new opportunities to attend public, private, and reformatory schools. The schools had been refurbished to provide an improved atmosphere for learning. The education efforts afforded to many of the African American students is undeniably associated with Protestant reform. Perhaps one of the most prominent schools for black children was the House of Refuge for Colored Children, established in Philadelphia in 1850. Walter Trattner, a twentieth century scholar, expressed the popular opinion shared by many whites in the North during this time period: \"…in an attempt to cope with the disturbing social and economic conditions and to restore a sense of community to urban America, moralism succeeded benevolence, public aid and private charity were transformed into mechanisms for social control\". The foundation of this school allowed young African American inmates to move out of prison and into reform schools.","The level of tension between races may also be witnessed within the labor market. In 1838, the number of occupations made available to African Americans spanned across 134 categories in Philadelphia. In these categories, 997 consisted of African American workers. Historian Cecil Frey pointed out that in the late eighteenth century the slaves and free men were encouraged to participate in mechanical trades which increased competition between black and white communities. The encouragement did not last long, and according to Benjamin Bacon a majority of the workers within the trades were forced to desert their trades because of increased racial prejudice throughout the city. Few exceptions existed in this community; James Forten, being one of them, was still given boundaries to stand within regards to his 'natural' status. ","The most significant numbers revealed within the pamphlet seem to portray an ambivalent step towards leniency in African American sentencing. The proportion of white men versus African American men in the Philadelphia county prison switched from an equal level in 1835 to almost three white men to one black man in 1858. Willliam J. Mullen, a prison agent, stated within the pamphlet, \"To myself it seems the above list shows the conditions, moral, and civil, of the colored race, to have greatly improved within the last 23 years, and to be far higher at this moment than it was at the commencement of that period.\" At quick glance this assumption seems to be true, but as mentioned previously, the decline in number of African Americans in prison can also be attributed to the opening of the House of Refuge for Colored Children, which took the children out of prison and put them into reform school."],"display_date":"1835 - 1839","search_date":"1837-07-01","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4080,"title":"Speaking from Medicine Lodge:  Two Native American Opinions on Removal, White Culture, and Government Relations","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-10-19","end_date":"1867-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The Treaty of Medicine Lodge is among the last, most famous and most influential of the United States-Native American treaties.  The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it.

Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.

Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4084,"title":"The University in Wars Wake\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-07","end_date":"1865-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As John Minor, an esteemed law professor, sat in his office at the University of Virginia, he penned a letter to his sister in Galveston, Texas explaining the \"unparalleled losses\" suffered by Virginia.

Minor estimated the total losses in Virginia at \"little short of 400 million\" noting that enrollment at the University plummeted during the war, making it barely profitable for him to teach the few remaining students.

Although Charley, a cherished family member, died in battle, his memory served a significant purpose for the future of the South.  Memories attributed to the war in the south became known as the 'Lost Cause' rhetoric.  Men, like Charley, were memorialized as brave fighters, who, although they lost, fought honorably for a cause they believed in.  Women, like Mary and Lizzie, were memorialized as strong and willing to support their men as well as their country.  In creating memories of the war, women across the country helped to establish Decoration Days, which became Memorial Day, now a national holiday.  Confederate and Union veterans came together to commemorate anniversaries of battle and to reminisce on the camaraderie gained by the fight.

Embury emphasized that intellectual women were \"enough to convince any unprejudiced mind that heaven has conferred upon woman, no less than upon man, the gifts of talent and genius.\" She proclaimed that men and women were equally capable and that increasing the education of women was of utmost importance. Embury declared, \"A good education includes the culture of the heart as well as the mind.\" Individuals should be well-rounded, capable, intelligent citizens. Therefore, early childhood education was extremely important. Since mothers generally did most of the nurturing, Embury said, the education of women was extremely beneficial for society. ","Embury was not the only person to promote education for women in the United States. Female seminaries began to develop between 1820 and 1850. By 1850, there were 6,085 academies and seminaries in America. A large percentage of these were co-educational or open exclusively to women. Schools continued to open and expand their curriculums. Many educational reformers believed that such schools would not only provide women with a large knowledge base, but also \"prepared [them] for their important duties as virtuous wives.\" They felt that women would be better prepared to nurture their children and \"uplift the moral character of their sons and husbands\" if they were well-educated.

She said that it was good to have women learn their domestic duties, but it was not enough.  A woman must learn morals and have mental capacity in order to interact with other people, and mothers who teach their daughters, teach the opposite because they have not learned morals and social mentality themselves.  Hale was against frivolous things, like coming out parties to increase the quality of young women's education.  In her speech, she stressed that mothers are the best teachers, though, and that they should oversee their daughters' education.  Women were encouraged to get an education in order to provide for their families, if needs arose.

These families had to plan what they must do to get these young women prepared to fend for themselves.  Some of these young women had to get an education to help provide for their family.  Mount Holyoke and Wheaton advertised for these middle class families who had low income.  Domestic learning was also important to these two schools.  Mount Holyoke had a \"Domestic Plan,\" under which students did their own chores, like washing, cleaning, and cooking, and Wheaton had weekly inspections of students' dorms.  Domestic learning was not the most important thing to these colleges.  They had courses like drawing, music, arithmetic and philosophy, classes that were unheard of in traditional women's education.

The young woman was surrounded by \"tokens of wealth\" but she wished for something different. While her mother's spirit looked down over her she wanted more than just to enjoy the festivities of life and have a good husband and marriage. \"She had seemed to be happy, and had been envied by her friends: it was only in the quiet hours, when she was alone, that she cried out for more that she could gain in her present life.\" The young woman was unsatisfied and felt a sense of rebellion grow within her.

American society expected women to fill the roles of wives and mothers during this time, however many women asked themselves whether this was what they truly wanted to do with their lives. Historians like Charlene Boyer Lewis, have examined the lives of American women like Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte who stated, \"that with her disposition and character she never could have vegetated as the wife of some respectable man in business 'since nature never intended me for a life of obscurity.'\" Many white women wanted to pursue alternative gender roles but for most family pressures or lack of opportunity and resources led women to be wives and mothers, who had to dream in silence.  However, for young women of the mid to late nineteenth century female seminaries provided a place for women to expand their horizons as Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz explains in her book, Alma Mater. \"By 1859, sixty Mount Holyoke graduates had entered foreign missionary work\" is one example of the opportunities seminary women had just out of school.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4148,"title":"Recognizing the Importance of Female Education\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-10","end_date":"1831-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"Let me not be misunderstood, when I thus earnestly insist upon the necessity of female education,\" insisted Emma C.

Slowly, after much debate, the views on the education of females began to shift. Eventually a women's education was seen as being necessary in order for them to properly carry out their obligations as both a mother and wife. They believed that if a woman did not obtain appropriate knowledge, how could she impart proper wisdom upon her children?

The sight was fantastic, with clouds of smoke forming overhead, and the audience, as much as it tried, could not avert its eyes.  Soon, all evacuated and retreated back from where they had come.

She further maintained that it was more advantageous to observe events and their outcomes from a distance, in the country, before experiencing them first hand than \"to have lived in the very whirl of constantly occurring events\" (in the city).  The author also explained there was no greater teacher than nature.  In the country, one had the benefit of observing the harmony and lessons of nature.","     Women's seminaries used more than books to educate their students.  The idea of using the natural environment as a tool for education was stemmed from the work of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, the father of modern educational theory, and his assistant, Joseph Neef.  They felt that first hand knowledge would be more beneficial than learning strictly through books.  According to historian Gerald Lee Gutek, these men thought that \"natural instincts and interests should control, close contact with nature should furnish the occasion and means of education.\"  Where the school was located was equally important.  Schools like Mount Holyoke, Wellesley, and Wheaton, were located in ideal areas where students could study under the trees, learn about the stars through their observatories, and look at the beautiful landscape of the seminary.  Though city schools were supposed to provide cultural and social opportunities, students at Radcliff were unable to take advantage of the Cambridge society.  As historian Helen Horowitz has noted, one commentator asked rhetorically, \"Do the Annex girls enjoy the advantages of Cambridge society?...No; partly because the students are working women without leisure for frequent engagements; partly because Cambridge society is busy and absorbed and does not go out of its way to offer the Annex social culture.\"  "],"display_date":"June 1860","search_date":"1860-06-15","locations":[{"id":6122,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":3,"school_id":2}},{"id":4170,"title":" Seventh day festivities\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-03","end_date":"1859-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 3 1859, Francis Kemble noted in her diary the death of one of her neighbors and subsequent partition of his estate.

The slaves were brought to Savannah in small convenient groups. \"Half a Negro stock on major butlers plantation, fell to one of the 2 heirs of that estate\" Kembles noted. Also, the slaves were given a full body examination in preparation for the auctioning held on their seventh day in captivity. Slaves had experienced their mouths being pulled; and limbs pinched, to test their muscle structure. ",". Joseph Bryan was a slave broker who managed the sale of the slaves on the auction block. It was Bryan's job to keep the slaves fed, housed, and healthy up until the day of the auctioning. Slaves were placed in cages before they were sold. The floors that the slaves slept and ate on were bare and cold. The clothing they received during this transition phase was minimal and uncouth. The children were more carefully dressed and cared for than adults. The examinations slaves went through were to test their abilities and give their future masters insight into their productivity levels. As historian Walter Johnson has demonstrated, these rituals were common in the larger more prominent slave pens of late antebellum New Orleans.

William Gilmore Simms, editor of <em>War Poetry</em> found these pieces \"essential to the reputation of the Southern people\" as the words illustrated sentiments and ideas that influenced their actions (v).  Many of the poems featured in <em>War Poetry </em>become battle hymns, tell the stories of women left behind, tell of battles and victories, honor those who died, and most importantly persuade more soldiers to fight.  \"Carolina\" calls to the young men \"of the hill, wake swamp and river, coast and rill, rouse all thy strength and all thy skill\" to defeat the despot, the tyrant, the Huns, the North.  In the winter of 1862, when Timrod wrote \"Carolina\", the war had only begun and young men still believed in victory for the South.

The article explains that the reasoning behind the author in the <em>News</em> editorial was that the \"'more intelligent and reasonable citizens must rule'\" no matter whether they are the majority or not and that suppressing the Negro vote was the only way to ensure this. The problem the <em>News</em> editorial author saw was that the current method of violence and intimidation seemed to violate the law and went against the sentiments of many people both in the state of South Carolina and outside it. Moreover, the current method was inconsistent in its effects, whereas an indoctrinated system would be much more systematized and effective. ","The concepts expressed in the News article were a precursor to future action by southern states. In 1890 Mississippi enacted laws such as literacy tests as a method of \"legal\" disenfranchisement, and as the <em>News</em> article predicted these laws worked amazingly well. They were so effective, in fact, that by 1900 all but four southern states had enacted some form of literacy tests and in those states that had them the black vote was all but extinct. The reason these literacy tests worked so well on the black population was that most slaves had never been taught to read or write and only some progress had been made in educating them after Emancipation. ","The successful imposition of these literacy tests was due in part to the fact that there was wide support for them across the country. The author of the New York Times article, in fact, voiced his support for literacy tests as \"a simple and natural method by which a community can protect itself against serious abuse and dangers.\" The problem the author saw was that these laws would not be administered equally or impartially and were simply a tool for suppressing the black vote. Under this premise \"an educational test becomes merely an instrumentality of wrong and fraud\" and so cannot be tolerated because it interferes with the democratic process. ","One must conclude in reading this article that Northern politicians were well aware of Southern intentions to disenfranchise blacks using legal tools long before they were ever able to enact them. The question is why did they let them? Part of the reason lies in the fact that the Democratic Party returned to national dominance in the mid 1880s and undid much of the Reconstruction legislation meant to ensure black rights. But Richard Valelly in his book <em>The Two Reconstructions</em> argues that it was also the fact that the Republican Party lost interest in the black community as a political group. As he states, \"The enormous and rapid growth of the Republican Party in the late 1890s outside the South substituted for lost black voters at the margin.\" So despite the fact that Republicans in the North knew that Southerners sought legal means to disenfranchise blacks they lacked the legal power and political interest to do anything about it."],"display_date":"February 7, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-07","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4271,"title":"Furman Promises Appropriate Education for Women\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-08-01","end_date":"1850-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["       Reverend James C.

He addressed the crowd of students with the words, \"women's sphere lies within the limits of private life. Home is the true scene of her influence.\"  He stressed the meaning of women as mothers, mistresses, advisors, physicians, judges, and educators.  James Furman advised the women of the college to take full advantage of their education at the seminary in order to become better mothers for the future generation. He also, mentioned his fears of women in the public sphere of a man's world.  He believed women did not belong in places like an autonomy class or the rough atmosphere of poll boxes around voting time.  Religion was applied generously to the advice he gave women on their duties. He challenged women to use the Bible as, \"the true Lady's Book,\" to maintain virtue and honesty, instead of finding merit in aesthetic assets, like beauty and the comforts of luxury.  James encouraged the students to \"cultivate habits of neatness and order,\" so that it would better the skill sets they would require for God's design.  He finished his speech by reminding the young woman of the seminary to use the influence of a woman to demonstrate the goodness of God and to set Christian examples for their future husbands. ","        James C. Furman's address to the students of Johnson Female Seminary indicated the view of women in the mid-nineteenth century as a companion to men and a devoted mother.  J.M.C. Breaker, another minister in the neighboring county of Greenville agreed, when he addressed the domesticity of the home and the role of women as \"angels of mercy\" in his speech for the Greenville Baptist Female College in 1858. Christianity provided the foundations of this concept as the secular world became a place for men to leave the home and pursue occupations separate from home life.  Women were to carry the ideology of goodness, purity, and the humanity of men, by their behavior in private and public life.  ","      When Furman mentions the Bible as a \"lady's book\" he is associating God's word to a lady's journal.  Popular in the day, women's magazines were used to demonstrate correct manners, give advice on child rearing, and to guide women through their daily chores as caretaker and submissive companions.  Lady's journals, like <em>Godey's Lady Book</em> provided women with stories of romance and duty, much like the bible would provide the spiritual guidance women needed.  Rev. Furman implies that even though beauty and dress is important, the basic values of goodness are better.","      In the speech, Furman states that he would be shocked to discover a woman in a classroom or in any realm of public life.  A year earlier, in 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to graduate from medical school.  By August in 1850, several revolutionary women had taken steps to improve education and missionary work.  Public opinion circulating during this time deemed the pursuit of a career by a woman was an act of aggression. Intellectual training was ill suited for the poor, frail mental and physical design of a woman.  ","      Even though, the aim of altering women's education toward better intellectual standards was slowly evolving in the United States, the students of Johnson Female Seminary were being groomed for the life of a plantaintion mistress.   James C. Furman's speech is an example of the nineteenth century values that restricted women's right toward higher means of learning.  Action came though, in the next ten years women's colleges and seminaries would instruct female students as teachers.

The work also coincided with an outline for a female educational institution near Columbia, South Carolina.  Marks' goal was to create a school that prepared women for their role in society as wives and mothers, whose duty it was to educate their children on values and morals.  ","In his report, Marks conveys his own ideas about the place of women in society, and he believed that place was at the head of the household.  In order for women to reach their potential in these roles, Marks stressed the importance of cultivation of the mind through education.  He believed that parents were the source of morality and virtue for their children, and in order to raise children with upstanding morals, it was important to educate young women through virtuous instruction.  Marks pointed out that, as a mother, \"How many principles of right and wrong to inculcate and point out; how many maxims of wisdom to exemplify; how many prejudices to remove; how many obscurities and apparent contradictions, to unravel and explain; how much infantine cunning, sophistry, and casuistry to detect; and how necessary is it, in all these, that her own actions should illustrate the principles which she advances.\"  Marks saw education as necessary to instill in women virtue and piety, so that in turn, women could educate their own families on the same ideas.  Women were educated, not for their own benefit, but for the purpose of raising more virtuous children who would become admirable citizens in society.  ","Margaret Nash notes that in the 1820s, literature began to split the world into two different spheres - one for males, and one for females.  The female worldview became known as the \"cult of domesticity,\" meaning that the literature assigned women to the roles of the home, and also associated values of piety and morality with them.  Women of that time had only limited occupational opportunities, but, faced with unstable economic conditions, women had to prepare themselves to provide for a family on their own.  In response, women began seeking education that not only provided them with the knowledge of how to run a home, but also afforded them the necessary knowledge to find and keep a job.  Excluded from most colleges and universities, women turned to educational institutions such as seminaries, academies, and high schools.  These schools provided women with an education very similar to the education men received at the college level, and gave them an opportunity to obtain jobs, provide for themselves, and not be completely reliant on men to provide for their needs.

Sullivan arrived in Prince Edward County, Virginia with the intention to open a free school system for all students regardless of race. However, his efforts were not made easy by any means because of the strong opposition to integration of the white people in the county and the state of Virginia in general. Almost all of the county's 1700 black students missed five years of their education between 1959 and 1964 as the school board shut down the public school system. On his first night in town in August, 1963, he opened his mailbox to find letters telling him to \"pack his Yankee bag and start traveling\", and that the \"Prince Edward Negroes were 'their' Negroes and that he should leave them alone\". Dr. Neil V. Sullivan continued his efforts to start a school to ensure that all students would be guaranteed an education. Even amongst receiving threatening phone calls every day and people shooting at his car, Dr. Sullivan made sure his schools were open for the students every day.","The effort to create a free school system for both white and black citizens in Prince Edward  County began in 1959 with the efforts of the NAACP, but it was not until President Kennedy created an initiative to open schools in 1963 that such a school system exsisted. After receiving a petition signed by 695 citizens of the county demanding public education for all students, he created the initiative to start the Prince Edward Free Schools Association. This one year project would be headed by Superintendent Dr. Sullivan. 1600 black students and a handful of whites enrolled in the free schools. There was minimal community backlash against these schools; in fact, <em>The Farmville Herald</em>, known for its segregationalist viewpoints and conservative manner, ran an ad for the Free Schools in the weeks prior to its opening. On May 25th, 1964, only nine months after the Free Schools project had begun, the Supreme Court decided that the Prince Edward County Board of Supervisors had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying students of color the right to a free and public education. Public schools were officially integrated and reopened in the fall of 1964.","Opposition towards integration after the <em>Brown v Board</em> decision of 1954 in Prince Edward County, Virginia remained strong even ten years later.

The white opposition was represented in Prince Edward by the leadership of <em>The Farmville Herald</em>, the local newspaper. This twice weekly newspaper and its editor, J.

Dillard, the Charlottesville philanthropist affiliated with the efforts to fund and improve black education in America, Dr. Carter G. Woodson wrote of a recent loss of staff on the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History due to the efforts of Anson Phelps Stokes, Thomas Jesse Jones and others.  Considered by Woodson as the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia,\" Stokes and Jones, among others played the role of conspirators against the Association's production of the \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in Woodson's depiction.  Dr. Woodson claimed that these men, \"devoted to Negro control,\" were responsible for stealing his former employee and recruiting him to destroy the efforts of the Association.  Woodson wrote, \"they hope to divide the Negroes in their attitude toward what we are doing.\"  With this letter, he hoped to gauge Dillard's stance on the issue and push him to choose a group to support.","            The first battle in this outright publishing war actually occurred a few years earlier, when the April 27, 1931 Phelps Stokes Fund meeting spawned the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro\" project.  The announcement of this Stokes-Jones supported encyclopedia hit Woodson hard, who had been working on his own encyclopedia of the same subject matter for a decade by that time.  It also spurred Woodson to engage in public battles with these two men and their associates in interviews and through correspondence, like the letter he sent to Dr. Dillard.  After having already announced the work of the Association to compile and publish an \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in 1921, Woodson believed that Stokes and Jones aimed to publish a story of the Negro \"as the white man wants and is willing to pay for.\"  For Woodson, the duplication of a work that his organization had already compiled extensive data for proved that the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia\" acted as enemies of blacks in America and not friends.  He addressed this idea in earlier correspondence with the council overseeing the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro.\"  In a 1932 letter, he asked the promoters of the encyclopedia either to furnish his association with a small sum of money to finish their own work or to use their funds to fix other problems facing the black American.  Woodson also suggested the appointment of an officer from the Stokes-Jones council to review the efforts of both sides and assess the inventory and progress of each project.  The Stokes-Jones camp declined to adapt either suggestion to the activities of their fund and the battle waged on throughout the years.","            Carter G. Woodson believed that the education of blacks needed changes to reverse the effects of a black inferiority complex.  Woodson wanted an organic education for blacks that came out of their history and experiences, and not from outside influences.  This desire for truth and authority in retelling the story of the black American to the world guided Woodson's scholarly endeavors.  This same desire pushed him to question the motives of Stokes and Jones, as well as their associates.  Believing education steeped in the black experience and the \"true\" history of the race to be crucial to the development of the black American, Woodson could not reconcile the white leadership of the Stokes-Jones project with their supposed aims of providing blacks with a document for their race.  According to Woodson, \"Negroes must be led to solve their own problems and thus carve out their own future,\" and if the promoters of the Encyclopedia of the Negro declined to aid this plan, then they proved themselves as negative influences on the movement to improve black education.  Carter G. Woodson wanted to help blacks help themselves by providing them with their own history and achievements to share with the world.  The \"Encyclopedia Africana\" represented an outlet to provide that scientific and historical information for people, and to Woodson, other efforts towards creating a similar work that ignored his aims lacked authority and validity.","Citatio"],"display_date":"April 27, 1931 - December 23, 1936","search_date":"1934-02-23","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":61,"tag":"encyclopedia"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Race and Politics of Reconciliation","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":19,"school_id":1}},{"id":4573,"title":"Reverend Aughey On Poor White Education in the South","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-03-24","end_date":"1863-03-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An extract of Reverend J.H.

Police stood by as crowd control when the marchers, joined by local politicians, gathered in Marine Park.  The march, sponsored by the local Home and School Association, coincided with a boycott of schools “that cut school attendance in half.”  The permit for the demonstration specified that protestors were not allowed to march to schools.  Protestors, nearly 5,000 in number,  represented a mixture of ages, mostly young to middle-aged and carried signs with slogans “with racial undercurrents.”","Boston schools faced many problems with desegregation.  Desegregation in the North was harder in many ways because the segregation was de facto.  White residents in these areas felt that busing hurt neighborhood schools.

The year before the South passed the North in integration of schools and the North’s integration record continued to decline in the 1960s.  The question facing Americans was whether the busing plans would overcome the opposition.  Some cities moved forward with the forced integration via busing, but other cities fought back.  Opposition ranged from legal appeals to violence.  President Nixon held a strong anti-busing stance and instructed the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to “work with individual school districts to hold busing to the minimum required by law.”  Some felt that his opposition caused more problems.","The New York Times examined specific cases to see how desegregation was taking place.  In Houston, Texas, Nixon intervened with citywide busing and “asked the Justice Department to appeal the ruling.”  Denver, Colorado’s opposition won in their court case and went on to consider other plans.  San Francisco, California saw “heckling and fist fights” at meetings discussing busing.  They experienced large opposition from Chinese-Americans, as well as conservative whites.  The assistant chief of the Office of Intergroup Relations for the California Department of Education, Ted Neff, felt that “Racial and ethnic isolation is increasing.”  Wichita, Kansas, under pressure to integrate, chose to integrate according to the “city’s racial make-up”.  Pontiac, Michigan appealed a court order to start busing in the fall failed and   ten buses were firebombed as school was beginning that year.  The Seattle, Washington school board attempted to implement a citywide busing plan, but was stopped by a court order.  Rochester, New York began busing voluntarily, while Providence, Rhode Island was in it’s third stage of desegregation, there were still strong objections seen here.  Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth, of Minnesota, underwent partial integration.  The states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts sternly enforced busing, particularly in major cities.  Harrisburg, Pennsylvania began a busing program in 1970 “based on the students’ racial and economic background.” Pittsburgh and Philadelphia appealed the order.  “Richardson Dilworth, president of the Philadelphia school board and former Mayor, said, ‘The white population of this city would never permit the kind of massive cross-busing the order would require, nor would the City Council or the state legislature appropriate the money’” The Massachusetts Board of Education chose to deny $21.3 million dollars in funding from Boston, because of their unwillingness to comply with the busing program.","These events coincided with, and in some cases were a reaction to, the influential court case of <em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education </em>(1971)<em>. </em>This stated that because racial integration is so important, busing could be used, if necessary.  Opponents to busing, like the cities mentioned in the article, felt busing interfered with their community.  Although Nixon campaigned on a strict anti-busing stance, he was not able to stop the busing programs from moving forward.  Americans feared that the same type of violence which was seen in the desegregation of the Southern schools would be seen in the North."],"display_date":"August 13, 1971","search_date":"1971-08-13","locations":[{"id":35299,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"Harris, Texas"},{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":36548,"lat":37.6847870045,"lng":-97.4611031528,"zoom":9,"place":"Sedgwick, Kansas"},{"id":36895,"lat":42.6604396043,"lng":-83.3855274047,"zoom":9,"place":"Oakland, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4820,"title":"<strong>Women Entering the Business Sphere: Analyzes The Washington Post article, \"Women in Business\" in comparison to Shelley's, Learning to Stand and Speak.</strong>","course_id":41,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-01-01","end_date":"1881-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the late 18<sup>th</sup> to early 19<sup>th</sup> century, women began to explore their intellectual talents outside of the education field. <em>The Washington Post</em> (1877-1954) published an article titled <em>Women in Business</em>, expressing the purpose of the exhibit mounted by the League of Business and Professional Women. The goal was to help others, specifically women, appreciate their business skills and embark in professional careers. Though many women were reluctant of this new initiative to help motivate women into entering the business world, for many, the exhibit worked as a reminder that they can succeed. During this time there was major controversy surrounding the issue of women taking on professional roles outside of the home. On the other hand, many exhibitors believed that this was only the beginning to a great balance between the social and domestic power of women.  By entering the business sphere, women were becoming more thrifty housekeepers, enhancing their role as mother’s and wives. The idea that women <em>can</em> fulfill her duties within the home, while still maintaining her experiences in business, proved to society that women could actually “do it all.”","In the book, <em>Learning to Stand and Speak</em>, by Mary Kelley, she focuses on the “big picture” between the relationship of women and education. The piece reflects on womens entrance into education and their external influences in achieving teaching careers. Though this might have been seen as a positive shift towards gender equality, in reality, women were still given many limitations; their futures were pre-destined even upon entering college. The women seminaries considered that education would be for the women’s own good, preparing them as intellectuals. While this was a step forward in women’s rights, this was only useful for the intellectual advancement of <em>white </em>women during that era. <em>African American</em> women were not participating in the usage of such educational resources. Rather, they were excluded for reasons of not “belonging” to a certain class or race. The seminaries were structured from the curriculum males followed, though it did not serve justice for the women. The all women seminaries began to take shape during the early 1980’s, when more classes were being offered within the science and language field (specifically Latin).","When thinking about the role of female educational institutions during these times, women were asking questions such as, <em>what subjects will the seminaries cover? What are the career objectives for the women who attend such institutions?</em> Rather than expanding the career opportunities for women, these seminaries, though preparing women for civil society, created barriers between women and the professional world. As the first reading suggested, exhibits such as the one created by the League of Business and Professional Women, encouraged women to follow the business path. Meanwhile, the seminaries were not providing such opportunities for all women. The real question lies whether <em>all</em> women, regardless of race or class-status, were receiving a <em>fair</em> education. Whether these seminaries actually prepared women for the “real world”, having the intellectual and skillful organization to compete with other men. While education was key for success, a more valuable education prepared individuals for all aspects of real-world situations. The home is where the women’s heart lies, but not for the purpose of secluding them from other vocational goals."],"display_date":"1880 - 1881","search_date":"1880-12-31","locations":[{"id":6212,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":10,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":426,"tag":"Careers"},{"id":425,"tag":"Business"},{"id":424,"tag":"Washington Post"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":37,"tag":"House"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":41,"school_id":2}},{"id":4858,"title":"Zora Neale Hurston: Improving Race Relations through African Folklore","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"6/8/32","end_date":"10/10/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zora Neale Hurston made contributions to the acceptance of African Americans in society through her noteworthy folklore writing.  Hurston was an inhabitant of Florida, but resided in New York City when she wrote a letter to Professor Grover on June 8<sup>th</sup> 1932.[1]  In her letter, she explains that she majored in Anthropology at Columbia University.  Furthermore, she states “I have done three years research among my people and possibly I know as much about the matter as anyone else.”[2]  The overall point of Hurston’s letter to Professor Grover was a request to give a concert of Negro folklore to accurately represent African life.  Zora Neale Hurston had notable success in the North, but it would be an arduous task to raise awareness of African life and improve race relations in the South due to discrimination.","Hamilton Holt, president of Rollins College at the time wrote a letter to William Robert Wunsch an English instructor at Rollins College on November 1 1932.  In the letter, Hamilton Holt explains, “I see no reason why you should not put on in recreation hall the negro folk evening under the inspiration of Zora Hurston.”[3]  Holt indicates he does not want anything vulgar in the presentation.  Also, he makes note there should be no Negroes in the audience unless they are segregated, but still believes that would be unwise.[4]  Later in the letter, Hamilton Holt does not recommend advertising the event, but also claims he might be wrong by not advertising Zora Neale Hurston’s work.[5]  The negativity of some of Holt’s letter to Wunsch may seem misleading.  In reality, Hamilton Holt was eventually honored by the presence of Zora Neale Hurston on campus.[6]  It seemed clear he was just taking precaution of the radical change of having an African American at Rollins College due to the discrepancy between the perceived acceptance of blacks in the North and the South.  In fact, Hamilton Holt ended his letter to Wunsch stating, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”[7]  The direction Holt is referring to portrays better race relations between blacks and whites, and equality","Through the writing of the president of Rollins College in the 1930s, Hamilton Holt not only accepted but also embraced Hurston’s request.[8]  Hamilton Holt wrote, “I was very proud that Mr. Wunsch, Dr. Gover, and the others helped you, and Rollins will always be glad that we had some part in your success.”[9]  This quote alludes to the fact that highly educated African Americans are being accepted and embraced in the South and North, thus representing an improvement in race relations.  Holt goes on to compliment Hurston’s work, and show his support by suggesting Rollins will do everything in the college’s power to improve her success and happiness.[10]","Part of Zora Neale Hurston’s acknowledgement as an accepted member of society instead of just a black woman can partially be attributed to her experience at Rollins College.  Zora Neale Hurston became an extremely accomplished folklore writer, but more than that she was an incredibly productive member of African American society.  Through Hurston’s work and optimism, she enlightened whites of African culture, which ultimately proved an African American was being accepted in the populace through different regions of the United States."],"display_date":"June 8, 1932 -

African Americans in the early twentieth century faced poverty, joblessness, poor housing, unequal justice, inadequate health care and the denial of full civic participation. Suffrage restrictions, schools that were unequally funded, and a culture of white progressivism that hypocritically assigned a stigma of inferiority to blacks defined the existence of most African Americans through many years.  Even in the North, African Americans were discriminated against in the universities and colleges; therefore, African Americans wanted provisions to educate their people and to have the same rights to education as white individuals.  Leaders like John L Godwin, responding to the developments in the state and national government, sought to make the concessions to have equal education for African Americans available to create an appropriate climate for growth.  Reverend Kirton, who participated in a discussion for the erection on schools for African Americans, stated: “the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has never solved the problem of human relations.  We can solve our problems together, but any other way there will be tensions and trouble because we can’t understand each other.  What is needed most here is to make all citizens, both Negro and White to feel they are the family of New Hanover County.  All problems can be solved in the spirit of brotherly love.  You can’t ignore them or leave them for our children.”","William Edward Burghardt DuBois was a renowned educator; he believed that ignorance was a cure for nothing. Therefore, W.E.B. Dubois developed ideas about an optimal education for African Americans during a critical stage in the struggle for equality.  There were many others who agreed that educating African Americans was necessary to the uplift and development of the race. Fisk University, a four-year black institution was established to train leaders to “uplift their race.” The neighborhoods surrounding Fisk were home to black Southerners removed from slavery.   Tuskegee University became another victorious accomplishment in the development of African American schools, when George Campbell, Booker T. Washington and Lewis Adams (African Americans) gained control of the school from the state of Alabama. Hampton University, an historically black university, was another dynamic, progressive institution of higher education. One of the areas uppermost in the minds of many blacks, especially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was education.","If the history of educational attainment were a barometer for the advancement of African Americans, the results would probably be mixed.  The Civil War ended slavery, but African Americans were promised nothing, and they realized this.  As African Americans fought for political, social and economic power they constantly questioned the meaning of freedom.

Dr. Jones, the college president was the first to discover the students and speak with them. According to Dr. Jones, the students were peaceful, and no damage had been done to any school property. The takeover did interrupt the routine school schedule: the administration building had been taken over on Wednesday night, and on Thursday teachers reported to work to find few if any students in the classroom.","The students circulated a four page list of grievances signed by the “dissatisfied student body.” They urged administrators to solve the problem of apathy and prejudice among faculty and instructors with improved hiring practices and better teachers. The students wanted administration to seek more state funds, as well as add courses in African American History and a basic curriculum in black awareness, including a course in economic problems of black Americans. The list also included longer library hours and lower text book costs, with better service at the bookstore and the post office. Another demand was a full time worker in the infirmary and better cafeteria conditions, including more sanitary practices by employees, better, and pest extermination. Dr. Jones talked with the leaders of the group and was hopeful a solution could be arranged. This is the second protest at Fayetteville State; in 1966 students held a demonstration with grievances similar to these. A similar demonstration was held at Virginia Union in Richmond the same week; the students there had fifty-two grievances. Richard Mclntire, the author of<em> Impacting Change, </em>explains in his article that students were a major part of the success of the civil rights movement. Mclntire explains how a small group of students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College started the Greensboro sit ins at Woolworths lunch counter. The sit ins got the attention of SCLC and Dr. Martin Luther King contacted students on several campuses and within weeks students in eleven cities held sit ins. Six months later the students that sat in at Woolworths lunch counter were served. SNCC was founded at Shaw University in North Carolina that was sponsored by the SCLC. Student volunteers were called freedom riders and they took bus trips into the south to test out the newly prohibited segregation laws.","The students at these lack luster universities were surrounded by protests and demonstrations by people demanding social equality, changes in policy, and other improvements. Naturally the students were compelled to conduct a demonstration of their own. The needs of the student body were very basic, and few could doubt that there should be sanitary practices in the café and a full time worker in the infirmary. The students should not have needed to encourage administration to get funding from the government because they should have been doing that anyway.

The article was addressed to the paper’s editor and criticized the lack of an adequate establishment for the education of young ladies in the town. The author argued that women’s education was necessary in order for women to better educate their children. Two months later, in March 1828, Elizabeth Ricord announced the opening of the Geneva Female Seminary. This seminary would be located in Geneva and would provide young women from the town, and from across the country, with the opportunity to receive an education.","These two events, the criticism of Geneva’s lack of female instruction and the opening of Ricord’s seminary, were typical of the time period because they reflected the growth of female schools that occurred in the United States between 1790 and 1850. These episodes also demonstrate the two contradicting arguments that both promoted the education of women. The first argument promoted women’s education on the grounds of Republican Motherhood, or the idea that women should be educated so they would be able to better educate their children to become Republican citizens. The author of <em>The Gazette</em> article demonstrated this ideal when he argued that, “since the most important part of that time in which the mind is to be formed and the inclinations properly directed, is almost exclusively passed under the government of females, the regular instruction of our daughters is an object of the first magnitude.” In contrast, some Americans also began to support women’s education because it brought them closer to equality with men. These advocates were influenced by the ideas of women’s rights supporter Mary Wollstonecraft who argued that women were not naturally inferior to men, but the lack of education they received created their inferiority. Ricord’s catalogue reflected Wollstonecraft’s ideas when it posed the question, “In the other sex, a well balanced mind is thought of inestimable value: why not in ours?” Despite their contradictory nature, these two views on why women should be educated contributed to the creation of numerous female schools across the United States and the expansion of women’s education."],"display_date":"January 16, 1828 - March 16, 1828","search_date":"1828-02-14","locations":[{"id":9088,"lat":43.2613440596,"lng":-76.9589722947,"zoom":9,"place":"SENECA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":539,"tag":"Women's Seminaries"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":552,"tag":"women's education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4974,"title":"The First Blacks","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/77","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The First Blacks","            In this country about thirty to fifty years ago racial segregation existed among blacks and whites in the education system. It was only in the 1950’s when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in the case of Brown v Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Yet, it was only about forty years ago when Rollins College began to accept African American applicants. In 1965 only white students attended Rollins, five years later twenty African American students attended Rollins.","            Troy Layng was a white graduate from Rollins in the late sixties. He returned to Rollins to shockingly find a change in the student body, African American students. Layng conducted several interviews among the black students, and astonished by the active roles they played at Rollins. Among the students were; Laurence Martinez, leading scorer on the Men Basketball team, Chapel reader, nominee of the 1969 edition of Outstanding College Athletes of America along with a number of other leadership roles on campus. Anita Thomas was a member of ; Rollins Players, Steering Committee, Community Action Board and was a discussion leader in the College Preparation Week. Layng also interviewed two other African American students that were proactive during their four years at Rollins. Layng asked a series of questions concerning the student body’s perception of African American students, the advantages and disadvantages of attending Rollins, the reason or reasons why they selected Rollins, racial issues they face among the student body and faculty, and etc.","            The initial interview question was “Why did you select Rollins?” two out of the four student response were similar, they both mentioned the nice atmosphere but at the same time they both were concerned with the amount of blacks students that attended Rollins. The other two answered in another tone, one was fairly confident in her academics throughout high school and was convinced that Rollins chose her instead. Unfortunately the last student did not have Rollins or any other College in his future plans until his guidance counselor introduced Rollins as the best school in the South. Motivation and self determination was established among these students, in their academics and active roles at Rollins.","            An interesting question that was asked was “What could Rollins do to attract a greater number of black students” each response included the concern of financial aid and scholarships, appealing courses to those of color, incorporate black board members in the Admission Department and a stronger communication and interaction between white and black students especially among black students themselves. But their main disquiet was forming a better understanding among the social cooperation of both white and black students. Another major concern of the students was how the white students perceived them. The students in the interview repeatedly mention the importance of cultural mergence.   The previous questions were the most interesting to the students, they actually seemed genuinely concerned with the future of African American scholars. On the last page of the document there was a list of African American students that attended Rollins. Originally, the name of the document was “Negro Undergraduates at Rollins” but “Negro” was crossed out and “Black” was written it its place. This symbolizes the improvement of racial awareness among the student body at Rollins. The list has the year of six semesters, names of the student and class status. Interestingly enough there were only one African American student form 1964-1965, but from 1969-1970 there was a significant leap from one to about African American students.  De-segregation in the South was a huge issue. Of course whites didn’t want Blacks to attend the same schools, or have equal rights. There was a lost “promise” among the African Americans. Whites were too afraid that the Blacks would take over and fight back. Ideally this happened, but of course the blacks had a tough time voicing their opinions. The Jim Crow laws were imposed on the African Americans.

Bishop John Henry Hobart born September 14, 1775, Hobart excelled in schooling from the early stages of his life, starting with his education at Episcopal Academy in Pennsylvania, and went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University. This high level of education prepared him to become a very influential citizen being in his lifetime, and inspired him to start a college of his own.","Bishop Hobart main goal for Geneva College was to make sure young people were educated no matter what social level they were on.  Hobart claimed that his college would be, “an Episcopal college in which those young person who have been nurtured in the bosom of the church, might enjoy the advantages of a liberal education… without endangering their religious principles.” Hobart’s goal in establishing Geneva College was to provide an education for the young generations, and to ensure that farmers, mechanics, manufacturers, and merchants were all able to receive a liberal education.","Hobart made many connections with people in society, Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, a New York Politician, William Duer, a lawyer from New York City, who both of supported Hobart’s overall purpose of designing a college, and the development that Hobart was building for Geneva College. Bowen, another one of Hobart’s friends stated, “I most earnestly hope and pray that our purpose of erecting the academy at Geneva into a College will be successful. I am daily more and more persuaded, that without the academical education of our youth in a greater degree retained in our hands, our theological seminary or seminaries will but little contribute to keep us from being neutralized & enfeebled into a miserable condition.” Hobart worked hard to communicate with the people he knew around him concerning the growth of Geneva College in addition to its education and overall structure.","John Henry Hobart felt that Geneva was superior to all other towns that surrounded it, and knew that with a robust town was necessary for a well-built college. Hobart argued, “if there is to be but one College in the Western district, undoubtedly Geneva had in every view superior claims to Ithaca.” Hobart thought of Geneva as a place that had reasonable control within a town, and with a strong education and powerful support and funding, people in young generations, and of all economical statuses would be able to create a thriving college that would become a respected institution."],"display_date":"February 14, 1821 - February 20, 1823","search_date":"1822-02-17","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":601,"tag":"Geneva College"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":605,"tag":"Upstate New York"},{"id":640,"tag":"Hobart College"},{"id":641,"tag":"Geneva"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4987,"title":"<strong>“The Graduation of Elizabeth Blackwell; A Triumph for the Autonomy of Women in Nineteenth- Century America” </strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-23","end_date":"1849-01-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 23, 1849 at the graduation ceremony at Geneva Medical College, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in America to receive a degree to practice medicine. The traditional commencement ceremony and distribution of diplomas was held in the college’s Presbyterian Church. Within the hour before the ceremony began the Church was filled to maximum capacity. The audience present at the ceremony, who witnessed the historical moment, consisted of family members and friends of members of the graduates, faculty members, residents of the city of Geneva, and the guest speakers. Historian Wendell Tripp notes a significant factor pertaining to the attendance on this day was the abundance of women present. One of these women, Miss Margaret Delancey, revealed the details she observed during the ceremony in a letter to her sister-in-law Josephine M. Delancey dated January 29, 1849. When Blackwell was called upon to receive her diploma, Delancey said she appeared both humbled and embarrassed by the enthusiastic applause of all present. In the Commencement speech given by Dr. Charles A. Lee, Delancey wrote that “he alluded in a dignified manner to the fact that one of the present class was female, complimented the sex generally and Miss. B in particular and told us that she was fully qualified to practise as a physician and that the degree was fully merited.” The reactions of the ordinary people who were present to witness such an extraordinary event, demonstrates the intrigue and interest that surrounded Blackwell, a woman, being the recipient of such recognition.","The ultimate historical significance of the Elizabeth Blackwell’s graduation from Geneva Medical College reflects the changing ideologies surrounding woman in the middle of the nineteenth- century specifically in the state of New York. Her graduation not only represented her accumulated struggle to be accepted despite her gender, but it also provided her with her ultimate power tool: a degree to practice medicine. Blackwell was able to pursue and enhance the health care available to women because as a woman she could explore many of the health issues that only applied to women. She served as an example for women during this time that they could pursue careers outside of the constraints that society placed on them both socially and physically."],"display_date":"January 23, 1849","search_date":"1849-01-23","locations":[{"id":8963,"lat":42.8528910026,"lng":-77.2997755076,"zoom":9,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":609,"tag":"Gender Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4989,"title":"<strong>Elizabeth Ricord Opens Female Seminary in Upstate New York </strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-05-01","end_date":"1829-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In May, 1829, the Geneva Female Seminary opened for its first school year with only about 15 students. It continued to grow and develop under the leadership of Elizabeth Ricord, the founder and principal of the school, and six years later, enrolled over 120 students. During the early American republic period, hundreds of female academies sprang up throughout the nation in both cities and the countryside, proving that these institutions were becoming an important part of American life. The growing opportunity to earn an education helped redefine the role of women as it gave them the knowledge and skills to participate in American civil society.","Ricord designed her academic courses to teach students how to think and reason. The school offered basic courses like spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, history, botany, philosophy, chemistry, algebra, geometry, rhetoric, and political economy. There was even a course specifically designed for preparing students for the “duties of society,” called Practical Knowledge. Ricord encouraged her students to “seek more lofty objects” and use their education in a constructive way. She also placed a special emphasis on religion and mental philosophy, as she was especially interested in these topics. Ricord and other teachers at the seminary believed it was very important for young women to develop strong morals. In fact, this was one of the main purposes for women to earn an education at Ricord’s seminary.","Ricord wrote there was an “uncommon degree of order, regularity, and moral rectitude” among the students. The laws of reason, conscience, and the Bible ruled the seminary. The middle-class women who graduated from these seminaries claimed to have “female moral superiority,” which influenced the way they engaged in civil society. Female seminaries during the early republic era helped cultivate the position of women as moral agents whose job was to raise virtuous children and teach them the ways of the Bible. After earning an education, many women became school teachers to fulfill this new role.","Female academies played a significant role in pushing women into the public sphere and helped them become active members in the developing civil society. Many of the women who graduated from these academies went on to become reformers and worked to help abolish slavery, to petition for women’s suffrage, to help feed the poor, and to combat men’s dominant role in politics.  The teachers in the female seminaries trained a new generation of women to be able to engage in politics and form individual opinions on local and national issues. Elizabeth Ricord’s commitment to educating women transformed the lives of her students and helped redefine the role of women in American society."," "],"display_date":"May 1829","search_date":"1829-05-16","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":642,"tag":"Civil Society"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":539,"tag":"Women's Seminaries"},{"id":552,"tag":"women's education"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4990,"title":"“Reverend Proudfit argues for the use of the Bible in Common Schools”","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-03-01","end_date":"1826-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Second Great Awakening, there were many religious figures who transformed the way the general population thought about religion and its social practices. Much of the new religious thought came from upstate New York from areas called “burned-over districts,” because of the frequency with which they experienced religious revivals, or transformative incidents, which changed a person’s religious outlook. One such person who was a transformative figure during this time was Reverend Alexander Proudfit, from Albany, who argued very vehemently for the use of the Bible in common, or primary schools. In a letter he sent to the Geneva General Advertiser, Proudfit attempted to justify the use of the Bible in primary schools by using educational grounds. He connected the literacy of the emerging American nation, with an emphasis on liberty and intelligence, to the moral and religious principles that were present in the Bible. Proudfit argued that “a nation the most illiterate, the most unprincipled and profligate; may be controlled by the iron arm of despotism. He tried to argue that the democratic values that were beginning to develop in America could be connected to the Bible, and this justified its use in common schools.","The connection that Proudfit made between democracy and religion was intriguing. The emerging Arminianism that was developing in Geneva influenced the Methodists that had founded a church there. Just by the fact that this religious was becoming a major factor in Geneva, and Arminianism was a sect that embraced education, Proudfit had targeted the right audience for his editorial, as the tradition that was being developed connected religion and education strongly.","The democratic values that the Methodists believed, which Proudfit argued were to be a result from the Bibles’ teachings, were part of the reason of the increase in free will and freedom of ideas during this time. The movement of ideas helped to spur intellectual social movements that would change society during time. Additionally, the increase in political action during this time was partially caused by the free flow of ideas that these religious revivals helped to produce."],"display_date":"March 1, 1826","search_date":"1826-03-01","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":5002,"title":"<strong>Symbolizing So Much More than Literary Achievement</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-01-01","end_date":"1884-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A decoration that celebrates achievement in the literary and historical realms, “Polished after the Similitude of a Palace” is the inscription in the perimeter of the gold triangle encompassing a large capital ‘J’ that is Bessie Stradley’s Judson Literary Society pin.  The small, unique metal pin has grown tarnished with age and wear.  It is simple, yet elegant and informative, with a crescent moon attached by a chain, bearing the letters H.O.M.J.  Members of this society may also claim membership to the first female organization in Greenville, a subject of controversy for Furman students and elders of the Baptist church with whom the university shared ties for so long. The young women who donned these sophisticated ornaments made great strides, not only on pen and paper, but in history.           ","As a female student in Greenville just after Reconstruction, it was a time of recovery and rebirth and there was a decided need for innovative change.  Improvements in general, but markedly in education, were occurring throughout the south and The Female College of Furman University was no exception.  Elected president of the school in 1878, Alexander Sloan Townes saw this need and acted on it.  He suggested to one of his faculty members, Mary Judson, to start a literary society for the young women.","A dedicated and disciplined teacher in the classroom and caring friend without, Judson eagerly accepted the task and in September of 1878 she called a meeting of all students who boarded at the school, initially asking them to write essays to be read aloud to their peers.  Students who boarded were obligated to join the society, but in its first year almost all of the students became members.  The women’s essay topics were indicative of their high level of intellect.  The society grew in popularity and size, meeting every two weeks to debate current topics and to present a few of the students’ readings, among other things.  All of the school’s faculty members were present at meetings, and at every meeting the <em>College Mirror</em>, the society’s newspaper, was read.  The paper included humorous tidbits and gossip, but updates and submissions of a more serious nature were also to be found.  For instance, the girls shared their dislike of the option to graduate early, insisting that there were many things that a girl would miss having only completed two years of higher level education.  Also, Mary Judson herself submitted works every now and then, at one time calling for a change of the school’s name.  She asserted that “female” was inhibiting and incorrect and that something like the “Greenville College for Young Women” would be more appropriate.  To add to its accomplishments, the society also began a college library.  It is no wonder women took pride in their association with the organization and displayed their gold pins proudly. ","The Judson Literary Society pin symbolized an active participation in a group that was challenging the limits, aware of improvements in female education and opportunity and ready and willing to utilize these, beginning at Furman, but ready to go out into the world and call women everywhere to do the same thing.  This seemingly small start is one of many that led to the development of women’s agency and voice in today’s world."],"display_date":1884,"search_date":"1884-07-01","locations":[{"id":11537,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":289,"tag":"Art/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5044,"title":"Furman University Catalog, first edition, 1852","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-01-01","end_date":"1852-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The main resource utilized by Furman University students and faculty for information pertaining to academics and university policies/guidelines is the University Catalog.  Furman’s first catalog was first published in 1852, under the Board of Trustees President W.B. Johnson, with James C. Furman as the chairman of faculty.  In its opening pages, the catalog lists every student at Furman and their home state.  The total number of students in 1852 was sixty-eight.","The next pages outline the university’s policy on Admissions, beginning with the statement “the applicant must give satisfactory evidence of good moral character.”  The next section gives a detailed description of the Academics at Furman, beginning with the Primary Education course and Higher Education course.  Next was a Classical Studies program, with two Latin and two Greek language requirements, demonstratng Furman's commitment to education in languages.  Next were the study of Ancient Languages, School of Mathematics, School of Natural Philosophy and descriptive Astronomy, and finally the Thealogical Department.","The next section outlined every Furman student’s favorite subject: exams.  There were three policies regarding exams: first, daily exams of the classes, secondly written exams for Honors, and thirdly public examinations.  Also outlined in the catalog was the Degrees and Distinctions which were Certificate of Distinction, Degree of Proficient, Master, Graduate- BA, Master of Arts, and Graduate of theological Department.","The concluding section of the catalog outlines the university’s policy on tuition.  Tuition in 1852 was $4,200 for the academic year, which excluded clothing and books.  “Contingent expenses” were estimated at $2.00, Boarding was $10.00 per month, and washing was $1.00 per month.","In comparing Furman’s academic structure in 1852 to the structure today, many of the same principles and goals are in effect.  In Herbert Baxter Adams’s “Contributions to American educational history, Volume 4”,  Dr. W. B. Johnson who was the Convention’s president, explained Furman’s core learning objective as a University striving to teach “with a sacred regard to the interests of morality and religion, the principles of Christian liberality, and in favor of the rights of private judgment”.  Today Furman’s religious influence is present throughout the campus in both academics and extracurricular organizations.  In 1859, the first leader of Furman's seminary was chosen.  William Williams was selected for the position, as he was a respected orator and member of the Baptist community. One of the main academic differences was in 1852 upon the charter of the University, Adams’s explains “the intention at the start was to have an academic, a collegiate, a theological, and a law department”.  Clearly, today at Furman students enjoy the freedom of numerous classes within many departments which shows Furman’s growth and expansion in academics.  This growth also proves the University’s commitment to various types of students and the desire to educate a large variety of students with different interests.","In comparing the first edition to the 2009-2010 edition, we see vast differences.  Most notably is simply the excess information in the current edition.  Student’s names and hometown are now listed in the University Directory, and the catalog is one hundred eighty-three pages of detailed information about academics, admissions, student life, academic departments and academic regulations.  The volume of majors and classes offered has significantly grown since 1852 and is reflected in the comparison of the first and current editions of the University catalog."],"display_date":1852,"search_date":"1852-07-01","locations":[{"id":11534,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":143,"tag":"school"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5062,"title":"<strong>History: The Cornerstone of Baptism</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-11-01","end_date":"1876-07-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For two Baptist preachers, both religion and history were necessary to promote a moral life and an educated mind. History had a huge significance for their churches, as well as understanding about their future.  Both preachers taught that by understanding the past, and understanding the nuances of it, one could have attained morality through example.  Although morality can be achieved in many ways, a credible way of viewing the present place and the future outcomes is by viewing the past. (This isn't their thoughts, but mine.  Need to put theirs here).  History was, to them, the cornerstone to the Baptist denomination and Christian religion.","James C. Furman started his sermon with Deuteronomy 32:7, “Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations.”  From this he went into a sermon discussing the history of the Charleston Baptist Association.  The Charleston Baptist Association had existed for one hundred years, and their work had shown great progress.  James Furman preached on the values of looking at the history of organizations as a means to define one’s morality, stating, “Much is gained for human virtue, whether in the family, the State, or the Church, when each member is impressed with a sense of personal moral accountability.”  He also discussed the “most important and interesting phenomena of the human mind…the expectation of the future.”  He went into how the only way to define one’s future is to look at the past.","Twelve days after the celebration of the United States Independence, David W. Cuttino preached an extensive sermon on the history of the Baptist denomination.  He alluded to all the events going on across the nation that celebrated the nation's history up to that point.  The focus of Cuttino's sermon was not on the sacrifices of the soldiers in the American Revolution.  He asked in his sermon, “Shall we celebrate our National Independence and not call to mind the great victories of soul liberty, and do what we can to extend like blessing to all the race of man?”  He discussed what Baptists do believe in, and preached boldly that the Baptist church was the original church in Jerusalem.","Both sermons, however, told a very specific lesson – without the past, the future cannot be written.  Both advocated education of the past as a means to understanding the present and looking to the future.  In order to enjoy the present liberties and look to the future, one must respect the past.  In addition, one must respect it and learn of its false analyses and bias nature.  Rosenberg writes that the Baptists go to near obsession over the past.  Today’s historians strive to learn facts and how bias was attached to that historical fact.  However, learning what the bias is, and finding where else that same kind of bias appeared is its own history."],"display_date":"November 1, 1851 - July 12, 1876","search_date":"1864-03-06","locations":[{"id":11621,"lat":33.5119530737,"lng":-80.8773339627,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGEBURG, South Carolina"},{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":729,"tag":"Religious History"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":540,"tag":"Baptists"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5115,"title":"Women's Welfare Activist Records Inequalities Faced by Female Teachers","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During a visit to America, women's welfare activist, Emily Faithfull examined the vast inequality that existed between men and women teachers and concluded that the situation was unfortunately no better for English women. The \"feminization of teaching\" had just begun to evolve around the time of her visit (1862);the majority of teaching positions in America, from the colonial period to the middle of the 19th century, were occupied by young, white men. She noted, that \"thanks to tradition and prejudice\" female teachers continued to be underpaid. In her writing, she detailed the salaries of male and female teachers who underwent the same training and exams, performed the same tasks, and devoted as much energy and devotion as male teachers, but received less compensation. At that time, the average salary for women teachers in Vermont ranged from eight dollars per month (with board) to $750 a year, while men received around twenty dollars a month to $1600 a year. Faithfull also argued that while women also bore additional responsibilities of taking care of the home and child rearing, they fulfilled expectations that demanded they \"work with alacrity, give up [their] time, be well posted in every subject, dress like ladies, and accept a salary which a French cook would scorn.\" She also refuted the commonly held opinion that married individuals received a higher salary by pointing out that men always received a larger salary regardless of their marital status. While men often had access to greater educational opportunities, the unfortunate reality was that many equally deserving and competent women were widows with families to support. Even the public, she argued, was well aware of this fact and admitted their preference for female teachers due to \"the score of their cheapness, as well as on the ground of their general efficiency.\"<br /><br /> Reknowned for her work as a women's welfare activist, Faithfull's brief descriptions reflected the difficult struggle of equality for women, specifically the obstacles they experienced as teachers. Though legislation did eventually grant greater rights to women, the wage gap between men and women working in the same fields remained. Authors Pulliam and Patten explain that until the advent of \"common schools\"  in the 1830's (similar to modern day public schools), men dominated the field of education and usually used education as a starting point to move other areas of work, such as ministry and law. Prior to this, women predominantly taught basic lessons (alphabet, numbers, Bible studies) in \"dame schools\" run in their own homes for meager wages. Despite the low wages, however, women still longed for the opportunity to impart their knowledge, as it provided them independence and a sense of fulfillment. Initially, schools were reluctant to employ women as teachers, but with the efforts of reformers and activists like Emily Faithfull, who helped to broaden opportunities for women, monumental strides were made in education as well as other fields of work."],"display_date":1862,"search_date":"1862-07-02","locations":[{"id":13558,"lat":44.2738078175,"lng":-72.6171283227,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Vermont"}],"tags":[{"id":802,"tag":"Public School"},{"id":801,"tag":"Teachers"},{"id":576,"tag":"Equal Rights"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":450,"tag":"Powerful Women in History"},{"id":421,"tag":"Women's roles"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5151,"title":"The Education of Women - Mid 1800's","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-02-01","end_date":"1850-02-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Fredrika Bremer was a well-known writer living in Sweden.   By invitation in late 1849, she came to America for a visit.  As she was very much an advocate for the betterment of women in her country, her trip was much anticipated as she had heard of the high regard for American women.  Her writings were very well known in America at the time and she was well received during her two-year visit staying with some of the most prominent people of the mid 1800’s.","Well entertained throughout her visit, Ms. Bremer saw much of the country, spending most of the time on the East Coast in and around the Boston area.  All along her travels she wrote wonderful letters to her sister detailing her experiences and observations.  One such observation written on February 1, 1850, was about education and women.  “The educational institutions for women are in general much superior here to those of Europe; and perhaps the most important work in which America is doing for the future of humanity consists in her treatment and education of women.”","Women were becoming very valued as teachers, which gave rise to employment opportunities in the public school system.  Seminaries and other institutions of higher learning had been established to educate women in this vocation.  Many women interested in the field of higher education came from farms outside of the cities and would go to work first in manufactories to earn the necessary funds to pay for their education.","Women’s right to a higher education did not come without a battle. The male population was not in favor of this newfound interest woman had to better themselves and enrich their lives.   In 1870, the male population considered women too delicate and not up to the challenge of a higher education.  Dr. Edward Clarke, a retired professor at Harvard Medical School, in his publication, <em>Sex in Education, or, a Fair</em> <em>Chance for Girls, </em>warned that women who used up all their vital energies on studies would endanger their “female apparatus”.  Now, I ask you, what was this man thinking?  Regardless of how he felt, ten years later higher education for women was well accepted throughout the country.  One such example of this came in 1890: <em>Ladies Home Journal</em> held a contest in which the girl who sold the most subscriptions to the magazine would win a scholarship to Vassar.","Institutions of higher learning were in large part established and supported by other women who strongly advocated for the better education of their sex.  Emma Willard went on to establish a private academy in Troy, New York, in 1821.  This she established after being turned down by the New York State Legislature to finance a female public seminary.  She was instrumental in re-shaping women’s education throughout the country.  Emma felt women were capable of studying any subject they wanted and should prepare themselves to be self-supporting in a profession.","Philanthropists such as Catherine Beecher and Olivia Sage were two other women who also advocated for the further education of women.

In addition, students were treated to lunch and invited to participate in a softball tournament.  Being an all Indian school in 1945, Pembroke State offered the Lumbee people of Robeson County an opportunity to obtain a secondary education. During this time in American history, the attainment of any degree by a minority was important in the job market, which was still very racially divided.","Due largely to World War II, the 1940s marked the beginning of rapid changes in opportunities for secondary education in the United States. As noted by historians John Rury, Argun Saatcioglu and William Skorupski, after the war the government allotted more funding to education. This allowed more focus to be placed on high school graduation and higher education. In 1940, less than forty percent of 17 year olds enrolled in high school in the south. As the war ended, enrollment increased slightly thanks to expanded government funding, which helped small minority schools such as Pembroke State College. The allotment of more funding allowed the college to offer more courses and programs which eventually led to it becoming an accredited university founded, served and attended by many native peoples of Robeson County.","In 1945, the option for Robeson County high school students to attend Pembroke State College was a rarity, as it was the only four-year accredited college for Native Americans in the nation.

Prior to the institution’s founding in 1887, most Indians were not educated at all or very little, which made the opportunity to complete a degree at an accredited college an achievement to be proud of. The struggle of the Lumbee people and the dedication of many educators and a few politians built Pembroke State College from the ground up, from The Croatan Normal School in 1887 to The University of North Carolina at Pembroke today."],"display_date":"May 15, 1945","search_date":"1945-05-15","locations":[{"id":25656,"lat":34.6401072699,"lng":-79.1035356779,"zoom":9,"place":"Robeson, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":934,"tag":"Pembroke State College"},{"id":935,"tag":"UNCP"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":63,"school_id":9}},{"id":5201,"title":"“Fairmont’s Special Classes Help Handicapped Children”","course_id":63,"status":"P","start_date":"1/14/60","end_date":"1/14/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Most people only think of classes being extended to students who have some form of disability. In 1960, however, when these special education classes were just starting out, they served more purposes then simply serving the disabled. In 1960, schools in Fairmont, North Carolina started to provide classes for children with special educational needs, said <em>The Robesonian</em>. The curriculum in the special education program was aimed at meeting needs that could not be met in regular classroom settings. The term “special education” in North Carolina schools meant an education for those children who needed to work in small groups with material to suit their abilities. These small group classes were extended to children who had speech difficulties also.","The Fairmont schools’ special education classes that focused on speech training worked with students on pronunciation, articulation, stuttering and sound recognition. For students to enter these classes they had to have recommendations from both teachers and parents. The students would engage in two fifteen- minute periods a week for individual instruction, as well as a thirty- minute period for group work. The groups were limited to eight children per group, with a total of about seventy to seventy-five students participating. Other sections of the special education classes in Fairmont classrooms were developed to help those who had trouble in regular classrooms. The objective of these classes was to help the students to adapt socially and be competent in an occupation. Students worked on reading, cleanliness, crafts, and writing. These types of classes could be equivalent to the home economic classes that schools engage students in now.","The 1950s and 1960s was a time full of movements for different rights and passages such as the Civil Rights movement, women’s movement, Latino movement, and several other movements. The show of others fighting for their rights brought on the movement for people with disabilities, who had been unserved and underserved, but wanting to fight for something that meant more to them. This was also a period of the post- World War II economy, and the time of the baby boom, which increased the number of consumers and children needing to be served.   ","Before the 1960s, help for individuals with disabilities was almost nonexistent. For the most part people who had disabilities were confined to state institutions. Many of the individuals confined to these institutions were abandoned children. During the years at these institutions the children were not properly assessed. During the 1960s, however, the federal government with some support from family advocacy associations began to take steps to implement early childhood programs and early intervention services for children with disabilities.  This gave way to special education and by 1968 the federal government had already supported training for more than 30,000 special education teachers and related specialists, closed captioned films viewed by three million people who were deaf, and education for children with disabilities in preschools, elementary schools, secondary schools, and state operated institutions across the country. As time progressed many cases were brought to court, such as <em>Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania </em>and <em>Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia</em>, leading to increased educational opportunities for children with disabilities. These cases stated that the responsibility of state and local school districts was to educate individuals with disabilities, a responsibility derived from the equal protection clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment of the United States <em>Constitution</em>. Public law 94-192 was also a result of these cases; it guaranteed a free, appropriate public education to each child with a disability in every state and locality across the country. The law was monumental to children with disabilities because now they did not have to go years without being properly taught or assessed, but instead were able to get the education that they needed to develop. "],"display_date":"January 14, 1960","search_date":"1960-01-14","locations":[{"id":31512,"lat":34.6401072699,"lng":-79.1035356779,"zoom":9,"place":"Robeson, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":936,"tag":"Special education"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":63,"school_id":9}},{"id":5202,"title":"The Education of the Native American Indian","course_id":63,"status":"P","start_date":"5/26/30","end_date":"5/26/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 23, 1930, School Board Chairman W.H. Godwin told a graduating class “to have some ambition in life, to beware of bad company, obey the laws of the land and in so doing obey the laws of God. Learn to live and act in a way in which people will respect…remembering always that there is a place for skill.” The graduating class he addressed consisted of fifteen youths who attended an Indian grade school in Pembroke, NC; they graduated the seventh grade. The principal of the school, A.N. Locklear, spoke of “the advantages children of the present day are having over those of a few years ago,” and encouraged the graduates to take advantage of the opportunities presented to them. These two individuals gave confidence to over a dozen youths in a manner that, today, is something students hear the world over. However, prior to the 1930s, students who attended the “Pembroke graded school, Indian” did not have a whole lot to look forward to after graduation. The reason? Their Native American heritage.","In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Native American education in the U.S. faced many limitations that white Americans had little incentive to correct. Communication between the educators and the Indian students was one area that desperately needed improvement. According to K. Tsianina Lomawaima and Teresa L. McCarty, white teachers of Native American students expected the children to be stoic. Estelle Reel, Superintendent of Indian Schools in 1900, explained the stoicism in Native American students as a sort of deficiency in the Indians’ mind, nerve, and muscle development, which did not allow for these people to express their emotions. Reel’s statement was one that neglected to take into account the fact that many Native American students only spoke their native tongue, while schools only taught in English, thus taking away the students’ means of expression. The schools, as claimed by some historians, were not so much there to teach as a means to “civilize” the Indians as whites were civilized. This supposed civilizing was done by white teachers who had little to no knowledge of their students’ culture or language. This ignorance led to the teachers assuming their students were either stupid or slow. Such beliefs allowed the school system to blame the student, not the school itself, as the source of any difficulties encountered in teaching the student.","The 1928 Meriam Report, authorized by the Institute of Government Research, gave a harsh, unforgiving look into the inadequate education of Native Americans. Following this report, many reforms were put into practice to improve not only the education of Indian students, but, also the quality of the schools, from food to health care to simple respect for culture. Teachers, who in prior years were insufficient due to a lack of funding, were finally upgraded by hiring individuals who actually had teaching degrees. In boarding schools, meals, having been described as being little better than a form of slow starvation, were fixed to include the dietary necessities for keeping students well nourished and active. In short, the Meriam Report ushered in a series of reforms that allowed Native American students to be educated with the same knowledge, and respect, as white students."],"display_date":"May 26, 1930","search_date":"1930-05-26","locations":[{"id":22209,"lat":34.6401072699,"lng":-79.1035356779,"zoom":9,"place":"Robeson, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":932,"tag":"Native American"},{"id":933,"tag":"Pembroke"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":63,"school_id":9}},{"id":5203,"title":"The Self-Integration Of Pembroke State College","course_id":63,"status":"P","start_date":"7/3/56","end_date":"7/3/56","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1956, the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP) had “a record enrollment of 124 in its summer session,” wrote a journalist for <em>The Robesonian</em>.  The reason for this record breaking enrollment was clear: more white students were taking advantage of the university’s summer sessions.  UNCP, then known as Pembroke State College (PSC), started admitting whites in 1953, one year prior to the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> case.  For decades the university was an Indian-only institution for the advancement Indian students.  But since its foundation in 1887, PSU “expanded, physically and culturally, and has become able to accommodate more students.”  Even though only two of three races who lived in Robeson County were being admitted, for its time the facility served as a model for racial integration in education.","This integration happened because of many elements and advantages that were “mutually agreeable to members of both races” during the university’s self-integration.  None of the other state educational institutions in the counties surrounding Robeson offered summer classes.  All enrolled students were at least eighteen years old and lived independently off the campus.  This meant, according to the article, that the students had the option of coming and going as they pleased to fit their schedules, without any interference from social or family factors.  Besides white students having the opportunity for summer education, Pembroke State needed the increased enrollment to keep itself running as a valuable state institution.  Probably the biggest factor was that students of both races had a shared interest in being educated.  “They are attending college for the purpose of learning,” the paper noted.  There was no intended agenda for advancing, nor preventing, integration. ","When integration was put into law, however, many in the Lumbee community opposed it.  PSC was created during the time of government-sanctioned segregation in education.  The school served as a way that the Lumbee tribe could stand on its own and not have to deal with interference from the white majority in local governance; and, at the same time, prevent their community from being classed with the African American population in the area. Since years before the institution’s foundation, and even today, Lumbee Indians have had to fight for legal recognition and tribal benefits.  The “Cherokee Chief” stereotype, which is still present in the athletic mascots of today, prevents the Lumbee from being legitimized as a tribe in the eyes of the government because they are not seen as “real” Indians.  The creation of UNCP was one of the few ways that the Lumbee were recognized as a tribe.  Educator James Author Jones, who grew up in the Indian only school system, wrote that the Lumbee Indians “remembered their ancestors’ struggle to establish their own school in the 1800s . . . . Such a fight resulted in the establishment of the Indian only school system, a symbol of tribal autonomy, and the founding of what would become the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.” The struggle was about keeping the institution for Indian only education, which, ironically, was actually brought into existence because of segregation.","Despite this resistance, integration of UNCP, and all other educational institutions in the United States, did eventually happen.  Schools were required to integrate, according to Jefferson Currie II, “with all deliberate speed” according to the outcome of the 1954 Supreme Court case of <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>.  In 1954, according to the UNCP website, the schools doors were open to “all qualified applicants without regards to race.”  Few students took advantage of this during the spring and fall semesters, however, delaying the real impact of integration. UNCP integration thus happened at what many believed to be a more natural pace, under the circumstances.  But because of the factors that influenced the enrollment of white students during summer sessions, UNCP’s integrated was believed, and turned out, to be inevitable."],"display_date":"July 3, 1956","search_date":"1956-07-03","locations":[{"id":30574,"lat":34.6401072699,"lng":-79.1035356779,"zoom":9,"place":"Robeson, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":937,"tag":"integration/segregation"},{"id":938,"tag":"lumbee indians"},{"id":934,"tag":"Pembroke State College"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":63,"school_id":9}},{"id":5204,"title":"Changes to School Regulations in North Carolina","course_id":63,"status":"P","start_date":"9/8/04","end_date":"9/8/04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In September of 1904 <em>The Robesonian</em> published a list of suggested rules and regulations from the State Education Department.  In the article was a reminder to county superintendents that State Statutes gave them the authority to adopt all or some of the suggested rules at their discretion.  The rules and regulations published in <em>The Robesonian</em> in 1904 bear little resemblance to today’s school rules.  Many of the rules dealt with how the teachers were to visit the children and convince their families to let them attend school.  The teacher salaries were tied to how many new students they could get to attend as well as the average attendance.  The rules also spelled out what to do when students could not or did not pay for their books and supplies as well as which students could attend without paying tuition. ","These rules proposed in 1904 brought more changes to a system first created in 1863.  During the 1863 session of the North Carolina General Assembly a bill was introduced by Congressman Harris of Cabarrus County to establish a system of graded schools in North Carolina.  One of the items spelled out in the House Bill was who could attend without paying tuition.  The Bill spelled out that children of Confederate soldiers who had been killed or disabled during the war were to attend without paying tuition.  The Soldiers under age thirty five were also allowed to attend without paying tuition.  The tuition waivers for Confederate soldiers were no longer in effect in 1904; however their descendants could still apply for free tuition.  No mention was made in the bill of blacks or Indians in the 1863 bill, but by 1904 schools had been established for both black and Indian students.  These schools were primarily for the teaching of trade skills rather than general education. ","M.C.S.

The requirements were altered in 1920, requiring students to choose two majors offered by eighteen different departments. In 1924, students were required to complete one major of 24 credit hours. In the years following up to 1965, there were only minor changes. In 1965, the college established a minimum GPA of 2.0 that students must maintain in their area of study. In 1973-1974, students were given the option to choose either a departmental or interdepartmental major from two or more departments.","In 1928, students were not only required to complete a major, but also twenty credits of an academic minor.

Since 1945, there has no longer been a requirement for the number of areas of studies a student needed to have.","To encourage Alma students to be unique and creative individuals, the college created a program in the 1973-1974 academic year that allowed students to create their own major.

Written in 1859, the literary piece begins by expressing the unsettled feeling that women encounter during the process of growing older. The fear of growing old is attached to the stigma of being old and unmarried, or becoming an “old maid.” Grout explains the uncomfortable nature of attending social gatherings and being sold and marketed in a sense by one’s own mother. “Doting mamas” play a role in encouraging anxiety about the process of finding a husband amongst young women. Grout stresses the need for young women to reemphasize virtues rather than the superficial traits that men find appealing. She interrogates the notion that marriage should be a woman’s highest aspiration and quotes a girl who proclaims that she has “wed art,” in order to support her point that women can be fulfilled by more than marriage. Florence Nightingale, a woman who devoted her life to the service of others, is also cited as evidence of Grout’s point. The piece finishes with a call for women to value their precious school years, and to not dismiss the joys that such an experience can bring.","Concurrently with the shifting focus away from marriage and onto school, chapter seven “Husbands and Wives” from Karen Lystra’s Searching the Heart: Women, Men, and Romantic Love in Nineteenth-Century America, discusses the new role that love had begun to play in nineteenth century marriage and courtship. This chapter expounds on Grout’s essay explaining that for the first time, during this period, marriage was conceived in terms of love and personal choice, along with the traditional set of sex specific duties that married people were meant to fulfill. The excitement of courtship played an important role in determining the future of a relationship. Although it was acknowledged that this initial feeling often fades, it was thought to lead to deeper and more fulfilling companionship during a marriage. One woman is quoted in the chapter regarding the benefits of being married or not being married and echoing Grout’s essay saying: “not that I would advise you to throw yourself away, for the sake of getting married,” continuing on to explain that there is enjoyment after the excitement wears off (196). Nineteenth century Americans feared a loveless marriage, not confusing companionship with affection.  A lack of love did not play into the reason behind divorce though. Instead, an inability to perform culturally prescribed duties caused a marriage to end during this period, often forcing women to bear the brunt of the blame for the split. The new emphasis on love rather than just money and status during this century explains why women such as E.M Grout could afford to say that men should be evaluated for their, “acts of love, or deeds of mercy.” The new trend in female education and the importance of love in a relationship both affected the changing institution of marriage in the nineteenth century."],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":6121,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5378,"title":"Caroline Cutler Metcalf's Role in Education","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-11-11","end_date":"1874-11-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 11, 1874, S.C.

This is just one of many testimonials taken from an advertising pamphlet from the Virginia Female Institute, published in June 1878. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century, women were finding new ways to exert freedom and attempt to obtain power. One of the ways they found a voice was through education. Upon the creation of female schools, often called female seminaries or institutes, women finally had access to education. There are many similar pamphlets from female institutes and seminary schools located in various parts of the country, primarily the South. The goals of such pamphlets were to advertise the school and ideals it put in value. Most were descriptive of what a “female institute” involves. The documents outline everything at the school, describing the location, buildings, courses of study, and costs. However it goes beyond just mere descriptions. The testimonials from female students that studied at the school, in this case the Virginia Institute, had the goal of clearly expressing the morals and meaning behind the school. Many of the women thank the school for changing their lives, along with a few religion based comments, which seems to be a strong part of The Virginia Institute’s dynamic. Although the document’s goal was to advertise the school, it also was selling the ideal female role that was prevalent at this time. It portrays that women can have the best of both worlds: education, while still upholding womanly traditions. Women are allowed this “gift” of education, while still being told to maintain the expectancies of society while receiving this gift.","Historian Mary Kelley illustrates this interesting dynamic between women and education during the period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that many were encountering in such institutes like this one in Virginia. Women began to be afforded opportunities that never would have occurred before. Kelley points out that education proved to be a powerful tool for women, with some choosing to use their new knowledge to partake in social action, such as the anti-slavery movement. Education could be seen as a training tool for such ventures. However, adding education to their lives did not suddenly change everything and make them equal citizens in society. Women experienced two spheres during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, with education being promoted, yet they often were encouraged to still remain silent and continue their duties in the home. Some spoke out, such as Catherine Beecher agreeing that women’s role in the home gives them power. This left women with conflicting messages at the time; one message prompting women to become educated, while the other prompted women to keep their new found knowledge to themselves in the home or use it only in the profession of teaching."," "],"display_date":"June 1878","search_date":"1878-06-15","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5383,"title":"Women In The Education Arena","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-11-09","end_date":"1838-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 9<sup>th</sup>, 1837, Mrs. Pamela Burr wrote a letter to Mary Lyon, a leader of the women’s rights leader and educator, urging her to consider her two daughters for admission to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.

Thomas F. Parker, who made this speech, was one of the owners of the Monaghan Mill.","Parker had an agenda, clearly evidenced by his speech as having to do with paternalism and its correlation to mill village life. Parker wanted to make the Monaghan Mill a model mill that people could make a living at for their families; a common goal for Progressive Era reformers. According to Parker, the Feudal-like atmosphere where home life was controlled by their employers and ignored by their inhabitants was destroying Democratic institutions.","Urban Historian Carl Smith asserts that the lack of true community was the direct source of the Pullman Strike, an event which left many Americans intrigued by the violent strikers and their unrest. This unrest may not have seemed so distant if the mill villages were not broken from their paternalistic roots. Enhanced industrial and vocational educational support was necessary in order to present the children of these villages with the same opportunities as those that did not live there.","James R. Barrett stated that “Greenville workers weighted the prospects for their own, and their children’s, hopes and deliverance.” The state asserted that more skilled workers should be employed in various crafts, not just the domination of potential employees in cotton mills. At the time, there were no programs or aid that addressed these issues.  Parker became known for his involvement with the YMCA and the employee programs instituted at the Monaghan mill. The vocational opportunities the state of South Carolina could have provided at the time would have increased the residents earning capacity and made them more efficient. This could have been achieved with additional night classes, nursery kindergartens, and more teachers necessary to tend to the large class sizes. Qualified nurses would also have been of great use, as they would not just relieve sickness, but could have started health clubs and made house visits.","The workers were the poorest of the white demographic in the state. In order to come work in the mills, they left their homes, friends, and family. They were stuck with limited economic mobility, and while some variables present in “normal” communities were present in the mill villages, the churches, schools, and doctors were substandard. It was extremely upsetting that the peoples of these villages were viewed as an “inferior people,” evidenced by the neglect shown towards them. According to James R. Barrett, D.W. League’s son Nigel, who worked in the Poe Mill in Greenville, died young because “desire and work ethic met the limits of class, individual and historical possibility.” Change should have been necessitated to make social classes transient through the power of education and increased legislation. While Parker had admirable goals and modest success, this bulletin seems extremely romanticized. Parker seems as though he’s trying to reap more than he can sow in a minimal amount of time. The personal accounts of mill village life negate a lot of what Parker describes as “mill life.”"],"display_date":"1911 - 1934","search_date":"1922-12-31","locations":[{"id":17237,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"Richland, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":756,"tag":"Columbia"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1464,"tag":"Mill Village"},{"id":1465,"tag":"U of South Carolina"},{"id":1466,"tag":"Legislation"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":91,"school_id":4}},{"id":5553,"title":"Lincoln Elementary and High School, McClennanville, SC: A Standing Artifact of Desegregation in South Carolina","course_id":91,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A photograph of Lincoln Elemetary and High School, as it still stands in McClennanville, South Carolina, an unoccupied building with boarded windows, is the starting point for this episode in American history.

Elliot case from neighboring Clarendon County, South Carolina.","Briggs v. Elliot was eventually combined into Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned racial segregation in American schools. In 1951, however, desegregation in American schools did not appear imminent. The Briggs v. Elliot case only established that segregated schools were unequal in facilities. White schools were better funded, newer, had better books and resources, and, as Briggs v. Elliot specifically charged, school buses so that children could attend without walking many miles every day.","The solution to this inequality would eventually be, with Brown v. Board, to integrate black children into these better-funded schools, but the state was committed to delaying court-mandated integration for as long as possible. The immediate answer to the Briggs case was “equalization schools”; represented by 1950s architecture like Lincoln Elementary and High School, built in 1955, that still stands across the state.","These small, flat-roofed, one-story building were built across the state as schools for white and black children. Building all new schools was a costly solution. The County of Greenville alone built 11 new schools between 1953 and 1958.

These type of industrialized skills were in demand during this time period, since this was the type of work that many whom were in bondage, did before the Emancipation Proclamation. There were also opportunities for male students to work on the premises of the school in order for them to pay their way through school, which many took advantage of since they did not have the necessary financial resources to attend otherwise.</strong>","<strong> Because students began attending college at an early age, special attention was given to both the male and female students in the training of simple etiquette, obedience, and courteousness.

Saving up her earnings to pay for her schooling had been difficult, but her dream of one day being able to teach fellow former slaves to read and write so that they could become better Christians helped her bide her time to ensure that day could come."," ","Slavery in the United States could not be boiled down to a universal experience. The varying degrees of cruelty exhibited by owners created a spectrum of suffering on which the lives of slaves fell. Kate Drumgoold had the good fortune of growing up in the years just before the Civil War broke out in the home of an exceptionally caring owner. She was one of thirteen children, but she was frequently separated from her mother and siblings and the family underwent long periods of time without contact. Drumgoold had no choice in being parted from her family during her younger years, but she would not allow this powerlessness to define her life later down the line. Attending church was an integral part of Drumgoold’s relationship with her ‘white mother,’ as she referred to the wife of her owner, and the education she received there endowed her with a sense of personal empowerment. Upon reaching adulthood, though Drumgoold was technically free, she still depended on the employment of the same families who would have owned her just years earlier. Despite this, Drumgoold disregarded official assignments concerning the location of her work, choosing instead to remain loyal to the families she liked better, the women she felt needed her, and ultimately, herself. She asserted power in a situtation where she seemed to have none."," ","It is true that Drumgoold was already a free woman when she shaped her circumstances, but that does not mean her ancestors were unable to create a sense of agency for themselves.

Johnson informs the reader of the ability the slaves in pens had to potentially influence their sales through networks of communication, personal observations, and mastering the art of answering questions. The availability of this opportunity varied and some individuals were more adept at taking advantage of it than others, but what is important is that it did in fact exist."," ","Kate Drumgoold lived in Virginia in a domestic setting, not in New Orleans as a field hand, and she was never put up for auction, but she and the individuals discussed by Johnson exhibited similar skills in manipulation for personal benefit. Those who remained enslaved were only able to control their lives so much, but Drumgoold used the freedom afforded her by time to pay it forward, working to put herself through school so that she in turn could educate other former slaves, continuing the tradition of self-improvement against the odds."," "],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":13742,"lat":37.3864763379,"lng":-77.5769179581,"zoom":9,"place":"CHESTERFIELD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5690,"title":"One Jew’s Rebuttal to the Civil Rights Movement","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/57","end_date":"12/31/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1957, an anonymous Jewish citizen in Greenwood, MS created a pamphlet called “A Jewish View on Segregation”. In his pamphlet, he gives an account of why the Jewish population should prefer segregation. His premise is the same as White Southerners “that the innate inferiority of African Americans would leave them incapable of competing on equal terms in an integrated society”. He claims that like the master of the antebellum plantations of years past, the white Southerner still had the African-American in their charge and needed to segregate them from society where they could still flourish at their own speed. He cites education as being his primary reason against integration. He argues that if the overwhelming ratio of African-American pupils were allowed to intermingle with white students it would lower the quality of education received by all white children. African-African children were on many occasions behind in their school studies and would often have to repeat a grade. These at risk children would in turn be older than the range of the average grade level student and therefore have a hand in exposing the younger students to negative influence. The meaning of the pamphlet goes against the conventional narrative that all Southern Jews were sympathetic to the plight of African-Americans in their struggle of equality.","An opinion poll in 1959 concluded that the Southern Jewish population was more supportive of the Civil Rights Movement than most Southern Whites although they tended to feel this way in secret. The goal of many Southern Jews was to keep a conservative political profile for fear of falling prey to heavy scrutinizing by Southern Gentiles in the form of Jim Crow laws. To the Southern Jewish businessman, Jim Crow laws were similar to the Nuremberg laws of the Nazi Socialist Party of 1930s Germany. These laws were put into force to keep patrons away from the European Jewish merchants in the form of boycotts and to reduce the status of the Jewish population to second class citizenship. In order to be seen as equals in White society, Southern Jews had to choose their words wisely in order to not be regarded as the masterminds behind the Civil Rights Movement and therefore face ostracism of Anti-Semitic rhetoric from the White majority.","Clive Webb, author of “<em>Fighting Against Fear</em>”, states “most southern Jews were inherently sympathetic toward the black struggle for racial equality, their actions were constrained by political circumstances”. Many of the southern Jewish community wished that their Northern counterparts would forego their convictions of wanting to assist with the Civil Rights Movement because their aiding in the various marches and voters registrations would only bring the wrath of white supremacy upon them, not the Northern visitors.  Jewish merchants feared that whites would not patronize their businesses, thus devastating their socio-economic status which also proved to be a leading concern of the southern Jewish community. After being oppressed, contained and driven almost to the point of extinction, it is understandable why many Southern Jews chose not to openly take part in the Civil Right Movement.

The National Advisory Council on Indian Education created this report in 1976 in Washington, D.C. The president of the United States appointed this council in order to assist the 570 native groups affected by the regulations of the Indian educational system. The council comprised of Americans who observed and worked with the native groups. Observations of the council members “revealed that much remains to be done before adequate and equal educational opportunities can be achieved by the Indian people.” The annual report stated that for the Indian people, Indian Education “is a method of teaching that revives an appreciation for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image so that one accepts and understands the environment and social conditions surrounding him.” This appreciation of Indian heritage and positive self-image was lost many years ago when the American government first intruded onto Indian territories. The council addressed this loss in the report to Congress by stating that the American Indians’ 200 years experience under an authoritarian paternal relationship with the Federal Government has “clearly demonstrated that paternalism is alien to liberty and freedom.”","The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States clearly showed how the government progressed and improved upon the Indian Educational System. Historian David Adams exposed that the government originally created the Indian Educational System to civilize the natives, because the natives were believed to be savages. The school system intended to provide the natives with an education that would habituate them to the customs and advantages of a civilized life. The government tried to manipulate the natives into becoming exactly like American citizens, regardless of their heritage, religion, traditions, or tribal affiliations. The government believed that since the native ways of life were different than the traditional American lifestyle, the natives must be less civilized than American citizens. The government most recently formed educational policies regarding Indian Education with goals to respect the wishes and the desires of natives so that the natives may design and manage their own educational programs according to the tribal level. The United States government has allowed the natives to incorporate their own values, beliefs, and culture into the natives’ educational system instead of strictly regulating every aspect of native life. In reality, there has never truly been an American Educational system prior to modern-day; the faux system was based on the standard methods and systems of the non-Indian society and a process by which the government has tried to teach the natives how to become like the white man."],"display_date":1976,"search_date":"1976-07-01","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5746,"title":"Betty Friedan and Second-Wave Feminism in The US","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/60","end_date":"12/31/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the early 1920’s feminism made a huge leap forward causing women to be viewed as people rather than property, but in the early 1960’s many women still felt more needed to be done.

The Feminine Mystique was a book that encouraged women to seek new roles and responsibilities, and to seek identity both personally and in the workplace. Soon after it’s inception The Feminine Mystique was a pivotal point in the fight for women's rights. “Chosen motherhood is the real liberation. The choice to have a child makes the whole experience of motherhood different, and the choice to be generative in other ways can at last be made, and is being made by many women now, without guilt.” Friedan’s book finally made it possible for woman to work outside of the house and at real jobs. Three years after Friedan’s book, in 1966, 28 woman including Betty Friedan herself established the National Organization for Women. Since then NOW has been responsible for many of the major changes to the equality of women, Including the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. “Through more than five decades of activism, Friedan showed the ability not only to formulate feminist theory but also to develop her thinking response to social and cultural change. This has made her one of the most significant political and intellectual leaders in the 20th-century feminism.” This quote from the Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics by Lynne Ford shows the impact that Friedan had on the second wave feminist movement and how she changed the world for all women."," "],"display_date":1960,"search_date":"1960-07-01","locations":[{"id":32057,"lat":39.4750359792,"lng":-74.3341472584,"zoom":9,"place":"Atlantic, New Jersey"},{"id":31817,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1760,"tag":"Gender Roles"},{"id":1759,"tag":"Girl Power"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5854,"title":"Training Workers in Delray: The Coming of the Technical School","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"3/26/21","end_date":"3/26/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In March of 1921, the <em>Detroit Free Press </em>announced plans for the opening of a technical high school in the Delray district in the southwest of the city.

[1]Eleanor Mitchell was the first African-American professor at Rollins College to teach an International Relation courses.  She would later lead the first study aboard trip to explore Africa.  Mitchell goal was “insure that anyone who is interested, could find career opportunity information on international relations.”  During the trip to Africa, student would explore Senegal, Dakar, Liberia’s capital Monrovia, Ghana’s capital Accra, and the last stop Nigeria; which was the “slave coast”, where the slaves would have to wait until they were shipped off to the United States.[2] Following the trip to Africa, she was able to take four students from Rollins to the Model U.N session held at Auburn University, At the Model U.N session these students won a trophy for participating in the French Delegation.Still relatively young at 24, Mitchell opted to continue her studies in political science in Tallahassee. Mitchell worked for Governor Ruebin Askew in 1976 as a Supreme Court Law Clerk; she was named assistant general counsel and was the first black women to serve on the post.[3]","In the 1970’s over 700,00 African-American students were enrolled into college declaring majors such as communications, teaching, business administration, and medical related jobs. [4]After graduating from either a vocational school or a university, students usually continued their studies to obtain masters and doctoral degrees. [5]In 1977 there were 58,515 thousand African Americans to graduate with a Bachelors’ degree and 1,273 African Americans to graduate with a Doctorate degree. [6]Eleanor Mitchell established a successful professional foundation, but more importantly her career paved the way for African American women at Rollins College and other Universities.","[1] Victor Bondi, <em>American Decades 1970-1979</em>, (Detroit Michigan: Gale research Inc, 1995), 164-173.","[2] Simms, Rosemary. \"African Better Bee Ready For Eleanor Mitchell.\" <em>The Sandsour</em>, August 17, 1972."," ","[3] Wilkening, David. \"A Matter of Life and Death Job.\"<em>Sentinel Star</em>, February 7, 1977."," ","[4] Victor Bondi, <em>American Decades 1970-1979</em>, (Detroit Michigan: Gale research Inc, 1995), 164-173."," ","[5] Victor Bondi, <em>American Decades 1970-1979</em>, (Detroit Michigan: Gale research Inc,"," "],"display_date":"1971 - 1979","search_date":"1975-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1945,"tag":"African-American Women"},{"id":1946,"tag":"Higher Education"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision- 1970s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":119,"school_id":5}},{"id":5956,"title":"Growing Urban Life","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/06","end_date":"12/31/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Floral gardens in Detroit were very popular during the early half of the 20th century.

Public School No. 31 had an especially good turnout, with both white and black in attendance. Mayor Robert White Jr. and Founder of Winter Park, Loring Chase, came out to celebrate this moment promoting education.  Chase boasted that “with this, as with Knowles School for white scholars, Winter Park takes formal possession of the best school building in Orange County for a colored school,” and was arguably the best colored school in the state. This dedication towards supporting education in Winter Park both parallels and contrasts with other southern states during this time period. Unlike the rest of the South, Winter Park allowed its black residents to attend school without the fear of being harmed and with the reassurance that they would be receiving a good education. Similar to the communities in other parts of the country, Winter Park began to put more emphasis into the quality of its education.","The fact that a large segment of the town gathered to support the opening of both  Public School No.31 and Knowles School emphasize the importance of education to the community. While the schools were segregated, the ability for the town to support the safety and education of its black citizens was astonishing in comparison to the rest of the south. During this period white southerners embrace racial restrictions for African Americans. These policies banned blacks from experiencing many of the benefits that whites were able to enjoy. For example, while whites were able to go to school and pursue education, racial segregation forced blacks to rely on inadequate resources in their schools. Black students were often forced to learn in broken-down schoolhouses as well as use outdated textbooks. Additionally, students in the South were often victims of lynchings, school burnings and the like. However, in Winter Park the stakes were much different; students were able to attend school with a feeling of security because the town supported both school openings equally. They were also assured that they would receive an adequate education due to Public School No.31 being considered the best of its kind in the state.","Indeed, after the Civil War Florida began to place more emphasis on the importance of education. The US was investing heavily in the importance of education in the 1890s. By 1890 over 70% of all children attended grammar school. Additionally, the amount of high schools in various states rose from 160 in 1870 to over 6,000 by the end of the century. During this time the amount of explicit and implicit expenditures in the US school system rose from $314 million to $515 million in 1880 and 1890 respectively. Winter Park was not far behind in this process. The opening of Knowles School and Public School No.31 in 1890 proves that the importance of education bled into Florida as much as other parts of the country during this historical period."," "," "],"display_date":"February 1890","search_date":"1890-02-14","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2433,"tag":"southern education"},{"id":939,"tag":"Public Schools"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6241,"title":"Seven Days Battle Letter Gives Insight into Soldier’s Lives","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-07-03","end_date":"1862-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter from R. Emmett Martin to his wife, one can see the content, yet suffering state of mind that most Confederate soldiers were in during the days following the Seven Days Battle. Soldiers wanted to be cheerful as they had just won a battle, but were seemingly unable to muster that emotion because of the losses they endured. The Seven Days Battle was technically a Confederate victory. However, historians wonder if it should be considered a victory at all, as the South suffered immense losses.  Martin demonstrated how distressed many southern soldiers were from the deaths and wounds of comrades and the prolonged time and distance between themselves and their loved ones. Other than the effects of the Seven Days Battle on the Confederacy, it also becomes obvious in this letter how poorly educated some of the soldiers were who were fighting in the Civil War.","James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom,</em> has discussed how devastating the Seven Days Battle was to the southern troops. McPherson reports that the Confederate’s “total causalities in these six contests exceeded Union casualties by 20,000 men.” R. Emmett Martin emphasized this reality as he named off several soldiers he knew who fell that day. Martin summarized that “Our regiment lost in killed and wounded one hundred and twenty six [men].” It is questionable how southerners were supposed to consider this battle a victory when they had lost so much.","The importance of family is also emphasized in Martin’s letter. These soldiers had lives and families waiting for them to return home. Martin showed how important his family was to him as he began his letter: “I write in a haste and only a few lines to inform you of my safety after the hard fought Battle…” Martin spent his spare moments on writing letters to reassure his family that he was still alive. At the end of the letter, he also promises to write again, and in more detail, when he had more time.","Lastly, R. Emmett Martin’s letter shows a stereotypical southern Civil War soldier. It seems as though Martin could not have gone more than a few lines in his letter without a spelling error. For example, “I was in with the regimant,” and “it was an awfull hot place.” These spelling errors also could have been due to other factors such as hurrying to write. However, Frank E. Smitha, a lifelong researcher of history and philosophy, explains that southerners overall were in fact poorly educated during this time compared to their northern counterparts. He states that “Of the nation's 321 public high schools only 30 were in the South.”","Overall, the letter from R. Emmett Martin reiterated many ideas from McPherson, and brought plenty of new ideas to the table as well."],"display_date":"July 3, 1862","search_date":"1862-07-03","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"},{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":2229,"tag":"Soldier's letter"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6337,"title":"The Coming of Age of the \"Women of Augustana\"","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/21","end_date":"12/31/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Eliminate them from the school and see what a vacuum there would be” claimed Esthena Randolph of the groups and clubs formed and carried out by women at Augustana prior to and through the 1920s. In fact, the “Berean Bible Class, the Edward Everett Debating Club, the Oriole Chorus, and the Augustana Women’s Club owe[d] their existence entirely to women.” During the 1920s, often known as the progressive era, women in education were beginning to make big moves for themselves and stand out in academia. These major changes were happening very fast as Randolph rightly noted that it had not been many years that women had been “tolerated” at Augustana because in the beginning, only men had attended the college.","After the first woman was admitted to Augustana in 1883, women’s presence continually went up and the Rockety-I newspaper took note of this change and asked her to write an article about their progress. Proudly, Randolph explained how far women in education had come from the days of 1886 where women were not allowed to “recite” in the classrooms until they took a stand and were “welcomed with awed admiration” as their voices were finally heard in the classroom. Being able to form clubs and participate in class changed what college meant to women at this time.","Coming of age as woman in this era had often been defined by marriage, but these women were breaking that barrier and they knew it. Claudia Goldin studied three different cohorts of female students in her working paper entitled “The Meaning of College in the Lives of American Women: The Past One-Hundred Years.” Included within one of these cohorts were women who attended college and graduated between 1900 to 1920. She examined the choices of these college women and discovered that they were marrying at lower rates because “college permitted women to be more discerning in their choice of lifestyle and husband” and many women furthered their education and got jobs as teachers. Important to Randolph’s account of college women is Goldin’s findings that men did not necessarily “like” educated women because of their choice between family and career. Randolph used a more positive position, elevating the women at Augustana, because men were recognizing their feats instead of scorning them. In turn, Randolph’s article was also a tribute to the men of Augustana and the institution as a whole."],"display_date":1921,"search_date":"1921-07-02","locations":[{"id":20952,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":780,"tag":"college"},{"id":2651,"tag":"Clubs"},{"id":2652,"tag":"Equality of Sexes"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6338,"title":"The Role Education Played in Suffrage","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"12/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There she was, standing before Augustana College’s class of 1915 as Valedictorian. Margaret Olmsted gave a speech at commencement on the importance on what it meant to receive a liberal education. Olmsted made the claim that a liberal arts education gave recipients a “broader view and keener insight”[1] to the world. An education such as that comes with a greater reasonability claimed Olmsted; someone that has received a liberal arts education must work to make the world a better place.[2]","At the end of the nineteenth-century and beginning of the twentieth-century women increasingly enrolled into higher education. With the influx in college attendance, women became exposed to worldly views that had been previously less available to them. With the knowledge they were gaining from college, women started to act on that knowledge, which included fighting for more rights such as suffrage.  Part of the movement occurred after the Civil War; due to the role nurses played in the war, nurses started to want more training, more education, and more responsibilities. From 1870 to 1880, white, middle class women enrolled in higher education went from 11,000 to 40,000. Women started to put their progressive education to good use.[3] Education was the catalyst that empowered many women to become involved in movements such as the suffrage movement.","As Olmsted said to her classmates as they were about to graduate, those “who understand things better and know more about the remedies for existing conditions, are more to blame if we do not endeavor to make things right.”[4] Calling to action all that received a higher education, Olmsted wanted her classmates to go forth, making the world’s wrongs into rights. Though Olmsted did not highlight which problems she was speaking of, there is little chance that Olmsted and her classmates had not heard of Alice Paul. Two years prior to the commencement speech, in 1913, college educated Alice Paul led one of the  largest parades of the time through Washington, DC.[5]  Instead of greeting soon to be President Wilson, crowds gather in support of Paul’s suffrage parade which marked the beginning of a campaign that would eventually led to the passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> amendment.[6] Two people and one group that all with college education, fighting for a better tomorrow. Paul and the nurses were clearly working for the passage of women’s suffrage. Olmsted was making broader claims for her class to get involved in bettering the world, showing how college education was a catalyst for social issue involvement.","It is clear that as more and more women began to receive higher education, women became increasingly involved in social issues. Many women had different reasons for becoming involved in the suffrage movement. One reason can easily be that as women became educated, especially with a liberal arts education like Olmsted received from Augustana College, they become more aware of social inconsistences and were equipped with the knowledge to solve those issues."," ","[1] Margaret Olmsted, “A Liberal Education,” <em>Augustana Observer: Commencement 1915 May 1915</em>, Vol. XIII.

At least twelve male students at Augustana took it upon themselves to get the cars up the hill in front of Old Main and set up a used car lot overnight. There were no women present, at least in the photograph. The pranksters probably assembled a team of men to move the cars, as they had the muscle and might to perform. Don Peterson, a student at Augustana in the late-1940s, explained that Crazy Connie referred to the president of Augustana at the time: Conrad Bergendoff. Other signs set up on the lawn promoted “Super Salesmen Betsy Brodahl, the Dean of Women, and Happy Harry Johnson...the Dean of Men.”  In fact, Peterson’s own car was set up on the lot with a sign advertising “good family car $25.”","The students who set up Connie’s car lot were not the first or last to conduct large-scale, masculine campus pranks at Augustana. In 1949, a dozen or so men snuck into a women’s dormitory for a “panty raid,” an invasion of the women’s privacy and a prank with overtones of power and control. In 1955, a few male students scaled Old Main to decorate its dome like a teapot. Scaling was an activity that took physical strength, and the symbol the men used in their prank was a feminine symbol (teapots connoted tea parties, an activity for women). Peterson recalled that Augustana students once loaded hymnals into a Model-T car, locked it, and got it into the Old Main basement, another prank that would’ve taken physical might in order to move the car. All of these pranks took place before, during, or not long after Peterson attended Augustana as an undergraduate.","Crazy Connie’s Used Cars did not stand alone when it came to pranks at Augustana; however, other decades at Augustana do not have the track record for (in)famous pranks as the late 1940s-1950s did. Before the 1940s, Daniel A. Clark explains that college education in America was viewed as an upper-middle class institution: aristocratic young men and women ascended to lofty world of academia. At the end of World War II, however, the GI Bill introduced an influx of everyman veterans into the college atmosphere. The clash, according to Clark, of “Joe College” and “Joe Veteran” had a democratizing effect on higher education—it became more popular and accessible. However, it might have also heightened male students’ sense of masculinity (some male veteran students refused to follow the traditions of younger male students, another possible power play with masculine connotations). Most of the pranks were performed by men, some like the Panty Raid at the expense of women. Masculine ideals, especially in terms of veteran soldiers, may have driven the students responsible for pranks: a desire for control, of asserting dominance. When Crazy Connie’s happened, maybe those male students were showing off their sense of masculinity as much as their sense of humor."],"display_date":"November 1951","search_date":"1951-11-15","locations":[{"id":30089,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6452,"title":"Reconstruction: Knowledge is Power","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-08-24","end_date":"1867-08-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["This document is an open letter to General Grant from Major General Pope in regards to allowing confederate leaders to be involved in the Reconstruction process in the South. The main piece of evidence used by Pope to further his argument about rebel officials role in reconstruction, is a speech made by B.H. Hill.  Pope claims that the speech represents the feeling of the majority of the whites in the south, that reconstruction will never be accepted because of the drastic changes it would require.  Although, Pope makes it clear that he does not want their ideas and thoughts muffled at all from the United States, but that having an open conversation with these ideas will better help it to not happen again.  If these voices were kept silent, Pope argues that reconstruction would fail within a few years. Having this discussion available for everyone to hear would actually make reconstruction strong and last long, since people would have \"with[stood] the influence of the secession party\".  Overall, Pope writes how reconstruction can only be successful if the people in the south support it and work towards it, otherwise discontent will fester until more conflict inevitably boils over. Pope supports the Reconstruction Acts actions towards disenfranchising since he believes it would keep more rebel thoughts out of actual politics.  Other sources that Pope uses are letters by Hill, by Governor Perry of South Carolina, of Hershal V Johnson of Georgia and many others who represent the anti-reconstruction of the South.  For Pope, reconstruction is not just about ending the rebel discourse, but maintaining efforts for reconstruction and reconnection to the Union long after the individual rebel voices fade away and the states are readmitted. In order to know how to make reconstruction successful in the long term, the rebel ideologies and arguments must become fully developed in the open and public sphere, according to Pope.  He also shows how the education and social integration of the freedmen is essential to making them a part of society, and will better the society.  Pope says that any attempts to \"check\" the education of the freedmen would severely undermine any progress made. Pope concludes the letter to General Grant by claiming that he believes any straying from the course he outlined for reconstruction would end in disaster, destruction, and the winning of evil.  ","Major General Pope's perspective seems particularly unique when Blight's book <em>Race and Reunion </em>is taken into account.  According to Blight, the \"politicians sought to permanently bury the issues of war and simultaneously used those very issues to fan the flames of political difference\"(Blight 98).  Pope's open concept take on Reconstruction and dealing with rebel leaders/thoughts is just the opposite of this, which seems to be against the majority opinion based on Blight's writing.  Pope's perspective, while not part of the three main perspectives of the South (white unionists who moved south during Reconstruction, white southerners--poor men and slaveholders, and the freedmen), provides historians with what appears to be a minority perspective on Reconstruction. What Pope wanted for the reunion of the United States and for Reconstruction was highly unlikely during that time given the increased polarization of politics during that time.  As Blight says, the politics became about arguing over the end of the war, who won, and who would win.  Major General Pope had an optimistic approach to the reunion, however since the war was still being fought in the political arena, it made his plan unrealistic.    "],"display_date":"August 24, 1867","search_date":"1867-08-24","locations":[{"id":52852,"lat":35.7795897,"lng":-78.6381787,"zoom":9,"place":"Raleigh, NC"}],"tags":[{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":1115,"tag":"Freedmen"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2843,"tag":"Confederate leaders"},{"id":2844,"tag":"Reconstruction Acts"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6453,"title":"The Burning of Sterling High School 1967","course_id":148,"status":"P","start_date":"9/15/67","end_date":"9/16/67","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 15, 1967, the Greenville News reported a story on the burning down of Sterling High School.

This points out the sense of racism that was still existing in Greenville, SC during 1967."," The policemen’s choice not to comment on the matter is another indicator of just how careless people were toward African-Americans.

One can see how racial tensions and attitudes were present during this time, because the overall event is seen as a cover-up, and is even written as so.

One entry, “The New Jones High School”, contains information on Jones High School after its recent renovation in May 1952[1]. The entry on Jones High School grants a valuable insight into the funding, resources, and conditions of segregated schools in Orlando. Additionally, this information on Jones High School in 1957 provides a point of reference that can be used to draw comparisons between Jones High School and other Southern segregated schools.","            The entry on “The New Jones High School” in <em>The Voice of Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce: Business Directory 1957</em> was published at an interesting time in the African-American fight for civil rights. Three years prior, African-Americans won a major victory in the Supreme Court Decision on <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. By negating the <em>Plessy v. Fergusen </em>Supreme Court Decision of ‘separate but equal’, de jure segregation was declared unconstitutional. However encouraging this decision seemed, the fact remained that de facto discrimination was still a reality in the South. Thus, it is somewhat surprising that Jones High School was able to provide the resources that it did. Additionally, the renovation that improved the conditions of Jones High School in 1952 occurred before the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> yet after the renovation the value of the school increased by $100,000.00 bringing the total value of the school up to $1,000,000.00[2]. There are a few potential reasons for the ability of Jones High School to provide a relatively high quality of education to its students, although the reason is not provided in the entry. Firstly, the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> decision of ‘separate but equal’ provided a legal standing for organizations such as the NAACP to challenge the inequality of funding between white and black schools. Secondly, the African-American community in Orlando may have been prosperous enough and invested in the value of education enough to provide money to Jones High School. Alternatively, it could be that Jones High School was the only African American school in the area that was able to provide these resources and other African-American schools in the area simply did not exist or were under funded. In this case, Jones High School, although well equipped, could have remained inadequate to educate all the African-American children in the Orlando area. Additionally, <em>The Encyclopedia of Florida </em>cites a large influx of workers to the Orlando area numbering near 11,000 in 1956 when the Glenn L. Martin Company established a defense plan in Orlando[3]. Many of these workers may have been African American and could have brought families with them. Thus, the African American population in Orlando may have increased to the point where the resources of Jones High School may have been inadequate.Ultimately, it is unclear from the primary source document how Jones High School received funding for such an extensive renovation and whether this renovation met a standard of equity with the surrounding white schools.","            The renovations undertaken at Jones High School in 1952 provided “16 standard classrooms; a chemistry laboratory; a physics laboratory” and other spaces for academic pursuit. Additionally, however, much of the space provided was also for non-academic, work-related training such as “[an] advanced cooking classroom, a classroom for childcare…[a] training room for the training of table service [and] cooks…[and] one agriculture classroom”[4]. This dual emphasis of academic advancement and training for manual work represents the influence of Booker T. Washington’s philosophy of ‘advancement through education and work’ that persisted up to the Civil Rights movement. From the historical context surrounding the primary source and the primary source itself, it seems that Jones High School represents, to a certain extent, a compromise between the demands of African-Americans being voiced at the beginning of the Civil Rights movement and the de facto segregation that permeated the culture of the American South. This raises the question of whether these conditions were common across the South in African-American Schools. More specifically, what were the social and cultural experiences of African American students in the segregated south at the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement?","            In her study titled <em>Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South, 1935-1969: A Review of Common Themes and Characteristics</em>, Vanessa Walker provides a synthesis of many different studies focusing on the quality of African-American education in the segregated south. Walker counters the commonly accepted depiction of African American schools wholly inferior to white schools[5]. More specifically, Walker states that the common view of African-American education before desegregation highlights “inequality in facilities, lack of transportation, shorter school terms, teacher-pupil conflicts, overcrowding” and more[6]. Additionally, Walker claims that the general depiction of African-American education portrays “African American students and their parents…as complacent” in regards to education[7]. However, in her analysis of other studies on the subject of African-American education Walker finds “the emergence of Black common schools were largely attributable to the interests of ex-slaves in education as a means for liberation”[8]. Ultimately, Walker claims that her analysis of studies on African American education indicates, “that the segregated schools in the South appear to have certain consistent characteristics” that counter the common conception of African American schools as vastly inferior to white schools[9]. Rather, African American schools often employed “exemplary teachers and principals…increasingly well trained and who created their own culture of teaching”. Additionally, the adversity facing African American schools often shaped the characteristics of the African American schools: “many of the schools’ characteristics appear to have been a direct response to the challenges they faced and intimately connected to the oppressive circumstances in which they operated”[10]. Specifically, African American schools placed an emphasis on cultural programs, strengthening the community, and leadership from the principal that actively endorsed ideologies on how to advance African-American civil rights[11]. Thus, although it was true that African American schools were often underfunded, they remained one of the central hubs of African American communities and experienced lots of support from the community.","            At more of a micro-level analysis, Linda Coats investigates the personal experiences of African-Americans that attended segregated schools in the south. Coats’ article <em>The Way We Learned: African American Students’ Memories of Schooling in the Segregated South</em> attempts to answer the question “what memories of school have lasting impact on students and what are some distinguishing teacher behaviors that impact students’ academic and career success?”[12]. Coats’ findings are in line with the general analysis provided by Walker. Coats discovered a theme of caring and dedication amongst teachers at African-American segregated schools in the face of racism and discrimination: “African American teachers during this era had to face many challenges brought on by socio-political factors…[yet] they were motivated to work harder to ensure that their students learned”[13]. First hand accounts from students also indicate that teachers were focused not only on education but holistic improvement of their students. One account states, “Teachers were nurturers and guides. Just as our parents, they expected good personal grooming, manners, your best effort, respect, and personal responsibility”[14]. Additionally, accounts support Walker’s finding that African American schools placed emphasis on community building: “students’ memories provided a glimpse into the teachers’ lives outside of school. For most, there was a powerful relationship between the school and the larger community”[15]. Furthermore, Coats states “this shared relationship, perhaps, contributed to their responsibility not only to their students’ academic development, but for their social and moral development as well”[16]. Ultimately, Coats’ findings from first hand recollections of students’ experiences in segregated African American schools indicate the importance of schools in the community and the schools’ role in not only education but also furthering the movement for racial equality.","            Given the points presented by Coats and Walker, it can be seen that African American schools provided a hub for the surrounding community while also providing hope for the advancement of racial equality via education. Furthermore, schools provided a place where philosophies for the advancement of African Americans could be implemented by teachers and principals. Thus, schools like Jones High School were, and still are, incredibly important for the surrounding communities and the fight for racial equality at a national level."," ","[1] The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce, <em>The Voice of Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce: Business Directory 1957</em>, “The New Jones High School,” 34.","[2] The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce, 34.","[3] <em>Encyclopedia of Florida</em>, “Dictionary of Places: Orlando.” New York: Somerset Publishers, 218.","[4] The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce, 34.","[5] Vanessa Siddle Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South, 1935-1969: A Review of Common Themes and Characteristics,” <em>Review of Educational Research</em> 70 (2000): 253, accessed March 5, 2016, doi: <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1170784.\">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1170784.</a>","[6] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 253.","[7] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 253.","[8] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 257.","[9] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 276.","[10] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 276.","[11] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 276.","[12] Linda T.

Board of Education</em> decision of 1954 left many African Americans in the 1950’s reeling for a workable solution. The reasonable skepticism held by many African Americans allowed functionally segregated institutions such as the Eccleston-Callahan School, an institution for African American students of differing needs, to exist years after desegregation was supposedly put into practice.","Without a clear objective, only hope for a poorly delineated alleviation of tensions without an actual understanding of the tensions, entities such as UNESCO had begun to try to explain away race as a simple matter of genetics as early as 1952, a full two years before the<em> Brown </em>decision. However, without acknowledging that race relations were a social problem, actions that were often undertaken with good intent did more harm than good.","Urban education became a distinct subset of the public education system, due to African American families having been left out of the shift to suburbia. This unofficial segregation only worsened with the advent of special education. While, for white Americans, special education was seen as a step away from the dangerous practice of institutionalization and a step towards inclusion, the mandating of special education services when combined with the <em>Brown</em> decision allowed for yet another level of separation between African American children and their white peers. This divide has only become more obvious with time, with statistics for the 2000-2001 school year showing that while African American students accounted for only 14.8% of all school aged children, they represented 19.8% of students receiving special education services."," "," "],"display_date":"1954 - 1916","search_date":"1935-07-02","locations":[{"id":52956,"lat":27.6648274,"lng":-81.5157535,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":43,"tag":"Desegregation"},{"id":936,"tag":"Special education"},{"id":3106,"tag":"urban education"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6592,"title":"Communism in Education","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"12/31/51","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Paul Wagner “preached on a theme that audio-visual education is the only remedy for the woefully inadequate teaching methods in public schools all over the country.” Wagner’s ideas of implementing audio-visual technology into Rollins College resulted in society accusing him of being Communist. But why? The emergence of McCarthyism became a nation-wide sensation that placed fear into society. McCarthyism exaggerated and exploited the Communist threat, creating an atmosphere of false accusation in which people believed they were bettering society.  “And their voices were all the more credible because of their anti-Communism, which was born not out of fear or anxiety, but rather the conviction about the wrongness of Communism.” Jennifer Delton argues that the goal of anti-Communism was to thwart liberals, not to get rid of Communists. She continues to state that Communism attacked and took over the leftist and liberal organizations due to the fundamental contradiction in the Communists’ relationship to mass movements.","Communist influence was to be kept out of all aspects of society, including education. American people became increasingly worried that Communist influences would infiltrate the schools and pervert the minds of children.  The U.S. Commissioner of Education, Earl McGrath, played a role in spreading anti-Communism throughout education. McGrath summarized the thoughts of many Americans when he stated, “Two conflicting philosophies of government and of life are now competing for the allegiance of the peoples of the world. One of these is totalitarianism… in Communist states of Russia and her satellites. The other is democracy.” When Wagner pitched his idea of audio-visual education, he believed it needed to be implemented after how successful it had been in Germany under Hitler, in which he made Belgium a Fascist state in two years.","Soviet Foreign Minister Andri Vishinski sought to conquer the world not with an atom bomb, but by spreading  “... our ideas, our brains, and our doctrines.” Due to this, civil liberties were impaired in America all in the name of national security. The academic freedoms of educators were limited, as seen with Wagner. James Rodgers and Wesley Null argue that the longer America faced the Communism problem, the broader the definition of “Communist” became. McGrath understood that the Cold War was different, as it was more intellectual than physical. Public schools existed under McGrath to win the Cold War. In order to help win this battle, McGrath implemented “Americanization” programs that teached new immigrants the American way of life. Teachers were screened to make sure that they were not too liberal, and were forced to sign loyalty pledges. Some teachers were fired and even blacklisted from employment in America.","A study was conducted on the tolerance of Communism amongst college students based on social background, secular values and religion at the University of California-Berkeley campus. According to Armand Mauss, the right-wing groups are anti-Communist and hold traditional values. The primary source of this anti-Communist group was religious and militant beliefs. Left-wing groups hold more liberal ideology and do not condone limiting civil liberties.","Paul Wagner’s idea of audio-visual technology was shut down due to Cold War politics. These politics allowed for society to accuse Wagner of being a Communist because of his liberal education idea. Little did society know that Wagner’s idea was ahead of it’s time, and audio-visual technologies would play a huge role in the future of education."," "],"display_date":"1947 - 1951","search_date":"1949-07-01","locations":[{"id":52921,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2247,"tag":"communism"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":968,"tag":"Liberal Arts"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6601,"title":"The Beginings of Change for the Voice of Women in Collegiate Settings Post-WW2 as Exemplified by Rollins College","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"4/18/51","end_date":"5/24/51","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Despite the overwhelming trend of female-dominated student bodies during and immediately following World War II, the actuality of collegiate representation and consideration for female students and faculty in the United States was disparagingly low. Unfortunately, Rollins College, an educational institution founded in 1885 by Lucy Cross and the Congregational Church, was no different from the majority of its peers. In the post-war era, colleges across the nation suffered from lowered attendance rates, and with the impending conflict in Korea potentially reducing their student body yet again, many institutions felt they were in a time of crisis. Rollins College was, again, no exception, with this tumultuous landscape providing the opportunity for the greatest scandal the college has faced to date, the Wagner affair.","Paul Wagner was brought to Rollins to serve as president after the esteemed career of Hamilton Holt. Handpicked by Holt himself based on promises of a more engaged student body, Wagner initially seemed all the heir-apparent he had sold himself to be; however, as the Korean anxiety grew and financial crisis seemed eminent, his series of totalitarian demands upon the student body and faculty pushed the already shaken college into action, and Wagner was unwillingly ousted only two years into his presidency. As Wagner’s career burnt out, Holt was called back into action in hopes of gathering support in removing his successor, which was deemed necessary if the college were to survive. In his attempts, Holt engaged in personal correspondence with many of the members of Rollins’ Board of Trustees, including Dr. Paul Stillman of California.","In his correspondence with Stillman, Holt makes it clear that he will ensure insomuch as he can the compensation of Stillman, and other out of state trustees, who attend to ensure that Wagner is removed from office, reaffirming that, if nothing else, the Rollins Board of Trustees was something of an old boys’ club. Of the eleven trustees who voted to remove Wagner from office, only two were women, and one of these was the wife of acting President McKean. The men involved in the administration of Rollins were from an elite and educated class of white Americans, with most of the trustees living lives of prestige and security even in these uncertain times, far from the issues that affected the students and faculty of Rollins College.  ","Obviously, the social norms were not on the side of femininity. As smized by May in her work<em> Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era</em>, “These public health professionals argued that inside as well as outside the home, women who challenged traditional roles placed the security of the nation at risk.” Retroactively, these beliefs and actions seem absurd, if not blatantly incorrect and offensive, and within the confines of the decade, and even with regards to the Wagner affair, female students, administration, and faculty would begin to push for more presence in higher education."," "," "],"display_date":"April 18, 1951 - May 24, 1951","search_date":"1951-05-06","locations":[{"id":52973,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Rollins College, Winter Park"}],"tags":[{"id":3141,"tag":"gender inequality"},{"id":438,"tag":"Rollins College"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6650,"title":"Hampton Institute: A Grand Opportunity for Freed African Americans","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"2/10/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Civil War era, freed African Americans from the North traveled South to Hampton Institute for the opportunity to mentor African Americans from the South who only had skills an average slave would have.

This was the first formal public school system in Virginia. The fault with these school systems is they were exclusive to white people. African Americans were not allowed. The white people who went were very poor as well and these schools were known as “free schools”, or “charity schools”. As time went on during that year, the ratification of these laws for the schools went into place. When the laws went into place, former slaves were allowed to enter the schools. They wanted to enter children into these schools so that they would not go on with their lives in ignorance and become vagrants. "," This law passing was one of the most important things to come out of the Reconstruction after the Civil War. This event set in motion how the public school systems work in modern society. They separated different districts and at the time, separated the schools by color of skin. Before this time, schools were few and far between. There was no uniform system and only the rich could attend school. The public school system was established in 1870, so that all could attend school and all would be given the same, equal opportunities. "," A lot of people were against these laws because they helped out the free slaves. They considered it too expensive to pay for their kind. They said that the wealthy should not have to pay for the education of poor people. Because of these complaints, the funding for this project was cut back. The leader of these laws, William Ruffner, worked tirelessly to get this school thing in place. He tirelessly worked and forced his promotion on this subject matter. He claimed that religious views would be kept out of the system and that it would not be unfair to tax people in order to fund the school system. He claimed education was good for society as a whole, so therefore the people should fund it. "," Education was important to the people, but not important enough to let it come out of their taxes. Eventually, Ruffner got the laws passed and was able to get to a stable funding in order for the school system to not fail.

At fifteen years old, she was sent there on the charge of “incorrigibility,” a status offence that sent minors to reform schools. While there, Fitzgerald, as an African American, was racially segregated into different living quarters than the white students and was “subject to physical abuse” [1].","                Despite Fitzgerald being an African American cultural icon, her story is not an uncommon one.   It was common practice to send girls with status offences and other crimes to schools meant to reform their characters.  For example, there were two different efforts for reform schools for girls of color around the time of Fitzgerald’s own incarceration: the Industrial Home School for Colored Girls, which was created in 1916 in Virginia, and a proposed Georgia school for “delinquent colored girls” that the General Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs endorsed in 1937 [2].","                In many reform schools, girls were segregated by race. Additionally, most schools featured hard labor for the sake of reforming girls’ characters [3]. For example, students at the Virginia Industrial Home School for Colored Girls performed hard labor such as farm work and hog raising for the sake of reformation. As a result, girls were only allowed to attend school half a day and then worked the farmland belonging to a member of the board of trustees, and their education consisted mainly of domestic work training [3]. Girls who were eventually paroled from the Industrial Home were forced into work with an arranged employer and the employer could return the girl at any time if the employer felt that the girl’s work proved unsatisfactory [3].","                Although these segregated reform schools no longer exist, the concept of disenfranchised education still remains. As Wald and Losen state, children who are more likely to receive inadequate education are more likely to be targeted for disciplinary actions and are therefore more likely to be discriminated against in school by getting reprimanded or punished. They continue by indicating that the groups most likely to be targeted by school disciplinary action are students of African American and Latino heritage [4]. So, students of color who are being targeted are more likely to see hindrances to their education, and this can set in motion a way for these students to be more likely targeted by prison systems for status offences.  In this way, just as Fitzgerald was considered incorrigible, students today are facing disciplinary action which can land them in prison."," ","                However, Wald and Losen state that this school-to-prison pipeline is in place because students of color are more likely targeted due to their lack of education, which has been in place since the repealing of Jim Crow laws governing school segregation [4].

County School Board of Prince Edward </em>where it was argued that the closing of Prince Edward County public schools was a form of racial discrimination.  The court ruled in favor of Allen citing it is a form of discrimination and the county was expected to reopen schools to all pupils regardless of race.  However, Prince Edward County kept the schools closed for two more years in spite of this ruling leaving many black students without any formal education.  In the publication “<em>Their Voices, Our History: Stories of Prince Edward County Virginia</em>”; Everett Berryman, Jr. who was twelve at the time public schools closed, explained that he attended a grassroots training center run by his mother instead of public school.  He did not know that he was missing out on anything until his cousin from Baltimore proved much more proficient in reading and math than Everett.  To get a good education, Everett was forced to move in with a family friend so that he could attend school in nearby Appomattox County. ","In 1963, the NAACP and other civil rights groups created privately- funded free schools open to all students on an integrated basis.  In March of 1964, lawyers argued <em>Griffin v. School Board of Prince Edward County </em>in the Supreme Court.  The court ruled in favor of Griffin in a six-to-two decision.  The majority opinion, written by Justice Hugo Black, asserted that the School Board of Prince Edward Counted had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by denying equal protection or opportunity. They also held the school board in contempt of the <em>Brown v. Board of Education </em>(1955), which ordered it was “ necessary and proper to admit (complainants) to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed.” The court also asserted that even though local government control led public education, they could not close public schools because citizens have a right to free accessible education.","In 1964, an estimated 1,500 students returned to public schools in Prince Edward County. This event marked the end of massive resistance in Virginia. "],"display_date":"January 6, 1964","search_date":"1964-01-06","locations":[{"id":53117,"lat":37.1982888,"lng":-78.4297187,"zoom":8,"place":"Prince Edward County, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1795,"tag":"integration"},{"id":1071,"tag":"Civil Rights Movement"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":178,"school_id":3}},{"id":6798,"title":"Catherine Barker's School Experience","course_id":182,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-01-01","end_date":"1820-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["              Catherine Barker was a young student in Marietta in the early 1800s and experienced firsthand the bias against girls in education. While at school, Catherine was taught things considered proper for a young lady to learn: sewing, stitching, and working samplers. How to make clothing was an important skill for a young woman to learn because they could make money from it. One way they could demonstrate their skill was through samplers. Catherine’s mother, however, did not want her girls to just earn money through needlework. Catherine expressed in her memoir that “Many girls that I knew were smart enough, to spin and weave flannel and exchange it for calico for dresses, my mother thought it not good economy for us.” Many of the older women in town did not agree with Mrs. Barker’s thinking. According to them, girls only needed to learn math to sew or how to read and spell for letter writing, “but beyond that, they did not see any use in the teacher putting it into the heads of their daughters to study history, algebra astronomy and the like, just intended for men that go to congress to make laws.” These fields of study were not considered necessary for feminine duties, and therefore, they believed should have no part of a girl’s education.","            Catherine’s sister, Fannie, was negatively affected by the different educational quality for boys and girls. Fannie wanted to be a writer, but she was accused of copying when she wrote because girls were not supposed to be good writers. While living on the frontier, Fannie would have tremendously benefited from going to college. College was not an option for Fannie though because “the colleges were closed to women,… a female writer was a strange thing out of place surely.” While Catherine and Fannie were not afforded the opportunity to go to college, their brothers attended Ohio University.","            During the early 1800s when the Barker’s received their education in the Northwest Territory, there were numerous school houses that went through a high rate of teachers. Teachers were not classically trained for the profession and as a result, “The students got a heavy dose of the schoolmaster’s particular field of expertise.” For example, a doctor taught more science and a mathematician concentrated on algebra and geometry. Since each teacher stressed different disciplines, the quality of education was uneven throughout the region. Each student was exposed to different fields of study.","            Education was probably not a priority in newly settled territories, however, this was not the case in the Northwest Territory; “the moral and educational quality of the early settlers was extremely high.” Indeed, the Muskingum Academy, which had an expense of $1,162 in 1797, illustrated the emphasis placed on education in early Marietta. Despite this, Catherine Barker was not able to enjoy the educational quality afforded to others because she was a girl. Although the settlers thought education was important, not all of them believed in the equality of education between boys and girls."],"display_date":"1812 - 1820","search_date":"1816-07-01","locations":[{"id":53139,"lat":39.415352,"lng":-81.4548436,"zoom":8,"place":"Marietta, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Professional Historian","school":"Marietta College","course_id":182,"school_id":101}},{"id":6820,"title":"An American Educational Exclave","course_id":189,"status":"P","start_date":"11/3/46","end_date":"12/31/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 22nd, 1965, the New York Times ran a special feature on the presence of a large brick building in Kyoto built in the mold of American colonial-era architecture. Amherst House, apart of the Doshisha University campus, stood in stark contrast to the traditional wooden homes, tile-roofed temples, and the ornate palaces populating the primordial former imperial capital of Japan. The educational institution, which is attached to a Japanese-style tea house, is host to a unique synthesis of Eastern and Western subject matter and methods of inquiry. Though Doshisha University was supported by the eponymous Amherst College of Massachusetts, it owed its American traditions to its founder, who in 1875 defied the law of the land to pursue an education in the United States. Adopting the name Joseph Hardy Neesima, he eventually returned to his homeland to proliferate the knowledge he obtained abroad. At the time of the article, Doshisha University provided Japanese students living in a majority Buddhist country with a Christian education from kindergarten onwards. (NYT, 6)","The popularity and success of the school was due in large part to the reordering of the Japanese education system following the country’s defeat in the Second World War. The new Japanese Constitution, ratified on November 3rd, 1946, stripped the emperor of political authority, handed power to a democratically elected National Diet, declared human rights inviolable, and forbade war. (Saito and Imai, 584) The U.S government also brought over American education experts with the mandate of promoting democracy and steering the Japanese away from a “pre-war education based upon militarism, nationalism, and the Emperor system.” (Saito and Imai, 584) The time between the end of the war and the 1960s is sometimes referred to as the “Period of Love/Hate” because while many Japanese sympathized with anti-occupation protests, there was a general yearning for the American way of life. (Yoshimi and Buist, 434) In September 1945, just a month after Japan’s surrender, the Japanese-American English Conversation Booklet became a national bestseller, demonstrative of the underlying allure of Americanism within the urban middle class. (Yoshimi and Buist, 435) American military bases and the soldiers who inhabited them exerted powerful cultural influence, inducing the spread of Western fashions like jazz, denim, and animated cartoons. (Yoshimi and Buist, 434) The 1960s, a decade characterized by miraculous economic growth, brought about a demographic shift towards urban life, allowing for increased access and consumption of American material and cultural exports. (Yoshimi and Buist, 434) The shifting social landscape strengthened the connection between education and socioeconomic standing in post-war Japan.
