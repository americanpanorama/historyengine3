Zora once said:","\"I was born in a Negro town.  I do not mean by that the black backside of an average town.  Eatonville, Florida is, and was at the time of my birth, a pure Negro town-charter, mayor, council, town marshal and all.  It was not the first Negro community in America, but it was the first to be incorporated, the first attempt at organized self-government on the part of Negroes in America.\"","Zora’s life reflects the same “attempt” as did the formation and incorporation of Eatonville; she paved the way for all female writers in America, specifically those of African descent, through the strength of her own story.","Throughout history, Zora can often be found on the frontier of African American accomplishments. In 1927, she was the first African American to be admitted to Barnard College. After graduation, Zora immediately set out to explore “Negro” folklore. Through her strong determination and interest- and after only a few months- Zora had amassed the largest collection of “Negro” folk tales in her field. She used her extensive research into African American life and history to construct plays which recalled traditional “Negro folk-lore.” One such play is her famous <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, an adaptation of <em>The Great day</em>, a theatrical revue- a theatrical performance involving short satirical and topical songs, sketches, and monologues- written in 1932.","Zora frequently worked with Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida to construct and perform her creations. The concert program of “Negro music” for <em>The Great Day </em>was built through Zora’s collaborative effort with the creative literature department of Rollins College. The John Golden Theatre on Broadway housed the first performance of <em>The Great Day</em> on January 10, 1932- Zora had made it to Broadway. On February 11, 1933, she staged an adaptation of <em>The Great Day</em> called <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, “a program of original Negro folk-lore,” at Rollins College with “Native Negro Singers and Actors.” The event program included a brief biography about Zora Hurston, an outline of the play, and specific descriptions and explanations of each song included in the revue. At 8:15 pm, “Negroes” and “white friends of the Negroes” gathered at Rollins’ Recreation Hall to “experience the richness of the material at their own doorstep.” The play was a success, as many college and local newspaper write-ups from the period suggest, and Zora continued to display her creations at Rollins in front of captive audiences for years to come.","Though she fought and stood against racial prejudice throughout her life, Zora Neale Hurston stands as one of America’s most celebrated authors.  Zora’s creative path began in Eatonville, and by the mid 30s, it brought her to all the way to Broadway. Her story stands to tell: Zora indeed took her mother’s advice to “jump at de sun.\""],"display_date":"1910 - 1935","search_date":"1922-12-31","locations":[{"id":16531,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":129,"tag":"Eatonville"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4857,"title":"Zora Neale Hurston: Impact on Music Folklore","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/39","end_date":"12/31/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Music belongs to all humans. Race, size, or color does not matter. When it comes to music, all cultures come together, one voice is heard. Folklore music is a prime example of this, and Zora Neale Hurston played an extremely important role in it. Not many African Americans had the opportunity to publish any type of works, or even to express their opinions on music, but Hurston was able to and represented all those who did not have the opportunity to do so. She introduced folklore and showed us how important music is, and the role it played in African American’s lives. <br /> Folklore music really represents cultures, their beliefs as well as religion. Much of music is written to express our feelings about certain topics, Africans viewed music as a getaway, they believed that through music they were able to achieve a lot more than by actually physically reacting to a certain issue. When music was made, spirits were lifted, and feelings were expressed; much of folklore music was played during special celebrations such as weddings and burials. It brought people together, and as Hurston mentioned “it does not belong to any special time, place, nor people”. Hurston taught us so much about the evolution of folklore here in Florida, and the role it played in both white’s and African’s lives. She once mentioned that a verse is “just a talking sentence,” to show us how powerful music was really is. To prove her point Hurston included in her book Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Vol. 12, No.1 fragments of folklore songs from various parts of Florida. These songs had powerful verses and stanzas that reached out to many, and painted a picture of what African American’s lives were like. <br /> Hurston often wrote about folklore music, but she also wrote “narratives and hoodoo practices.” She published many different books on music and its impact in states such as Florida, and Alabama; she also included examples of typical songs that were often popular among Africans in such regions. Her books were very descriptive and often told stories in form of songs about certain characters and their everyday lives. The characters portrayed in her books were mostly based on a non-fictional character; often people she knew and was close with. The songs reflected events that often took place in this person’s life, just told the story of their life. A perfect example of this would be Mules and Men, in which the “book really yields a valuable account of our Southern United States Negro.” <br /> Hurston’s books are known all over the country, and her works are greatly recognized in states such as Florida. History owes a great deal to Hurston, thanks to her we now know a great deal of how and what music folklore was influenced and how it was brought about here in our own Floridian backyards. We are also able to get a glimpse of what life was like during the slave trade periods, just as well as how, not only people were affected by slavery, but how culture and music were also impacted."," "," "," "],"display_date":1939,"search_date":"1939-07-02","locations":[{"id":23214,"lat":28.7169229525,"lng":-81.2362806752,"zoom":10,"place":"Seminole, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":471,"tag":"music"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4858,"title":"Zora Neale Hurston: Improving Race Relations through African Folklore","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"6/8/32","end_date":"10/10/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zora Neale Hurston made contributions to the acceptance of African Americans in society through her noteworthy folklore writing.  Hurston was an inhabitant of Florida, but resided in New York City when she wrote a letter to Professor Grover on June 8<sup>th</sup> 1932.[1]  In her letter, she explains that she majored in Anthropology at Columbia University.  Furthermore, she states “I have done three years research among my people and possibly I know as much about the matter as anyone else.”[2]  The overall point of Hurston’s letter to Professor Grover was a request to give a concert of Negro folklore to accurately represent African life.  Zora Neale Hurston had notable success in the North, but it would be an arduous task to raise awareness of African life and improve race relations in the South due to discrimination.","Hamilton Holt, president of Rollins College at the time wrote a letter to William Robert Wunsch an English instructor at Rollins College on November 1 1932.  In the letter, Hamilton Holt explains, “I see no reason why you should not put on in recreation hall the negro folk evening under the inspiration of Zora Hurston.”[3]  Holt indicates he does not want anything vulgar in the presentation.  Also, he makes note there should be no Negroes in the audience unless they are segregated, but still believes that would be unwise.[4]  Later in the letter, Hamilton Holt does not recommend advertising the event, but also claims he might be wrong by not advertising Zora Neale Hurston’s work.[5]  The negativity of some of Holt’s letter to Wunsch may seem misleading.  In reality, Hamilton Holt was eventually honored by the presence of Zora Neale Hurston on campus.[6]  It seemed clear he was just taking precaution of the radical change of having an African American at Rollins College due to the discrepancy between the perceived acceptance of blacks in the North and the South.  In fact, Hamilton Holt ended his letter to Wunsch stating, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”[7]  The direction Holt is referring to portrays better race relations between blacks and whites, and equality","Through the writing of the president of Rollins College in the 1930s, Hamilton Holt not only accepted but also embraced Hurston’s request.[8]  Hamilton Holt wrote, “I was very proud that Mr. Wunsch, Dr. Gover, and the others helped you, and Rollins will always be glad that we had some part in your success.”[9]  This quote alludes to the fact that highly educated African Americans are being accepted and embraced in the South and North, thus representing an improvement in race relations.  Holt goes on to compliment Hurston’s work, and show his support by suggesting Rollins will do everything in the college’s power to improve her success and happiness.[10]","Part of Zora Neale Hurston’s acknowledgement as an accepted member of society instead of just a black woman can partially be attributed to her experience at Rollins College.  Zora Neale Hurston became an extremely accomplished folklore writer, but more than that she was an incredibly productive member of African American society.  Through Hurston’s work and optimism, she enlightened whites of African culture, which ultimately proved an African American was being accepted in the populace through different regions of the United States."],"display_date":"June 8, 1932 -

W. France about her 1934 production of <em>All De Live Long Day</em>. Zora lived her life in an attempt to revitalize and find the truth behind her African American culture, which at the time was mostly represented elaborately and inaccurately. The majority of her work was presented from research she had done extensively because she wanted to recreate her findings as purely as possible. Through folktales, songs, folk plays, and dances, Zora was able to not only to identify her culture, but also show the world the artistic works of African-American people. A look into her past as an ethnographer as well as her experience with dance can help us understand why and how she wrote this production.","I find it important that there is an understanding that African American culture is influenced continuously and had been influenced since these shores were beached. Ever before Zora's time, hundred of factors have limited, scarred, undermined, and frightened Blacks in the United States. And along with this, their history had not been created by themselves, but by their white superiors of the time. People didn't make much effort to truly observe African American life and culture, and so misconstrued ideas about black folk art forms of the past were represented. But Zora could see through this. Being more than just a writer, dancer, or singer, her anthropological and ethnographic background opened her eyes onto peoples who were similar and heavily influenced the rapidly changing culture of African Americans. “Hurston had spent a relatively short but productive period in contact with the full roster of artists, intellectuals, and patrons of the Harlem Renaissance, drawing on her acquaintance with Southern black folklore for writing stories and for storytelling in social gatherings.” <sup><sup>2</sup></sup>","In reference to her approach in studying and arranging dance, Zora was a careful observer.","With particular concern about the ways in which commercialized depictions of blackness were being misconstrued as representative of African American life, Hurston set out to produce a concert that revealed in embodied form her own nuanced theory of black vernacular expression. At root, this theory sought to re-situate African American cultural products in relation to the material conditions of a Southern rural folk community, as well as to African diasporic roots and routes. <sup><sup>3</sup></sup>","She tried as best she could to immerse herself within the culture. The final act in<em> All De Live Long Day</em> is reenacts many different dances, including the Courtship dance, the Crow dance, and the Fire dance (which she was particularly fond of). These are not just a random assemblage of movements: each one has strong roots in African American culture. Her data and observations took place in looking at Caribbean dance, which is more unchanged from its origins. The Caribbeans and African Americans have long been connected and influential towards one another, beginning with the roots. And Zora didn't just observe, she participated with the people, learning the intricacies and feelings behind the dance.","The African American are a people who have had to deal with rapid change in status and ideologies. Because of this, it can be easy to look at what is considered to be historical and accept it as fact. But, when an elite and prejudiced group is the one setting things in stone, intentionally and unintentionally “facts” can be recorded incorrectly. Zora Neale Hurston is a woman who looked at her people with pride and therefore wanted to open the world to their truth. Though seemingly unimportant, songs, folklore and dance can help distinguish a people from another, showing the beauty in differences. A background in anthropology and writing allowed Nora to both put herself on level with those she was studying and correctly express it in such a way that is accurate and intricate. African American history has had its long and tedious battles, making it more than deserving of realistic representation.","1 Zora Neale Hurston “All De Live Long Day” Rollins College Archives (January, 1934)","2 Benigno Sánchez-Eppler “Telling Anthropology: Zora Neale Hurston and Gilberto Freyre Disciplined in Their Field-Home-Work,” <em>American Literary History</em>, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Autumn, 1992): 464-488","3 Anthea Kraut “Between Primitivism and Diaspora: The Dance Performances of Josephine Baker, Zora Neale Hurston, and Katherine Dunham,” <em>Theatre Journal</em>, Vol. 55, No. 3, Dance (Oct., 2003): 433-450"],"display_date":"January 1934","search_date":"1934-01-16","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":496,"tag":"Dance"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}}]}
