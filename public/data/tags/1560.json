Movements regarding the war in Vietnam, civil rights, and gay rights escalated as the United States entrenched itself in economic crises and political divisions. As these movements gained momentum, the political system as well as the prevailing social notions of the time attempted to quash any semblance of progressive thinking until the end of the decade. Three documentaries about the time - <em>The Weather Underground, Chisholm ’72,</em> and <em>The Times of Harvey Milk </em>- focus on the major political voices of the 1970s and how they were confronted, spurned, or ignored. By analyzing these three works, it can be deduced that the 70s were a period of social and political growth and examination in the youth and minority populations that the older generation of society was attempting to supplant with traditional Cold War values.","By 1970, the war in Vietnam had escalated and Nixon’s campaign of “Vietnamization” had begun. Under Nixon, the Vietnam War saw an increase in strategic bombings of supposed communist strongholds and the “incursion” into Cambodia with 25,000 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops. This increased activity in Indochina prompted a growth in the anti-war movement, which had already gained considerable momentum. Students for a Democratic Society - the major student body anti-war organization during the Vietnam War - was already at 300,000 members and growing. Privileged college students began to rebel over war crimes committed by the government under their pretext of protecting the world from communism.","The 2002 film <em>The Weather Underground</em> focused on the exploits of the Weathermen, a domestic insurgent agency formed in the summer of 1969. They were the militant arm of the SDS and sought to overthrow the United States government on account of the civilian casualties in Vietnam. With the slogan “Bring the War Home,” the thirty-odd Weathermen wanted to instill fear in the government that was controlled by, what they perceived, as old, corrupt politicians from an irrelevant, bygone generation. Nixon responded to this radical minority with reciprocal contempt. After the Greenwich Townhouse Explosion in May 1970, the Weathermen went underground and started a strategic bombing campaign, all the while being pursued by the FBI. After the war ended and many Weathermen came out of hiding, few went to prison on the account of the FBI’s illegal actions to track them down in the first place. Simultaneously, vice president Spiro Agnew denounced the anti-war protesters as “traitors, thieves and perverts.” It seemed the administration’s decision to marginalize the movement had adverse effects as the Weathermen’s coordinated bombings of government buildings skyrocketed until the end of the war in ’75. These practices, coupled with the release of the Pentagon Papers in ‘71, sewed seeds of distrust and frustration with how the government was conducting business not only in Vietnam, but also within the system itself. The prevailing Cold War policy of containment propagated in the 1950s and 1960s had permeated society as well as foreign policy. It was finally met with resistance in the 1970s to the dismay of Washington, and thus they made every attempt to stamp it out.","Like the Weathermen, the campaigning of Shirley Chisholm in the 1972 election was an indicator of a changing sociopolitical climate, but unlike the Weathermen, forces within the movement itself halted its momentum. The 2004 film <em>Chisholm ’72: Unbought & Unbossed</em> illustrated exactly how the Democratic Party was operating during the 1972 election and how massive and divided the party –and society - was against such a unified political platform as the Republicans’. Chisholm herself ran for the rights of women and African Americans but also for a withdrawal from Vietnam and the resolution of the busing integration controversy. However, her gender mixed with the color of her skin greatly hampered her support base as the male-dominated Black Panther party was reluctant to back her, as well as the feminist movement, which generally marginalized the voices of black women. By the time of the democratic nomination, all of Chisholm’s supporters in Congress like Ron Dellums ended up supporting George McGovern of South Dakota for the nomination. The 70s were showing signs of progressive, liberal attitudes, but were being hampered all the way by the established government. Nixon simply appealed to those sick of the costly New Deal social programs and won a landslide victory with 61 percent of the popular vote. It seems like all would be lost in terms of progressive ideals in the 1970s, but as the decade wore on and Nixon was impeached and resigned, people began to think that the established order could be openly challenged without severe repercussions.","Enter Harvey Milk: district 5 Supervisor of San Francisco in 1978. In the documentary <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em>, Milk’s exploits and contributions to the San Francisco gay community are revealed, along with the events that precipitated his assassination, and the subsequent outrage over the verdict of his killer. Reflecting the desperation of fellow supervisor Dan White who murdered both Milk and San Francisco mayor George Moscone, the established sociopolitical system of the United States by 1978 was buckling under the increasing momentum of liberal views and progressive ideals. Milk was one of many activists who were fighting tooth and nail for moral, social, and political equality. One of the major planks of the Democratic Party in the 1976 election was advocating of equal rights groups. President Carter publicly endorsed gay rights, which would have been impossible even earlier that decade. However, Milk and other activists’ primary opponent during this transitional period were evangelical fundamentalists who were still clinging to the old Cold War system of control. Milk’s crowning moment as Supervisor was his opposing of California Proposition 6, or the Briggs Initiative, which would ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools. Milk was able to rally public support against the bill and even get open support from prominent politicians like Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The main indicator for the closing of the decade, however, is Milk’s assassination itself. For a gay man to be put into a position of such power within the city of San Francisco, the people had to have been open to radical changes in infrastructure. Unfortunately, the last years of a dying system seem to be the most chaotic. In this case, Christian fundamentalism had a major resurgence, as people were fearful of the state of the established order. It was this resurgence that opposed Harvey Milk and went leniently on his killer Dan White, but the subsequent widespread outrage over the court verdict showed that they were becoming a shrinking minority.","Was the 70s characterized by repression and disengagement? Some would argue that it is, but the strength in the progressive organizations paved the way for an unprecedented amount of liberal thinking so far seen in the Cold War. The documentaries <em>The Weather Underground</em>, <em>Chisholm ’72</em>, and <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em>, showed a decade in transition, a transition hampered heavily by a system of political and societal control refined over thirty years of Cold War conflict. If that system had not been so heavily entrenched in the minds of America’s older citizens at that time, the 70s would have been a period of growth instead of repression and turmoil"],"display_date":"1970 - 1979","search_date":"1974-12-31","locations":[{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34445,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"},{"id":1561,"tag":"1972 Election"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5835,"title":"Gender in the 1970s: Women's Fashions","course_id":119,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/71","end_date":"12/31/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["With fine fabrics and linens that were “soft and sunswept”, Leedy’s on Park Avenue had clothes for “discriminating girls of all ages”[1]. This advertisement reflects the changes in women’s fashion in the 1970s. After the 1960s, known as a decade of peaceful, nonviolent reform movements, the 1970s brought changes in gender roles. Many women demanded equal rights and advocated for careers outside the home. Following the Title VII provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the National Organization for Women was formed in 1966 to help create equal partnership with men. Due to the increase of women working outside of the home in nontraditional work settings, the fashions of women’s clothing started to change. Women that were working in factory jobs obviously needed work clothes – clothes with heavy thread, strong zippers, rugged fabric and heavy-duty pockets. To meet this new demand, the world’s largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck, and Co., “has developed a line of women’s work clothing to take the place of the old clothes, sweatshirts, jeans and men’s work clothing”[2] that many women wore on the job. While miniskirts, makeup, and high heels were popular in the 1960s, many feminists in 1970s rejected the assumptions of feminine beauty and culture by cutting their hair and wearing jeans and pants. From the protest years of the 1960s “American women were no longer willing to follow the lead of fashion designers. Women wanted more than one look and seemed to thrive on choice”.[3] These changing fashions for women were a result from a feeling of repression as one woman explained that “women have been forced to dress as objects since the invention of patriarchy. Why are women forced to dress certain ways? Because our clothes help keep us oppressed. They are a constant reminder of our position”.[4]  In the 1970s, fashion designers introduced a new line of skirts known as the “midi” and “maxi” skirts that came down to women’s ankles and were meant to replace “miniskirts.” While this trend didn’t last long, clothing stores quickly brought back miniskirts, women’s rejection of the longer skirts, “implicitly illustrated that women ought to be able to dress as they pleased, even if the fashions they picked emphasized their sexuality rather than their feminine virtue”[5]. Although not all women changed their styles to button down shirts, jeans, and men’s boots, the transformation in how women dressed challenged how the American society in the 1970s viewed women."],"display_date":"1971 - 1979","search_date":"1975-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision- 1970s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":119,"school_id":5}},{"id":5843,"title":"The Rise of Divorce in Florida in the 1970s","course_id":119,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/78","end_date":"12/31/78","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Nationally, divorce rates climbed 82 percent during the decade of the 1970s, and in no state was this trend more apparent than in Florida. According to the 1978 records of the Vital Statistics of Florida (VSF), dissolutions of marriage (including annulments) reached an all-time high, while remaining below the 1975 divorce rate, at which it had peaked. The divorce ratio in 1978 was 7.4%, an increase from 7.2% in 1977, however still 0.1% shy of the 1975 peak ratio of 7.5%. Still, the table referenced in the VSF shows an overall increase in the frequency of marriage dissolutions through the 1970s. This growth is obvious when looking at the proportion of divorce in the 1970 (5.4%), compared to 7.4% in 1978. It is clear that within the span of 8 years, the rate of divorce in Florida grew by a substantial 2%.","Of course, the Florida State Board of Health offers several factors to be taken into consideration whilst evaluating the statistics concerning divorce. Many of the people whom establish residency in Florida do so solely for the purpose of taking advantage of the state's liberal divorce laws. This fact might account for the high frequency of divorce in Florida when compared to the national average. In 1978, for example, the ratio of dissolutions per 100 marriages in Florida was 69.3, whereas nationally, the ratio was far less, at only 50.3. Still, the State Board of Health predicts a decrease in the difference between these two ratios as other states become more liberal in their own divorce policies. When evaluating the number of marriage dissolutions in Florida, using the numbers collected over the years, the growing divorce trend becomes quite visible. In 1960, for example, 19,511 marriages were dissolved in Florida. By contrast, 37,202 marriages were dissolved in Florida a decade later, in 1970. And in 1978, 66,018 marriages were recorded as having been dissolved in the state of Florida. Given, the occurrence was rising more rapidly than the national average, but that is not to say that the national divorce rate had not been rising as well. In fact, the national divorce ratio had been following an upwards trajectory since 1963, and according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an estimated 1,130,000 divorces were granted in the US during 1978. This was 3.6% higher than the national divorce total for 1977. These statistics paint a clear picture as to the evolving social tendency towards divorce becoming a more frequent occurrence in 1970s America.","There are several logical inferences to make regarding these statistics, the most obvious being that divorce had become a more acceptable practice in US society during this decade. The significance of the rise of divorce in the United States is perhaps most evident in everyday family life. Such an increase in divorce alludes to the changing face of the typical American family during the 1970s. Average American adults during the 1970s probably knew more people who had been divorced, or re-married, than their parents had known. Having step-parents, or being a single mother was probably more common in the 1970s than it had been in the 1950s or 1960s. Regardless of the forces that fuelled this societal shift, the rising divorce rate, as documented in the 1978 Vital Statistics of Florida, clearly marks a change in the American landscape. The growth of dissolutions of marriages during the 1970s speaks to the transformative nature of the decade, and hints at the effect it had on the family dynamics of Americans."],"display_date":1978,"search_date":"1978-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"},{"id":527,"tag":"Divorce"},{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision- 1970s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":119,"school_id":5}}]}
