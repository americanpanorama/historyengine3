The game was between freshman and sophomores at Harvard College. In the 1820’s, on Ivy League campuses the earliest form of football was invented. Princeton began playing what was then known as ‘ballown’. Participants would use their fists to advance the ball, and then their feet, this game consisted mainly of one goal: to advance the ball past the opposing team. There were no hard and fast rules applied to this earliest attempt at the game we now call football. At Harvard University a tradition started known as Bloody Monday, a massive football type game between the freshman and sophomore classes. This was a brutal game that usually broke out into fights and riots on the campus and throughout Boston. Post Civil War the game began to increase in popularity in prep schools and cities throughout the northeast. But the big jump for football came in 1873, when representatives from five colleges met in New York City to formulate the first intercollegiate football rules for the increasingly popular game. The man behind this was Walter Camp who mad up the rules and scoring system for the game of football. Within a decade of play on university campuses, concern over the brutality of the game led to its ban by some colleges. There was a reported one hundred eighty players who had suffered serious injuries, and eighteen deaths from playing the game of football. The game was almost on the verge of extinction, but President Theodore Roosevelt called upon Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to help save football from demise. At a meeting between the schools, they agreed upon more rule changes. Then at their second meeting more than sixty schools showed up to help reform the game, and they appointed a seven member Rules Committee and set up what would later become known as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, or the NCAA. Because of this meeting life in America changed, football became America’s passion and weekends in the fall began to belong to football."," "],"display_date":"October 1900 - October 1920","search_date":"1910-10-16","locations":[{"id":49626,"lat":42.3511485836,"lng":-71.9050032885,"zoom":8,"place":"Worcester, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":264,"tag":"football"},{"id":265,"tag":"america"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":6074,"title":"Baseball: America's Greatest National Pastime","course_id":121,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-06-01","end_date":"1867-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As the Civil war drew to an end, it brought about the dawn of the game that would eventually be referred to as America’s “National Pastime.” According to the Baraboo Daily News, by 1867 baseball was pretty much organized and in full swing in the town of Baraboo, WI with much of the credit owed to the enthusiastic father of the game, George Dodd.","Baseball literally became the heart of little Baraboo, with its playing field in the very center of the town. Here, the people of Baraboo made memories and created history that is still shared today.  Like the day fans watched in awe as their very own Moore Hudson threw the very first fast pitch “like a bolt from the blue”.  Or the Baraboo boys most legendary and triumphant victory over their longtime Portage rivals.  Mr. Noyes pitched an excellent game that Fourth of July in 1976, and the colored catcher, who they called Johnson, with no protection and remarkable agility mastered the art of dodging the foul tips without letting his cigar leave it's spot between his lips.  It was an unforgettable day for Baraboo; it was an unforgettable game.","Every new-fangled pitch that developed with the passing years, from the fast ball to curve ball. Every time the incredible Le Grand Lippitt raced around the diamond in not much more than 13 seconds. Every time the crowd exploded as the crack of the legendary “Long Langdon’s” bat sent the ball soaring for a game winning homerun. This is what made the people of Baraboo fall in love with the game.  This is what made America fall in love with baseball.","The game changed over the years though.  Teams lost their “old-timers” from the roster and uniforms changed.  Although professional baseball started as a strictly white sport, African American’s started playing baseball in the mid 1800’s.  Players like Moses Fleetwood Walker and Bud Fowler finally made their way to inter-racial professional teams only to be rejected again by 1900; this eventually led to the founding of the Negro National League in 1920.  However, black players began creating their own teams and “barnstorming”, or challenging, any team willing to face them on the field. One of the most talented and well-known teams formed during this time was Robert P. Gilkerson’s very own Gilkerson Union Giants.  Though referred to as “those colored boys” and “the most comical aggregation ever assembled together”, the Giants swept across the country with an incredible series of victories.  During their 1921 season, the team came around that that home play a total of 916 times while their opposing teams scored just over 400 times.","Colored or not, America couldn’t ignore their astounding talent forever. On October 23, 1945 just 25 years after the Negro National League was formed and almost a century after American first discovered baseball, the Brooklyn Dodgers became the first ever Major League Team to recruit a black player: Jackie Robinson.  And so this began the uniting of leagues and the blurring of racial lines until all that was seen was players on the field who loved the game of baseball.","So yes, baseball transformed since 1867.  The rules in the book, the measurements on the field, the pitch coming off the mound, and even the color of the players on the roster have changed. From the Baraboo boys’ in 1867, to the barnstorming of the Gilkerson Union Giants in 1923; from the history changing Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers to the renowned Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers, it’s still the same game of baseball that makes America what it is today. And there is no doubt that baseball is still America’s greatest national pastime."],"display_date":"June 1867","search_date":"1867-06-15","locations":[{"id":15110,"lat":43.4268115625,"lng":-89.948369585,"zoom":9,"place":"SAUK, Wisconsin"}],"tags":[{"id":265,"tag":"america"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":233,"tag":"Baseball"}],"course":{"name":"Introduction to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":121,"school_id":68}},{"id":6674,"title":"The Lavender Scare: A Difficult Time Period for the LGBT Community in America","course_id":173,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" "," ","An excerpt from a Department of Commerce report, which was drafted on June fifteenth,1950 in response to the Federal Government’s report on suspected homosexual employees in the civil service, helps to provide insight about the conditions and treatment of homosexuals in the Civil Service during the period of time known as the “Lavender Scare (1945-1950’s) a time in which mass firings of individuals took place on the grounds that they were suspected to be homosexual. The report, titled “Perversion Cases- Department of Commerce” entails the procedure and process used to dismiss employees who were found to be “sexually perverted”. Once individuals were suspected or alleged to be homosexual, they were investigated thoroughly by their department and this investigation was then followed up by a personal hearing; if both the investigation and personal hearing were to indicate that the individual was in fact homosexual, they were immediately dismissed from their job (forced to resign). Overall, of the twenty-two individuals which were suspected to be homosexual by the Civil Service Commission, only one individual was found to have false charges against them, sixteen individuals had been or were in the process of being dismissed at the time this report was published and four individuals’ cases were pending decision. Individual cases outlining the forced resignation of employees are also described in this report; employees that were found to be homosexual after a thorough investigation and personal hearing were promptly dismissed. One such case describes the dismissal by retirement of an employee who had served the Department of Commerce for thirty-one years.","Throughout the 1950’s, the practice of firing alleged homosexual individuals was gradually becoming more and more widespread; mostly based on the belief that homosexuals and communists possessed common characteristics which included moral corruption and sexual perversion; these traits made them vulnerable and left them psychologically weak, and therefore, a national security threat; according to the likes of the McCarthy administration and other anti-gay commentators of the time. The instance outlined in the Department of Commerce report is one of many that resulted from what Andrea Friedman calls “the sexualisation of cold war politics” in her article on the manipulation of homosexuality as a political tactic during Joe McCarthy’s term as a senator. The crackdown on homosexual people, according to Friedman, was a result of growing sentiment to differentiate the loyal from the disloyal in which private relationships which were considered inappropriate and abnormal became synonymous with symbols of disloyalty and national betrayal. The use of this political tactic known as the “Lavender Scare” alongside the anti-communist sentiments of what is known as the “Red Scare” portrays the idea that both homosexuality and communism were closely linked in the minds of those who sought to perpetuate misconceptions for their political motivations in the unsure times of the Cold War. "," "," "],"display_date":"1950 - 1969","search_date":"1960-01-01","locations":[{"id":53040,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"USA"}],"tags":[{"id":3289,"tag":"Mass Firings"},{"id":3288,"tag":"Persecution"},{"id":584,"tag":"gay"},{"id":3287,"tag":"Lesbian"},{"id":3284,"tag":"Lavender Scare"},{"id":3286,"tag":"Mccarthyism"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":265,"tag":"america"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}},{"id":6743,"title":"The Threat on Jewish Culture in the Soviet Union","course_id":179,"status":"P","start_date":"10/27/66","end_date":"10/27/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late October of 1966, Mrs. Mortimer Jacobson returned home from the Soviet Union.[1] The head of Hassadah, or Women’s Zionist Organization of America led a group of 24 leaders who had approached the Soviet Union with an offer to send 500 Jewish students on scholarship to Israel. As Mrs. Jacobson put it, she wanted the children to “get a feel for the land of the Bible” something the group believed was becoming harder to do within the Soviet Union. Mrs. Jacobson holds a view that the “United States, Israel and the Soviet Union represented the future of Jewish life.” She especially emphasised that while a Moscow synagogue alone had 5,000 in attendance for the observation of Simhath Torah on October 7<sup>th</sup> once outside the synagogue proof of Jewish culture is much harder to find. A local Jewish leader objected to this notion citing the existence of a Jewish magazine and plays by a classic Jewish playwright being performed. Mrs. Jacobson however, countered this observation citing a lack of life history books and textbooks, in any language, on Israel or Hebrew in Moscow shops. The offer to send the children away was turned down by the government in a way that Mrs. Jacobson specifically mentioned had offended her.  A reluctance to send their children to the “decadent” West is mentioned, but no official reasoning is offered. Mrs. Jacobson asks for public protest to be a voice for the children. Left without a voice, the fate of their culture is left uncertain."," ","This article was run in 1966, two decades after the end of World War 2 and in the midst of a cold war between the Soviet Union and the West. In the years following the end of World War 2, the mistreatment of the Soviet Jewish population by Stalin became increasingly clear.[2] As activists and scholars tried to raise awareness of this injustice, financial support was received from the West.[3] This was not something which was favourably received by the Soviet Union, as seen in the rejection of these gifts following 1947 with an improvement in conditions in the Soviet Union being cited for the rejection.[4] A “witch hunt”, as Michael Beizer refers to it, could still be seen with an anti-Jewish propaganda campaign emerging, as well as an increase in the arrests of Soviet Jewish residents for “conspiracy against the Soviet regime”.[5]  These events, seen as a response to the American aid, only served to increase tensions between Soviet Jews, as many did not welcome the aid from their enemies.  Mrs. Jacobson and her peers hoped to save Jewish culture in the Soviet Union for future generations before it was too late.  Whether the Soviet Union government would allow them to was another question."," "," ","Bibliography"," ","Beizer, Michael. \"\"I Don't Know Whom to Thank\": The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee's Secret Aid to Soviet Jewry.\" <em>Jewish Social Studies</em> 15, no. 2 (2009): 111-136. <a href=\"https://muse.jhu.edu/\">https://muse.jhu.edu/</a> (accessed October 21, 2017)."," ","Golden, Peter. “Saving the Jews of the Soviet Union.

For example, women pushed desperately to pass the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment (1933) repealing the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment (1919); prohibition. While previous women desperately fought to create the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, none of them truly sought through the possible consequences its implementation could entail. Hence, a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was sought not long after.","            The initial plan women created, the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, was in attempt to “take back the home”. What I mean by this is that women believed that alcohol was the cause for their husbands being drawn away from the home all day, only to come home late and do very awful things to her.[1] In addition to this, women who were suffering from drunken husbands teamed up with the groups of religious people such as the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and males who could vote.[2] With strong effort they were able to successfully pass the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Over the years following, some women continued to celebrate while others began to see a change in light.","            The reason for this is as follows. While alcohol became illegal to sell, it did not prevent people from getting their hands on it and consuming it anyways. Another thing women noticed after the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment was that bars were no longer regulated. This meant they could stay open however late they please and let whom ever they want in. This allowed for the creation of “speak easies” which were basically the old bars but were now being used primarily for illegal actions such as selling black market alcohol. Some other things came from this as well.[3] These included an increase of prostitution, increase in youth drinking, increase in political/government corruption, increase in death, and also did not put an end to most husband’s violent actions.","            Because of these consequences, it was time for action, and action came in the form of a group of strong-willed women. For example, The WONPR, Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, was a women’s organization in support of the soon to be 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Importantly to note, this organization did not want to segregate political parties or previous movement organizations. Due to this, WONPR claimed over 1.2 million members at the beginning of 1933. One thing this organization campaigned on was “the repeal of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment is not defeat”.[4] This was in attempt to show 18<sup>th</sup> amendment prohibition supporters that their actions were in good means, and that it is not a loss but rather a creation for a better, safer way.","Another organization of powerful women who played a role in the creation of the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was the Women’s Organization for Prohibition Reform. For example, Ione Nicoll, secretary of WOPR, saw the destruction of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment and began to look for ways to repeal it. Nicoll frequently brought up that instead of eradicating the evils people faced, prohibition made it worse.[5] To further show her reasonings for why women “should vote wet”, Nicoll explained a study done in 1925 by the Women’s National Republican Club. This study concluded that out of the vast variety of women they surveyed, ninety percent voted to get rid of or make changes to the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Not only did she use facts to back up her reasonings for a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment, she also tried to get female Prohibitionists on her side like the WONPR did.","Though some of the Prohibition supporters were scarred by experiences, others began to see a new light that shined on the creation of a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Overtime these groups of women were able to gain mass support and became successful at repealing prohibition. With one of the campaign tactics being creating alliances, women in the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment were able to get the government, as well as others, on their side. Once this occurred, rapid changes began and the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was created."," "," ","Reference List:","Nicoll, Ione. \"Should Women Vote Wet?\" <em>The North American Review</em> 229, no. 5 (1930): 561-65. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.\">http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.</a>","Rose, Kenneth D. 1996.
