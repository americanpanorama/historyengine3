Cherrington was an educational pamphlet written in the early 1900’s. Dr. Cherrington questions the principles of prohibition. He was a general secretary with the World League against Alcohol; he raises questions about people who question prohibition. He doesn’t understand why the people who are against prohibition still wanted regulation in other systems. He wrote the article to point out and raise interesting questions related to the rules of alcohol. He questioned the laws concerning the age of legal alcohol consumption the amount and even questioned why it’s ok to sell it at 9:15 but not at 9:30. Dr Cherrington was clearly against alcohol and likely wrote this article because of the popularity and abuse of alcohol at that time was running high. He felt that alcohol was an important issue to address.","            Prohibition was the practice of prohibiting the transportation, sales, manufacturing, importing and exporting alcohol. In 1919 the United States passed the national prohibition act and the battle began between the “dry & wet”, meaning alcohol or no alcohol. The battle between these two groups had been going on since the 19<sup>th</sup> Century.  Alcohol played a major role and was a huge part in American history. Going back into history even the immigrants and settlers made their own liquor that included beer and wine. Even when the immigrants came to America they traveled and bought alcohol into the United States. Alcohol became a huge part in American society and contributed to the economy a great deal. Farmers were happy because they profited by making and selling alcohol from the barley they grew. It became a favorite hobby for some people and considered alcohol as a favorite pastime. Alcohol caused good and bad during the progressive era (1890-1920), it helped the economy on the good side and caused hostility on the bad side. There were many people against alcohol hence all the supporters of prohibition. Alcohol caused hostility in saloons and shops opened up crime in the black market and effected people’s health. On the other side of the coin alcohol contributed to fun times for people, a hobby to relax and let off steam from a hard days work or just meeting up with friends.  ","Christian evangelicals in 1910 were among the groups who were against alcohol. They took action in there own ways during their quest for prohibition. Because there were so many against and felt strong about the effects of alcohol they joined forces and used various types of propaganda against alcohol. There were songs, poems, pamphlets, and posters trying to prove to the public that alcohol is harmful. One of the most influential propagandas from the evangelicals was the posters because they presented a clear visual message that had gotten across the public. Even though they tried so hard to get their messages across their information did not influence the public as they thought. The public enjoyed alcohol and chose to ignore the messages. Just proves that the truth at the time wasn’t a concern to the public when it came to the physical and mental effects alcohol could cause in a person.","            People in the United States questioned and opposed prohibition in many ways. Dr. Cherrington raised good points. If you are against prohibition then why make rules such as limitations of how much alcohol can be purchased at once or how old is the right age to drink. Dr. Cherrington feels that the rules made in regards to alcohol were made without putting much thought into it. He feels that prohibition is the answer and adding laws to alcohol will not change the way alcohol is consumed"],"display_date":"1900 - 1919","search_date":"1909-12-31","locations":[{"id":52373,"lat":46.2975453728,"lng":-117.907874423,"zoom":9,"place":"Columbia, Washington"},{"id":50175,"lat":39.4276655911,"lng":-84.1668444718,"zoom":10,"place":"Warren, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5788,"title":"\"What!

Rob A Poor man of his Beer!\" and the meaning behind the words contained within that were written by \"Mr. John Barleycorn Jr.\". The name of the author appears to be a fictitcious name that was used by the anonymous writer of the pamphlet to personify alcohol and to better get his point across. The article was published for the use of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union.","Organizations such as the Women's National Christian Temperance Union were key players in the fight for national Prohibition of alcohol and utilized documents such as \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" to get their message across to readers. The exact date of the pamphlets publication is not noted in the document, but it was created by the National Temperance Society and Publication House in New York sometime between December 24th 1873 when the first protest by the Temperance group occurred to prior to the January 16th, 1920, adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment which prohibited the sale and distribution of alcohol.","The document is a poem that describes the possible pitfalls of alcohol consumption and attempts to focus on the important negative aspects of the consequences of its use such as the financial strain, domestic violence, and immoral behavior that its abuse promotes. It is obvious that the document is a pro-Prohibition document that was designed to enlighten the reader and was used as a tool by the Christian Temperance Union to gain support for a nationwide ban on alcohol production.","The pamphlet points out how much money is wasted on alcohol consumption that could be used to improve the lives of the families that it affects. It places a great deal of emphasis upon how funds are wasted in the saloons that could be better the economic situations for many families. This was a definite concern during those times.","As stated in the poem \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" there is mention of a few examples of the type of financial issues that alcoholic abuse contributed to. One such example was mentioned in this statement \"Of ten thousand dollars paid upon the spot, two-thirds was paid directly to the saloons.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This statement alone proves that alcoholism was a major cause for economic problems that were hurting the economy of families across the nation. Violence is also hinted towards in the pamphlet.","There are several lines in the poem which point out alcohol as being the reason for violence in the family. One such line states \"What! Rob a Poor man of his ale, and prevent him from beating his wife.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This one line speaks of how violence in the family directed towards women was a serious issue and a justification for Prohibition to be ratified. It is clear from such statements that the author wanted to alert readers that domestic abuse occurred when intoxicated husbands returned home from a night out at the saloon.","Overall the document is a perfect example of how organizations got their message across in regard to their views on Prohibition during an era when print media was the only way to spread information and influence public opinion. The pamphlet's author utilized a poem to explain the downfalls of alcoholism and more importantly promoted and drew attention to the benefits of a dry nation. It was also a way to deliver a message to the general population in a language that everyone could understand at that time. This is clear in the simplistic, informative, but also somewhat entertaining, way that the author attempts to get the attention of the reader by his or her use of a poetic form of writing."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 24, 1873","search_date":"1873-12-24","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1840,"tag":"Womens Temperance"},{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}}]}
