Henry Wirz came to America from Switzerland in 1849.  He settled in Louisiana and worked as a doctor to slaves on a plantation.  At the beginning of the Civil War, he joined the Fourth Louisiana Infantry and fought for about a year before he was wounded and lost most of the use of his right arm.  Since he could not fight, the army reassigned him to work at a couple of prisons and he eventually became emissary of Jefferson Davis to Europe.  After a year in Europe, Wirz came back and was made commandant of the Andersonville Prison in Georgia.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andersonville was known for being a particularly brutal prison.  Prisoners were not given enough food, and many prisoners died of starvation.  Disease also ran rampant.  In addition to these problems, gangs of raiders' within the prison bullied and beat other prisoners for money and possessions.  The Union Army arrived at Andersonville in May 1865 and they, as well as the public, were shocked by the atrocities of the prison and wanted to punish someone for these crimes.  Wirz was made the scapegoat and arrested on May 6.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His trial by a military commission began on August 23 and he was found guilty on October 24.  He was hung at the Old Capitol Prison on November 10, 1865.  Prisoners and other guards gave many differing accounts of Wirz's character.  Some made him out to be a kind-hearted, compassionate man, and others made him seem evil.

Born in a backwoods area in the Carolinas, Jackson served during the American Revolution and eventually ended up as a lawyer in Tennessee.  His later distinguished military career included the Tennessee militia, the War of 1812, and exploits dealing with and removing the Creeks, Seminoles, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws in the South, which gave him his heroic public image and his renown as an Indian fighter.  The Jacksonian Era of American politics (generally between the War of 1812 and the Civil War) was named for him.  President Jackson sympathized with Southern feelings yet denounced nullification as treason' during the nullification crisis because of his support of federalism and keeping the Union, opposed the National Bank, and, with his Maysville Road Bill veto, added federal support to road construction while at the same time conceding to states' rights and not alienating those who supported internal improvements.&lt;br /&gt;An Ohio statesman attributed President Jackson's popularity to his focus on the common man and characteristics of his personality: There is one remarkable trait about the character of General Jackson that endears him to the people.  It is the secret of his great and overpowering popularity.  We allude to the warm and ardent feelings for the laboring masses of mankind.  His whole soul has always been directed to their freedom from the oppressions of corporate wealth and aristocratic rule.  A more sincere, devoted, and ardent friend they never can have.  In him the working man was truly represented.

Immediately following the incident, one newspaper reported, his condition is very favorable,' while others lamented that his wounds are so bad.' As a result of the shot, doctors were forced to amputate his arm at the shoulder. He spent the next few days traveling to Richmond, but his condition worsened, and on May 10 at quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon, Jackson died.&lt;br /&gt;Jackson was a native of Virginia, and quickly rose through the ranks of the army. Although he had resigned his commission, the secession of Virginia brought him back into service to lead a regiment. He rose to prominence during the Civil War at the Battle of Manassas, and was a shrewd commander and brilliant tactician. A highly outnumbered Confederate army was prepared to retreat, but Jackson encouraged his comrade Gen. Bee to give [the Union army] the bayonet.' Bee then gave Jackson his nickname, telling his troops, There is Jackson, standing like a stone wall.'&lt;br /&gt;His death a serious blow to Confederate morale, and the entire Confederate force felt saddened by his look. However, his influence reached farther than his troops and the entirety of the Confederate States of America was saddened. A soldier in South Carolina wrote, Virginia, we weep with thee. Thou hadst no nobler son,' commenting that Jackson was on his way to share immortal bliss on high, near God's eternal Throne.' The New Orleans Daily Picayune recognized that Jackson was more than a general: Nor was he great only as a Soldier he was a Christian, a man of kindly feelings;his private character was beyond the reach even of reproach.' In Charleston, he was lauded as a Christian warrior and hero,' a venerated and distinguished friend,' and a veteran patriot and hero.' Throughout the South, Jackson was a beloved general, and his death cast a large shadow for many. Jackson's death was so important that it halted life in Richmond the day that his body arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Lee was among the most saddened at Jackson's death, regarding him as his ablest assistant. Announcing the death to his troops, Lee opined that Jackson's spirit still lives, and will inspire the whole army.' Harper's Weekly called Jackson the ablest officer in the rebel army.' Generals on both sides considered it a huge boost to the Union's war effort. Charleston newspapers recognized his death as an overwhelming calamity.'

At the beginning of 1899, State health official, W.T. Blunt, ordered drastic measures- house-to-house vaccination, fumigation and burning of all personal effects suspected of contamination- to be taken to control the smallpox epidemic. However, by March 16, conditions had grown worse rather than better, so Blunt was ordered to the region to spearhead the effort. However, a group of Laredo residents, largely Mexican American, refused to comply with Blunt's instructions, leading Blunt to call in the Texas Rangers to assist in the implementation of his orders. On March 19, the Rangers arrived, and commenced using forceful tactics against those suspected of having the disease. The citizens took to the streets in protest and began hurling rocks at the Rangers, prompting them to shoot into the crowd, wounding at least one man. The following day, a report was made to the local sheriff that a large order of buckshot had been made in that area of the city. The investigation led Sheriff Ortiz to the home of Agapito Herrera where, after brief negotiations, a gun battle ensued between the police and a group of armed men inside Herrera's home. Herrera was fatally shot and several others on both sides were wounded. After evacuating their injured officer, the rangers returned to find an armed crowd surrounding Herrera's body and another shootout followed. Throughout the night, gunfire could be heard throughout the surrounding neighborhoods. Finally, on the morning of March 21, backups from the US Cavalry arrived and restored peace. In the following days, work continued to try to control the smallpox epidemic and twenty-one people suspected of involvement in the riot were arrested. &lt;br /&gt;          Smallpox and other diseases were still rampant at the end of the 19th century. A Richmond Dispatch article from January of 1899 reports that smallpox had broken out in Mississippi, Alabama and, likely, in Tennessee and Georgia, as well. These diseases often affected minority groups disproportionately because their substandard economic situation and inferior living conditions made them more susceptible to illness. Disease was the leading killer in the Spanish-American War, killing nearly 5,000 US soldiers. In fact, the majority of casualties were suffered after the fighting had ceased.&lt;br /&gt;          Efforts were being made by scientists to cure these diseases and by officials to help citizens do whatever they could to avoid them. An anatomy exam from the University of Virginia in May of 1899 asked students to describe in detail such parts of the body as the skull, certain bones, ligaments, joints, several different muscle groups, the kidney, the pancreas, the cerebrum, the heart, and several different nerves. This illustrates that universities were working hard to educate students about the intricate workings of the human body. Extensive work was done by doctors and scientists during the Spanish-&lt;br /&gt;American war to discover how diseases spread. Walter Reed, an American Army surgeon was able to prove that yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. He would go on in 1900 to create a vaccine for yellow fever. And, like in Texas, when officials in North Carolina discovered a method they thought could fight disease, they used the law to enforce cooperation with their plan. On May 3 they issued an ordinance making vaccination against smallpox compulsory, threatening to fine those who did not comply. Disease was a powerful killer throughout the nineteenth century and, while steps were being taken to understand the spread of disease and to stop it where they could, officials and scientists still could not prevent outbreaks and citizens still resisted their attempts to impose unwelcome policies upon them."],"display_date":"March 19, 1899 - March 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-20","locations":[{"id":13306,"lat":27.8795150762,"lng":-99.636805503,"zoom":8,"place":"WEBB, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":165,"title":"William Henson sentenced to death.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-04-27","end_date":"1827-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27th, 1827 a verdict was reached in the William Henson case.  The court convicted this free black for forcibly breaking into a house and stealing items of a small value.'  His punishment was death, to be carried out on May 3rd.  This punishment was certainly extreme for such a petty offense, but the court was using what was called the Bloody Act of 1806.  This act as the Raleigh Register explained it said: any person shall break into any dwelling house, shop, warehouse or other outhouse thereto belonging and feloniously take away any money, goods, or chattels of the value of 20 schillings or upwards;shall suffer death without the benefit of clergy'.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henson's skin color certainly did not help his case, but surprisingly the Raleigh Register actually took to the defense of William Henson.  They did not however, come to the obvious conclusion that this act was utilized mainly because of Henson's pigmentation, but instead took it from the fear that any man (particularly white) might be tried under this obscure yet existing law.  People were advocating that although laws needed to exist to curtail crime, they must be equal to the crime.  The Register put it best when it said: Again and again we repeat, let a penitentiary be established'.  People wanted peace, but not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This occurrence shows two strains that mark the South throughout the nineteenth century.  One, that there was a double set of standards for the free black and the white male (even the poorest of whites).  Henson was the sacrificial lamb towards a political movement towards prison reform, not discrimination.  Second, that the entire justice system of the 1800's would undergo drastic changes during this time period from a place of punishment to a place of reform.  It would bring men like de Tocqueville from France to come to the United States and report on this new prison system in 1831.  Therefore, one can see that in many ways 1827 differed from current times but yet it maintained a battle over security vs. freedom that is still being debated to this very day."],"display_date":"April 27, 1827 - May 3, 1827","search_date":"1827-04-30","locations":[{"id":9840,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":171,"title":"Article about the Execution of a Rebel Spy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-06","end_date":"1864-01-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The same article was printed twice (in the Charleston Mercury and the Southern Recorder) regarding the execution of a twenty-one year-old rebel spy named Samuel Davis.

Johnson describes his experiences in an army camp in Florida during the previous summer of 1898. Johnson's friend, Julius E. Boggs, forwarded the letter to the Charleston newspaper, the News and Courier, where it was published on June 18, 1899. Johnson volunteered for the army when the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898 and was enlisted into the first South Carolina regiment that came to be stationed in Georgia and Florida. After this conflict was over, Johnson's regiment was mustered out, but he joined a regiment from his native Tennessee and, in 1899, was stationed on an island in the Philippines. This is where he wrote his letter from in April of that year. &lt;br /&gt;Johnson's letter describes the monotony of his life in camp until he stumbles upon one of the glaring inadequacies of the US military. Johnson became curious about the hospital at his camp and goes there one day only to discover that it was horribly understaffed, that nurses were catching diseases from sick soldiers and that patients were being kept in despicable conditions. Johnson immediately offered to lend a hand in the hospital and went on to fight his commanders in an attempt to improve the facilities. His story is a compelling tale of the struggles he and his fellow soldiers faced, even within the borders of the US. &lt;br /&gt;Other first hand accounts of what life was like as a soldier have also survived to this day. A collection of papers of the Fauntleroy family contain Mr. James Dearing Fauntleroy's records of his days spent at Camp Meade, Pennsylvania. Mr. Fauntleroy was an engineer from Campbell County, Virginia. His papers detail his correspondence with Office of Ordinance Officer for the Headquarter of the East wing of the United States Army cataloguing his requests for supplies while stationed at Camp Meade. One telegram from the summer of 1899 states that Mr. Fauntleroy requested one thousand meat cans, tin cups, knives, forks, spoons, one thousand haversacks and several other miscellaneous items from the New York Arsenal. &lt;br /&gt;While the Fauntleroy papers illustrate the everyday routines and Johnson's letter describes what it was like to be stationed within the US, newspapers from 1899 give much more dramatic portrayals of what soldiers in Cuba and the Philippines were experiencing. Many local papers ran daily columns covering the activities of their town's regiments. The Richmond Dispatch's With the Fourth' gave everyday updates on the fourth regiment of Virginia, which was serving in Cuba in the winter of 1898-99. Their articles could at times be suspiciously upbeat: It is remarked by those who are in a position to know that the regiment is in better shape than any in the Seventh Army Corps in health, strength, and tactical efficiency'. But, ultimately Americans at home wanted to know what their sons, brothers, fathers and husbands were seeing and doing in the wars of the 1890s."],"display_date":"April 23, 1899","search_date":"1899-04-23","locations":[{"id":1330,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":186,"title":"Death of Frederick Douglass\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-02-20","end_date":"1895-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 20, 1895, after attending a women's rights meeting, Frederick Douglass was struck by a heart attack and died at the age of 77.

Other shipping firms followed suit.  The firms, which appealed to the US Courts for protection, claimed that they hired blacks, not because they would work for lower wages, but because the central issue was simply and solely one of whether merchants of New Orleans shall conduct their own business in their own way, or whether they shall be dictated to by a handful of employees.'  &lt;br /&gt;On March 11, 1895, white laborers in New Orleans upset by the labor situation,' decided to go uptown to where the blacks worked.  The crowd was stopped by police who had been watching the distressed laborers.  A reported for the Atlanta Constitution claimed that an hour after the dispersal of the white laborers, a shot was fired which struck a black laborer, Philip L. Fisher, in the back.    The following day, two riots over a disagreement over the loading of cotton vessels occurred in the city under a presumably arranged plan.

The black workers slowly trickled back to work over the course of the month under the watchful eyes of the State Militia.

The proclamation details the danger of leaving water to lay stagnant on one's property because of the risk of mosquito born diseases like yellow Fever and malaria.  The mayor states that the city has gone to considerable expense to remove stagnant water from public lands, but in order to more adequately protect the city from the risk of disease, private land owners must take responsibility for clearing the water off of their lands.  For the white population of the town to remain healthy during the warm, humid summer months, citizens must aid the government in keeping the mosquitoes that carry yellow fever and malaria at bay.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically the warning neglects to mention the necessity of keeping the areas inhabited by slaves free from mosquitoes.  This absence of concern probably comes from the widely accepted belief that blacks possessed immunity to both the common mosquito born diseases of the era.  The white population also believed that mosquitoes only bit during the night, thus day time contact with black people did not pose a threat, and since the two races slept in completely different areas nighttime contact with the stagnate waters in slave areas did not pose a threat to masters and their families.  African-Americans possessed a degree of immunity from childhood encounters with the disease, but they still became mildly ill when exposed to the disease later in life.  The belief that slaves possessed immunity to yellow fever and malaria probably helped support the view of African-Americans as lazy.

The intent had been to lynch a black woman named Frances Woodson.  The crowd, composed of six young men in the community went to the woman's house, but she, having heard the threats against her life, had left.  The pack of young lynchers entered her house by breaking in the kitchen door.  Once inside, they destroyed the interior and set fire to the house.  The men were recognized by neighbors as they ran away.  &lt;br /&gt;White citizens of Gretna organized themselves in determination to lynch the gang of white men.

In Louisiana, New Orleans suffered greatly while Galveston, San Antonio, and Houston were three of the hardest hit cities in Texas.  In both states, epidemics of yellow fever had been occurring for years.  Indeed, from 1839 until 1867, Texas battled through several outbreaks of yellow fever.  Likewise, New Orleans experienced their first recorded outbreak of yellow fever in 1804 and subsequently struggled with epidemics until scientific breakthroughs curbed the spread of the disease in the early twentieth century.   In order to understand why these geographic locales were infected, one must understand yellow fever as a disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Walter Reed is attributed with having discovered that mosquitoes transmitted yellow fever during the building of the Panama Canal, the roots of this discovery reach back farther than 1900.  The Cuban physician Carlos Juan Finlay suggested as early as 1879 that yellow fever might be spread through some agent, rather than as a communicable disease.  Ultimately, it was not until the military funded research that Reed isolated the mosquito as the carrier of yellow fever virus.  Throughout the period when Louisiana and Texas suffered their worst outbreaks, it was assumed that yellow fever was an infectious disease.  Thus, in Texas, the Howard Association set up clinics to try and cure' those who fell ill.  This was a futile effort, considering that no reliable treatment actually existed at this point in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texas' 1867 outbreak marks the last of the major struggles with yellow fever in the state.

Casual articles with headlines like A Rascal Lynched' were fairly common in the newspapers of the 1870s; already, much of the Southern public was blinded with fear and rage at the idea of a black man with a white woman.  A lynching was most likely to occur in cases where a black man had been convicted of outraging' (raping) a white woman, though a lack of conviction did not mean whites presupposed an accused negro's innocence.  In Cairo, Mississippi, for example, a black man arrested for attempted rape of a white girl was taken from the jailhouse by a number of citizens and hanged.'  Threats of extralegal executions for black men were accepted as almost normal when a white woman's integrity and supposed virginity were at stake; many newspaper accounts failed to even mention the suspect's name.  A one-sentence account in the Richmond Daily Dispatch relayed a Mason County, Kentucky incident: A negro was shot dead in Mason County yesterday for rape.'  &lt;br /&gt;But why did rape merit the death penalty only in cases where the accused was black and the victim was a white woman? The Civil War ripped apart the Southern social structure; white men were no longer the unquestioned masters of their region.  The threat of white-black racial amalgamation coupled with post-slavery black competition in social and economic spheres struck fear into the hearts of white men across the South and compelled them to reassert their power over both their' women and the black men who were their competition. During Reconstruction, scattered incidents of lynching foreshadowed its exponential rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Lynchings in 1873 and those that occurred 2 decades later differed only in their frequency and intensity.  By the last decade of the nineteenth century, lynching had become the ultimate public expression of white male dominance, complete with cameras, newspaper announcements, and special excursion trains chartered for urban whites to view the ritual and extended torture of African-American men and even women in rural areas."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":5125,"lat":38.5951990256,"lng":-83.8240569898,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":365,"title":"Kentucky swears in John Larue Helm as Governor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-09-03","end_date":"1867-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1867 gubernatorial election in Kentucky offered an opportunity for black voters to participate in the selection of a governor.

The passenger train apparently ran under no such order and continued toward Ivanhoe.  The trains came around a curve and collided with each other.

After the end of the Civil War, Texas cattle ranchers began shipping their calves to markets in the north to be sold. Northern ranchers began to realize, however, that whenever the southern' cattle, cattle raised in pre-Civil War slave states, came into contact with northern cattle, disease broke out among the northern cattle within a few weeks, killing almost every animal afflicted. A letter to the editor of the Chicago Tribune in June of 1868 illustrates the fears of northern cattlemen, informing them that While at Centralia, yesterday, I saw a very long train of stock cars filled with Texas and Indiana oxen on their way to Iroquois County . . . there were in the lot fourteen hundred head of old, worn-out oxen, bringing the Spanish fever with them. A writer in the Missouri Democrat has described this disease as contagious, and says that it causes the destruction of our home cattle wherever these Texas cattle are taken' (2). Blaming Texas cattle entirely for the problem, Midwestern states passed quarantine laws to keep Texas cattle from passing through their state lines in an effort to protect their herds from the fatal disease. By prohibiting Texas cattle from passing through their states, Midwesterners also got a hand up on the cattle market because Texans had to put more time and effort into finding new routes to where they needed to take their cattle.  &lt;br /&gt;Studies were done on the afflicted cattle and in 1893 Theobald Smith and Fred Lucius Kilborne published the results of their study on the Texas fever, conducted at the federal Bureau of Animal Industry. Smith and Kilbourne found that the disease was most likely caused by a parasite called Pyrosoma bigeminum, which lived in and killed red blood cells. They believed that the disease was likely spread by cattle ticks, a theory previous medical men had dismissed as absurd. Smith and Kilbourne went on to differentiate between two different types of the disease, as well as to conclude that southern cattle acquired immunities to the disease early in life and, therefore, were not affected. &lt;br /&gt;The coincidence of the border of slave and free states being the same as the border between cattle afflicted by the disease and cattle not afflicted by the disease caused many northerners in the antebellum period to blame the southern lifestyle as the cause of their diseased cattle. Smith and Kilbourne's research helped to displace this false theory in the late 1800's, and thus help displace northern and southern stereotypes that may be made today."],"display_date":"June 1893","search_date":"1893-06-15","locations":[{"id":14347,"lat":36.7220692336,"lng":-81.9642215133,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":752,"title":"Lynching of Henry Smith\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-01","end_date":"1893-02-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 1, 1893 in Paris, Texas, Henry Smith was tortured and burned on a ten-foot high platform surrounded by an audience of thousands.

In Lynchburg, the rising waters destroyed many key bridges connecting sides of the James River.  In addition, ships all across the Atlantic coast were destroyed.  The canal system for commerce was greatly damaged by this and other floods and eventually actually needed to be replaced by the railroad system because of such extensive damage.&lt;br /&gt;In Baltimore, the flow of water through the Eastern part of the city was especially rapid, and rendered many well-traveled street crossings impassable. A pile of lumber was blown down the corner of the Eastern Avenue and Union Dock and completely obstructed the street.  In the nation's capital, the torrential downpour also produced serious damage.  In the early morning hours of October 4th, for example, the constant rainfall successfully dislodged nearly one half of the marble ceiling of the D.C.

The Lynchburg Virginian, for example, included a very perfunctory and minimal for-telling of the hurricane on the morning of October 3rd, as it only announced the coming of increasing winds;and cloudiness;followed by rain areas.'  Moreover, the Richmond Dispatch, and once the destruction had already begun, issued on October 4th only the report that the weather on the 3rd was cloudy, warm, and threatening.'

The formally-educated physicians warned the public about the dangers of medical quacks by publishing articles in Houston newspapers. Finally, in 1853, they formed the Texas Medical Association in order to set a quality standard for medical practice. The United States Senate later took notice of the Texas Medical Association when its president, a Mr. Spencer asked for the Senate to pass a law that would protect Texas physicians in the United States Navy. He claimed that doctors in the Navy had been given random and unnecessary orders by their superior officers.

Not only did the city have to contend with an outbreak of yellow fever, but cholera broke out as well.  Most likely, the appalling sanitation system in New Orleans contributed to it.

Most of the mortalities occurred among the immigrant community who likely had no access to proper drinking water.  Cholera also struck New Orleans poor, free blacks, who lived in filthy and cramped rooms. &lt;br /&gt;Not much was known about either yellow fever or cholera in 1853.  In fact, physicians believed that cholera was transported through the air simply because victims of cholera claimed that they had trouble breathing.  This false belief was carried out to the extreme.  No one was willing to nurse the victims of cholera back to health for fear of catching the airborne' disease.  Therefore, many victims died alone in their homes.  Fearful citizens would burn tar in the streets to create a thick smoke which they believed might help eradicate the infection from the air.  Stray animals were also believed to be vectors of infection, and people would let the dead bodies of the animals decompose in the street instead of removing the bodies for fear of contracting cholera.  &lt;br /&gt; One interesting remedy' for cholera was alcohol consumption.  This was particularly interesting in a time when the subject of temperance was so hotly debated.  Women and even children would imbibe spirits because it was believed that it would cure cholera.  The tragedy was that cholera was spread through drinking- not drinking alcohol, but drinking water.  Cholera traveled in rivers and into public drinking water.

As a result of the limited capabilities of medical science at the time and inaction on the part of city officials, yellow fever claimed thousands of lives.

Although the causes of the outbreak were uncertain at the time, many people pointed out that the spread of the fever was aided by the lack of adequate sewage system in the city of Memphis. The outbreak of 1879 came on the heels of the yellow fever outbreak of 1878 in which almost 90% of Memphis's 20,000 residents became infected, and fully one quarter died.

A vast fire, on the lot belonging to the estate of Isaac Fell, in Baptist Church square (Arkansas Gazette 4/1),' struck in the early morning of January 11, 1820. It spread with the winds and destroyed about 500 buildings before subsiding that afternoon.

This number was later revised by the Committee of Aldermen and Citizens of Savannah, who reported the amount claimed for losses as closer to one million dollars , still an immense sum in the early nineteenth century (Southern).  Because the fire had such a devastating effect on the Savannah and its citizens, people across the nation responded to aid those affected.  A committee was established to distribute clothing, food, and other provisions collected primarily from Georgia and surrounding southern states.  &lt;br /&gt;The federal government took action by passing a Senate bill on March 8.

The ritual act of lynching was used by white Southerners to literally destroy the humanity of the black victim, but also to symbolically destroy that of every member of the race.  White Southerners terrorized African-Americans into submission by publicly killing a black person who violated some arbitrary behavior.  White Southerners couldn't stand the idea of a black person injuring a white person and getting away with the crime. Whites feared if the crime went unpunished it would encourage blacks to rise up against isolated whites on plantations.  White Southerners used lynchings to compensate for what they perceived as weak governments.  Lynchings occurred at higher rates in counties that had limited law enforcement, limited communication with the outside world, and a transient population.  Since many black people were forced to migrate to where there was work, it created a volatile situation.   &lt;br /&gt;The Chicago Daily Tribune reported there were 95 confirmed lynchings of African-Americans during 1889, of which 92 occurred in the South. According to Tuskegee Institute records from 1882 to 1951, crimes that resulted in lynching were: 41 per cent for felonious assault, 19.2 per cent for rape, 6.1 per cent for attempted rape, 4.9 per cent for robbery and theft, 1.8 per cent for insult to white persons, and 22.7 per cent for miscellaneous offenses or no offense at all.  In the last category various trivial offenses were reported, such as disputing with a white man, attempting to register to vote, unpopularity, self-defense, testifying against a white man, asking a white woman to marry, and peeping in a window."],"display_date":"April 23, 1889","search_date":"1889-04-23","locations":[{"id":14155,"lat":36.8111162856,"lng":-79.3976134371,"zoom":9,"place":"PITTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1278,"title":"Steamboats denied docking privileges for fear of yellow fever or cholera\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-09-29","end_date":"1855-09-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Fear of deadly diseases like yellow fever and cholera brought a panic into towns and had a negative affect on business activity.

This fear was commonly spread by reports in the newspapers about other outbreaks of yellow fever.

By the morning, the Middle Concho was seen to be thirty feet above its level and rapidly rising. They overflowed and destroyed the town, Ben Ficklin, on August 24. As recorded in the article Swept Away by a Flood,' the office register at Fort Concho had measured the rainfall at 5.85 inches, which is one inch more than the average rain fall for an entire year in this region. &lt;br /&gt;This same article illustrated the horror of the event: Human life was swept down by the merciless current with driftwood and dozens of beings clung to the floating timbers or swung to trees and brush until the tops to which they clung were snapped off by the resistless torrent and then went down.' The article states that the saddest story was that of Mrs. M. J. Metcalf and her family. In the morning, thinking that the water had risen to its highest point, Mrs. Metcalf and her daughter did not evacuate. When the water rose even higher, they climbed up to the roof to keep out of reach of the water. Several men came to rescue them, but the boat they were traveling in half full of water, capsized, within ten feet of the house.' Moments later the roof broke in two and the Metcalfs went screaming as they disappeared beneath the drift.'  Only one man, Mr. S.C. Robertson was saved because he was able to grab a hold of a tree and held on through as terrible a day and night as anyone ever endured.' &lt;br /&gt;Only the courthouse, the jail, the schoolhouse, and seventeen houses remained. Sixty-five people drowned. The Washington Post reported that the destroyed property was estimated to be worth around 40,000 to 100,000. Because of the devastation, the county offices and the post office were moved to San Angela. This town became the new county seat in 1883 and renamed San Angelo. Some survivors of the flood moved to find jobs and homes in Sherwood and San Angelo.

In the South homicide among blacks and whites was the highest compared to the rest of the nation and world. Within the turbulent south during the 1880s and early 1890s, politics and economic turmoil' constantly threw both blacks and whites into conflict. Most violence was caused by whites going against the blacks, especially since it was they who believed that it was the blacks who were dangerous and the blacks who bred the violence that hung over the South.' Blacks, however, at times did turn against the whites, and when they did so, they risked serious punishment by the whites. As Ayers explains that because the white men believed a legal execution was too good for such criminals,' these blacks were often dragged from jail to be tortured, hanged, and burned by these mobs of white men. This very situation occurred in Eastman, Georgia on August 6, 1882. &lt;br /&gt;An argument between two black men started a riot when thousands of blacks gathered for a camp meeting. The Montgomery Advertiser simply explained that a white police man attempted to restrain the aggressor, but the aggressor knocked down the policeman. A white deputy marshal shot this aggressor, called a fleeing prisoner,' which infuriated the mob. On August 12, the Atlanta Constitution states that the marshal and deputy marshal of Eastman arrested Jake Johnson on the charge of stealing a watch, and he shot and killed him as he tried to run away.  &lt;br /&gt;As a result, the angry mob murdered Mr. James Q. Harvard whose identity was mistaken for the deputy. The Atlanta Constitution describes that young Harvard was shot through the face and in the arm, and then he was dragged into the street and his head beaten into a pulp with heavy scantlings in the hands of the brutes.'  This article also claimed that the black people called for setting fire to the white houses and killing local whites. Eventually the police was able to subdue and arrest the crowd. At the end of the riot, one white man, Harvard, and four black men were killed. &lt;br /&gt;Further, Ayers also stated that local black leaders, for their own purposes, often joined with the whites in blaming vagrant blacks for any crime in the neighborhood.' &lt;br /&gt;The colored citizens of Eastman held a meeting after the outbreak to adopt resolutions unanimously' as explained in the article The Riot at Eastman.' There were two resolutions. The first stated that they, as Christians and law abiding citizens,' condemned the actions of the mob. The second stated that they were sympathetic to the unfortunate families of the deceased. The article further explained that the Eastman County is overrun by a turbulent negro population' from Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. These people are supposedly brought out to Georgia to work on  the turpentine plantations below Eastman, and these people were the lawless, turbulent, and dangerous' rioters. &lt;br /&gt;The Atlanta Constitution in the Eastman Riot' article claimed that the authorities of Eastman and Doge County were doing all in their power to bring the perpetrators of this foul murder to justice.' A few months later, twenty-five people were convicted in court. The sentence called for six men and one woman to be hanged while the rest received life sentences of imprisoned labor."],"display_date":"August 6, 1882 - August 12, 1882","search_date":"1882-08-09","locations":[{"id":1735,"lat":32.1721870425,"lng":-83.1684277696,"zoom":9,"place":"DODGE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1328,"title":"Charleston Doctor addresses Board of Health on Yellow Fever\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-10-18","end_date":"1839-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In October of 1839, Thomas Y.

This name being from the occurrence approximately three to four days after contracting the fever of vomiting a black substance, usually clotted blood.  Other names he included were jungle fever' and the Bulam Fever.'&lt;br /&gt;He elaborated on several arguments of the day on the cause of the Yellow fever.  Systematically disproving each one, he reached no singe conclusion on the cause of the fever in their city.  He mentioned an argument that it rose from the filth and exhalations near the wharfs, but refuted this saying these existed every year but the fever did not.  He also made note that native children rarely ever died from the fever.  He supposed that this was from the lack of shelter they received from the outside world in comparison to the white children.  &lt;br /&gt;Other observations he noted was that the fever always occurred in high heat and during humid times.  The stagnate water and lack of trees in the city, he said, my indeed lead to the fever.  He ended with a recommendation to clean the city of the filth where such mists, humidity and exhalations arise.&lt;br /&gt;The disease persisted in America throughout the 19th Century.  Not until the early 1900's was the modern scientific method applied to research on Yellow fever and malaria.  The discovery of germs and their affects on humans and disease was a breakthrough.  Stemming for Pasteur's research with canning and preservation, a doctor named Jesse Lazaer working for the army discovered the disease was carried by mosquitoes.

Although he was arrested and sometimes convicted on charges such as drinking and gambling, adultery, and theft, he became a leader of Choctaw County's blacks. He was also a somewhat successful organizer for the local Republicans and he played a key role in bringing the Republicans and the Greenbacks together. Not only were the whites persuaded that black crime was out of control, but as found in the Promise of the New South, whites were terrified of the rumors stating that black criminals were held up as heroes by the black community, championed for their bravery against persistent white.' Turner epitomized this situation, for he himself was a man of political influence, a leader of the black community, and he planed a conspiracy against the whites. &lt;br /&gt;On August 15, some papers were found supposedly revealing Turner as the leader of a widespread black conspiracy to murder all the whites in Choctaw County. The Montgomery Advertiser printed some of the papers that had been revealed. According to  these papers, the plot had been in existence since 1878. In 1882, the number of the conspirators had grown to 400. They had gathered guns and intended to rise up on Sunday night, September 17, when the whites would be attending a meeting unarmed.  &lt;br /&gt;Then on August 16, the citizens of Mount Sterling and Butler decided to arrest the leaders of the conspiracy: Jack Turner, F.D.

Many newspapers were waiting for the results of the examination of his brain wondering if he was indeed mentally insane. At the time of his death, he still believed that he was sent by God to assassin President Garfield. Just before he was hung, he recited a poem he had written that morning. Newspapers published these words for the country to read, such as the Keowee Courier in South Carolina: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to the Lordy, I am so glad,&lt;br /&gt;I am going to the Lordy, I am so glad,&lt;br /&gt;I am going to the Lordy,&lt;br /&gt;Glory hallelujah Glory Hallelujah&lt;br /&gt;(;)&lt;br /&gt;I am with the Lord. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The historian Charles Rosenberg explains that, at least in Washington, there was an extraordinary interest' in this hanging. Even the captain of the guard sold individually guaranteed pieces of lining from the coffin. Newspapers printed extra special editions, and the next day, detailed narratives appeared in newspapers across the nation. Guiteau's body was buried on July 1, 1882. The Washington Post illustrated this situation: Not a word was spoken, not a tear was shed. An outcast from human sympathy when living, Guiteau had found an un-wept sepulture in an un-marked grave.' &lt;br /&gt;Now that Guiteau was dead, the question was then to see if doctors and physicians could determine if he was mentally insane or not by examining his brain. One member stated in the Post that the condition of the membrane might or might not indicated insanity.' This still did not prevent speculation about insanity. On September 7 as mentioned in the Keowee Courier, Dr. Lamb received the results of the investigations of the microscopic experts. Although he did not mention his own opinions, he did say that Dr. Goddin believed that Guiteau was insane, but the medical fraternity must draw their own conclusions.

He had been dying of Epithelioma, a skin cancer, and underwent several operations, and in response to his suffering, the State wrote that he displayed heroic Christian fortitude.' &lt;br /&gt;The State explained the nature of Senator Hill's sickness and gave a reason for the cause of this cancer. Certain journalists speculated that perhaps the cancer had first started on his tongue because he had a peculiar habit of holding a cigar constantly in his mouth and keeping the nicotine-coated end against the left side of his tongue.' Hill had his first surgery on July 22, 1881 in which Dr. Goss removed a section of the left side of the tongue two inches long and a half an inch wide.' The disease, however, continued to spread and he needed to have a second surgery in which a large part of the tongue was removed. For over a year, the Senator was in pain whenever he moved his tongue in articulation, mastication and swallowing.' He received nourishment through a tube which was passed down the esophagus because he could no longer swallow. As mentioned in the Atlanta Constitution, on July 12, 1882, he could no longer speak and used a writing pad and pencil in order to get his message across.  The Montgomery Advertiser further explained that he had been administered three grains of morphine a day to help ease the pain and allow him to sleep. &lt;br /&gt;At the time of his death on August 12, 1882, the cancer had spread to the back of  the throat and had destroyed the tonsil, palate and the soft tissues on the left side.

They called it acute congestion of the stomach and brain.'  In 1887, Anne Sullivan, a teacher and former student of Perkins Institute for the Blind in Massachusetts, traveled to Alabama at the request of Helen's mother Kate Keller.  The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me;It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was seven years old,' Helen recalled.&lt;br /&gt;Anne Sullivan's biggest breakthrough with her new pupil occurred on April 5, 1887 when she taught Helen the meaning of the word water'.

Many accidents occurred, varying from simple unimportant incidents such as a hand crushed, to as serious incidents such as a black man's head cut off when a train ran over him. Often accidents happened on the tracks, and trains collided with other trains and other objects. &lt;br /&gt;At about 11 o'clock on Monday morning, a freight train ran into the back of the material train, which was stationary on the tracks. Because of this collision, six cars of the material train were smashed to pieces' and the freight train's engine forced the material train off the tracks. According to the State, the accident happened at the end of a deep cut which winds through a hill,' and as the train was traveling rapidly, no danger signal was given.  Supposedly the collision could not have been stopped by the men on the freight train to whom no blame can be attached.' &lt;br /&gt;The fireman and the brake man, Lilbern Craig and P.H. early respectively, jumped off the train before the collision and were wounded. The engineer, John Lambeth, however did not jump, but was fortunately knocked off by the broken timbers and he received painful injuries, but not serious ones. The article reported that these were the only three men injured during the collision. A black man who was lying asleep in the caboose car in the material train was thrown twelve or fifteen feet, and was aroused from his slumbers by the noise of crashing timbres. He, however, received no injuries, just a terrible fright.'&lt;br /&gt;The freight train engine was completely destroyed, and the freight train for the most part remained on the track with the exception of the front wheels of the engine.

One of the problems that arose from this situation involved the Platte County, Missouri, which, according to the Times-Picayune, some desired to be annexed to Kansas by pro-slavery factions on the border between Missouri and Kansas.  This heightened tensions between the pro-slavery and free-soil groups near that area.&lt;br /&gt;A land dispute led to the shooting of free-soiler Charles Dow by pro-slavery Franklin N. Coleman.  As the Nashville Union and American quotes from the Courier, this dispute began when three Abolitionists went to the home of Mr. Coleman and ordered him to leave.  He retrieved a weapon, and when one of the Abolitionists shot at Coleman, he shot the man dead.  Coleman gave himself up for trial, but, while he was gone, a mob of abolitionists drove Coleman's wife and children out of their home, setting fire to his property along with the homes of 15 other pro-slavery families in the area. This erupted into a larger conflict when the sheriff of Missouri arrested Lawrence, a friend of Dow's, on the charge of conspiring to retaliate against Coleman, as many of his comrades had already done by burning.  Deputy Marshal Jones arrested Dow, but the free-soilers gathered in a strong force, trying to coerce his release.  The militia had to be ordered by the Governor to ensure order in the area of Lecompton.   The Deputy ended up with a large group of pro-slavery Missourians behind him, with the intent of offering their services to the Governor to aid in maintaining the laws.' &lt;br /&gt;According to the Richmond Dispatch, the forces from Missouri were know as the Platte Riffle Company, and they marched up to meet up in Franklin with pro-slavery factions from Wakarusa and Westport.  It was reported that the Wayandott and the Shawnee Indians were going to side with the Free-Soil forces.  This quarrel highlights the escalation of tensions that resulted in Bleeding Kansas.'"],"display_date":"November 29, 1855","search_date":"1855-11-29","locations":[{"id":7840,"lat":39.3803676231,"lng":-94.773626879,"zoom":9,"place":"PLATTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1399,"title":"Regulator Mob Burns RIchard Coleman\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-10-01","end_date":"1899-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The South was a region characterized by extreme violence following the civil war, much of which resulted from racial tensions.  The flagrant racism found throughout the south explains why the majority of murders were committed by white men against black victims.  However, many killings of blacks remained unreported as they often went unpunished.   All murder cases in which the victim was white were reported and the black murderer was more often than not put to death.  In 1885 a publisher  estimated over two hundred and twenty three murders occurred each year in Kentucky.  Violence towards blacks in the south was commonplace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence continued in Kentucky following the post-war periods.  Formal organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan initiated acts of violence in the years following the Civil War.  However, by 1890 Kentucky had become increasingly lawless and lesser organizations connected to the Ku Klux Klan carried out frequent acts of violence throughout Kentucky.  These groups were known as Regulators'.  They committed lawless acts under the justification that they were in fact doing their part for the preservation of justice in the white south.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, 1899 a civilian mob attacked the jail and demanded prisoner Richard Coleman.   Coleman, a cook for the Lashbrook's, confessed to the murder of Mrs. Lashbrook, whose father in law had represented Mason county in the third Constitutional Convention in 1850.  Her body was found on October 5, 1899 in a cabin on her husband's farm six miles outside of Mayesville.  On October 6, 1899 hundreds of people called for the hanging of Coleman and unsuccessfully attacked the jail at 2:00 a.m.  The following day, Mrs. Lashbrook's funeral was held and Coleman was sent to Covington for safety reasons.  Once the mob seized Richard Coleman, they burned him alive in front of hundreds of onlookers and publicly mutilated his corpse.  The African American Richard Coleman was an accused murderer. No punishment was imposed upon those who partook despite the fact that their identities were known."],"display_date":"October 1, 1899 - October 30, 1899","search_date":"1899-10-15","locations":[{"id":5127,"lat":38.5951990256,"lng":-83.8240569898,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1427,"title":"Lynching of Bob Harper\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-12-14","end_date":"1892-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 14, a black man assaulted Kate Anderson in her home in Park City, Kentucky.

On June 30, 1892, a three-year contract with the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers expired.  The Carnegie Steel Company, managed at this time by Henry Clay Frick, attempted to cut the wages of the skilled steel workers.  When the workers refused the pay cut, the entire work force was locked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frick called in strikebreakers to work and Pinkerton agents to protect them.  On July 6, an army of 300 Pinkertons arrived.  Union and non-union workers joined forces against the Pinkertons.  The ensuing battle lasted thirteen hours, with the Pinkertons surrendering to the workers.  Several strikers and Pinkerton men died in the fight, and many others were wounded.  The state militia was called out to weaken the union forces and restore order.  This initial battle was a victory for the strikers and encouraged other strikers around the nation to take action.  As a result, strikes occurred at Coeur d'Alene in Idaho, at the mines in Tennessee, at New Orleans in Louisiana, and in the city of New York.  These strikes demonstrated the unrest among workers in the age of industrial progress.  Many workers felt that slavery had not ended it had just taken a different form.  Workers toiled for long hours in poor conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 20, the Homestead strike was finally declared over.

It involved nearly ten thousand men at one time.  The loss of wages amounted to approximately 2,000,000, and the loss of the firm was estimated at nearly double that.

The Sheriff gathered a posse of fifty or seventy-five armed men.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The underlying cause of the uprising was the hanging of Charles Hill, a black who assaulted Lydia Starr.

The Baton Rouge Gazette reports on January 30, 1830, that on Saturday night last about 10 o'clock Mr. John Whitten was killed by one of his own slaves, by a discharge from a musket loaded with buckshot.' Events such as this, an actual murder by a slave were extremely rare in the slave South, and when they did occur were a shock to the community and caused a great deal of anxiety and often conspiracy theories about slave uprisings -- such as fear of events like what became known as Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. As to Gazette writes when we see such outrages committed by negroes of the country, what have we not to fear from the strange negroes who are introduced every day into the State of Louisiana?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far more likely than the outright murder of his or her master was that a slave would simply run away, whether it be in an attempt to get to the North or just to a secluded local area. Southern newspapers, then, are littered with advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves as well as notices of captured runaways and where they are being held. The Richmond Enquirer, for example, lists on April 16, 1830, on a single page three different rewards for runaways and three notices of a captured slave being held in the local jail. The Raleigh Regsiter, on March 25, 1830, includes an ad entitled Notice. Twenty Dollar Reward. Ran away from the subscriber on the 10th of February.' Interestingly, here the ad describes the runaway as a white slave,' referring to his skin tone, perhaps meaning he had a white parent or grandparent. All of these ads, however, list a brief description of the runaway as well as the name given by his or her master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, sometimes the unthinkable did occur and a slave struck back. The aftermath, however, is important because it is designed to establish a sense of justice in the eyes of white slave owners, and to reassure them about the continuity of a stable slave society. Zac, for example, the slave convicted of murdering John Whitten, was described as his master's favorite,' and he confessed that he alone was guilty.' Thus, to white society this was a single act by what was likely a deranged individual. After all, why would a slave who was his master's favorite' have any reason to kill that master?"],"display_date":"January 30, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-30","locations":[{"id":5501,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1466,"title":"Lynchings in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-07-05","end_date":"1892-07-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Smith Tooley and John L.

William Henry Hatch of Missouri joined forces with Norman J. Coleman to create legislation that would promote all aspects of agriculture.  The Martinsburg Gazette reported that President Grover Cleveland approved the famous Hatch Act on March, 2 1887,' which created agricultural experiment stations in each state.  At these experiment stations, scientists worked with farmers, ranchers, suppliers, and processors to promote better food production at faster rates.  Also, the bill created an executive department to be known as the Department of Agriculture and Labor.  One of [the amendments] provides for the transfer of the Bureau of Labor to the proposed new department,' stated the Martinsburg Gazette.  After the agriculture department received cabinet status, weekly bulletins were issued to farmers free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;Before the Morrill Act of 1862, little attention had been given to education as a means of developing better agricultural methods,' describes McReynolds about the effects of the Hatch Act, but by 1900, schools began adopting agriculture in their curricula.  This helped spread agricultural knowledge to the younger generations and assisted current farmers with new techniques and machines as the farming industry rapidly grew.  Campbell expresses how the stations stimulated agricultural growth in Texas by saying, The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, established in 1887, researched every aspect of agriculture in [Texas] in an effort to increase production, lower costs, and expand markets.'  As a result of combining and expanding the agriculture industry, many people no longer had to live in poverty or eat meagerly because American agriculture had been revolutionized.

An epidemic of cholera was already raging in Europe in the fall of 1865, and as had occurred in 1832 and 1849, it seemed inevitable that the disease would cross the Atlantic and ravage the United States.  New York saw the arrival of the cholera on April 18th, 1866 on the steamship Virginia,' which carried more than a thousand steerage passengers, all assumed to be carrying the disease.  Cholera would spread south gradually through all of the different transportation routes.  &lt;br /&gt;Throughout the newspapers of 1866, there was a plethora of advertisements for different ways to combat cholera infection. Hall's Journal of Health emphasized the importance of cleanliness and cleansing sooner rather than later, February and March being ideal because the suns of spring and summer sooner warm into life and intensify the viperic and malignant influence, which, in its remorseless tread, wrecks so much of human happiness and desolates so many hearth stones.' Readers were encouraged to try the remedy of Dr. Hamlin of Constantinople, whose simple preparation had saved hundreds of people. To make his concoction you simply needed to mix, one part laudanum, one part camphorated spirit, two parts tincture of ginger and two parts capsicum, and take one teaspoon doses of it at three hour intervals until you felt cured. The most amusing advice seen in the newspapers was probably this from Colman's Rural World, which read, The advice for those in fear of cholera is keep your bowels in good order; keep your spirits up and be careful how you pour your spirits down.'&lt;br /&gt; This quest to find a cure for cholera seems a bit ridiculous.  But for the people of the nineteenth century there was no known remedy for the disease and many could not depend on the aid of a doctor. As a result, people turned to the many concoctions they saw advertised in magazines and newspapers to gain some semblance of protection from the epidemic.  After a tremendous cholera outbreak struck both Paris and the United States in 1832, the threat of another epidemic always loomed. Every day on the front page of The Montgomery Advertiser, there was a count of how many had died of the disease in New York City and with the spread of cholera to Richmond in 1866, the threat of disease threatened even more acutely. Although the threat of a cholera epidemic does not truly qualify as one specific event, it was a haunting element of the daily lives of all Southerners in 1866, no matter their race or economic background."],"display_date":"January 1, 1866 - June 30, 1866","search_date":"1866-04-01","locations":[{"id":5932,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1603,"title":"Indictment of Jefferson Davis on Treason Charges\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-06-13","end_date":"1866-06-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Losing the Civil War crushed the South, both physically and psychologically, but the worst blow was yet to come. On June 13, 1866 in Norfolk, Virginia, Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederate States of America was indicted for treason. The physician who attended the imprisoned Jefferson Davis, Dr. John J. Craven, told of Davis' time in Fortress Monroe in his book, The Prison Life of Jefferson Davis.  He described the procession of Jefferson Davis into the fort with his wife and children and the condition of his life there: His sole reading-matter a Bible and prayer book, his only companions those two silent guards, and his only food the ordinary rations of bread and beef served out to soldiers of the garrison.'  The Daily Richmond Examiner described Davis' desperate conditions in jail, detailing, he, is languishing in a long and unjust confinement that arouses the keenest emotions of the southern heart.'  After being convicted of treason, Mr. Davis remained imprisoned for two years and then returned to Richmond.  He accepted that secession was not a viable option for the south at that time, but remained a staunch opponent of strong central government.  Although Jefferson Davis was resented by some and his leadership during the war was often questioned, his trial and subsequent indictment served as a rallying point for the South.  When he was on his death bed in December 1889 people constantly stopped by his residence to see if his condition had improved.  Jefferson Davis died on December 6, 1889.  The funeral on December 11, was one of the largest in southern history, attracting by some estimations upwards of two hundred thousand people.

Permission was granted for the settlement of 300 U.S. families; however, after gaining preliminary permission for the establishment of a frontier settlement, Moses contracted pneumonia from four weeks of wet and cold weather on his return trip from Texas to Missouri.

The Union's control meant the freeing of slaves.  This led to a shortage of agricultural labor and a scarcity of resources. This situation was further heightened by slaves who fled from nearby areas to the sanctity of Union borders. &lt;br /&gt;New Orleans was a particular example of this problem, as the black population there increased significantly from 1862-1880.  The overflow of population not only led to a shortage of food but also of jobs.  Thousands of hungry, tattered, unemployed blacks and whites roamed the streets.

They have literally come down to starvation,' (Vincent, 121).

Others held the view that sex after marriage had procreative purpose only. However, many so-called free thinkers such as Charles Knowlton, Abner Kneeland, and Samuel Thompson recognized that Victorian ideals clashed with the reality of everyday life. Many unmarried women who found themselves pregnant used abortion as commonplace birth control practice. ","Abortion practices were not always safe. Local doctors replaced local midwives who had previously performed abortion procedures. However, little actual gynecological medical training or practice complicated the procedure. Many in new medical professional groups pushed for greater autonomy and influence of highly trained medical practitioners to replace the backward practices of quacks who advocated abortion. In Missouri and throughout the South, this growing influence created a greater movement towards white professional doctors. The effect led to the passage of the 1835 St. Louis, Missouri abortion statute, a full twenty years before many states passed similar laws. However, this law hardly stopped sex among unmarried couples or hindered adulterous relationships. Women and men circumvented the law by turning to the work of the free-thinkers, who published and distributed pamphlets on sexual and reproductive health and contraceptive methods. In the South alone, liberal literature included topics about contraceptive methods and sexual advice. This literature circulated to more than 200 agents by 1836, many of whom operated near St. Louis and along the Mississippi river. One popular example included Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy, which made it to third edition within three years of its original publication in 1830. Popular mail-order items in Missouri-among other states nationwide-included condoms, feminine cleansing products, and abortifacients. Though free-thought groups flourished nationwide, they often kept semi-private for fear of being thought liberal and infidel in their causes. More readily available and cheaper contraceptive devices for men-a dozen condoms sold for three dollars in 1850-allowed couples to engage in sexual relationships, although secret, with fewer consequences.","Many kept their sexual freedoms covert in Missouri and the South not only because of the abortion law, but also because of the issue of interracial sexual relationships. As Nathan Stormer notes, reproductive control for early opponents represented a cacophonous...threatening assault on the status quo of gender, family and class relations. Many feared that if fear of pregnancy were removed from sexual intercourse, wives' sexual faithfulness could not be assured, legitimate children might not so easily be distinguished from illegitimate children, and bloodlines and inheritance might, in consequence, be jeopardized. Because inheritance often dictated property rights in the South, the case of illegitimate-and perhaps mulatto-children produced from an adulterous relationship made easier with birth control brought this issue to the regional and national forefront."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1955,"title":"The Call for Prohibition by Missouri Temperance Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-21","end_date":"1836-01-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though a large religious presence existed in Missouri, its inhabitants succumbed to a great number of vices, including alcohol abuse amongst men. The widespread alcohol abuse in St. Louis, the gateway to the West, caused many that passed through the city to comment on the wicked city containing an excessive number of deists and infidels. Some cited alcohol abuse as a result of the growing population that moved away from the church because of their involvement in more secular affairs, including journeying west. Ministers tried to resolve this problem quickly, especially when they viewed alcohol responsible for all of the ills of society: drunkenness, gambling, fighting, general disorder, Sabbath-breaking, and upper-class freethinking. "," By the 1830s, temperance societies sprung up in Missouri and throughout the South to combat alcoholism and end the noted loss of spirituality amongst those who were being swept up by alcohol's burning tide...to the gulf of eternal ruin. In early 1836, the Temperance Society of St. Louis called for a day of simultaneous meetings in which to rekindle the push for Prohibition, or at least temperance within the state of Missouri. The society noted that intemperance was never more rife, more open or more destructive to society and members wished to end the ravages...far more horrible than those of any plague or pestilence that ever swept through our borders. "," Within the religious South, the source of temperance societies and the influence of modern morality came from those who became largely involved in church life. The Missouri Temperance Society created an awareness of both social and physical abuse in the state when it called for a day of simultaneous meetings to help stop intemperance. Temperance societies tried to reduce the number of crimes and accidents that resulted from the use of alcohol. Included in the reported effects of alcoholism was abuse towards women, children, and slaves, especially in the South where moonshine, whiskey, and other drinks flowed freely. The widespread diffusion of temperance societies that occurred between 1830 and 1850 shifted the direction of the movement from one of alcohol in moderation to abstinence. In addition, the southern temperance movement that involved thousands spread to millions throughout the nation. Societies even invited women to take an increasingly important part in temperance work; the Women's Christian Temperance Union was established nationwide by the mid-1870s and remained influential through the 1920s."],"display_date":"January 21, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-21","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1969,"title":"Medicine Chests and Self-Sufficiency in Medical Care\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-06-27","end_date":"1817-06-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" R. Jeffery and A. Alt advertised the sale of aromatic snuff in the <em>American Beacon and Commercial Daily</em> on June, 27 1817 in Norfolk, Virginia. Jonathon P. Whitwell prepared and bottled the aromatic snuff in Boston. Whitwell shipped the snuff to Norfolk and various other locations across the East coast. Jeffery and Alt sold the aromatic snuff to Virginians who desired to fill their medicine chests in order to gain self-sufficiency in medical care. "," According to Catharine C. Hopely, a tutor at Forest Hill near Tappahannock County in 1815, a capacious medicine chest is an inseparable part of a Southern establishment; and I have seen medicines enough dispensed to furnish good occupation for an assistant when colds or epidemics have prevailed. Virginians frequently resorted to home-remedies due to the inaccessibility of many farms to main highways, good roads and means to speedy transportation that prevented them from reaching physicians. Thus, Virginians on plantations, farms, and even urban households desired self-sufficiency in medical care. The desire for self-sufficiency stemmed from the economics of slave holding that instructed masters to do everything possible to keep their slave force healthy."," When caring for slaves, if a combination of drugs or particular medication arrested symptoms, slave owners used that treatment until a better one came along. According to historian Todd L. Savitt, plantation overseers and owners recorded useful medical recipes and clipped suggestion from newspapers into their journals. Most homes possessed a medical digest in addition to a well stocked medicine chest. Many Virginians owned <em>Simon's Planters Guideand Family book of Medicine </em> or <em>Ewell's Medical Companion</em>. Digests presented specific instructions on the treatment of many disease, the proper dosages of drugs for each age group, and the best uses for most medicine."," Historian Stephanie P. Browner claims that slaves frequently treated their diseases or illnesses themselves without their master's knowledge. Slaves did this for several reasons; to offset the failures and harshness of white remedies or the negligence of masters, and most often to exert some control over their own lives. Black home remedies secretly circulated throughout slave quarters, and elders passed them down to younger generations. According to Browner, some medicines contained ingredients that had purely superstitious values, but slaves mainly obtained cures from local plants. Occasionally, whites learned of an effective treatment that slaves used, and adopted it for themselves. However, this did not affect the business of Jeffery and Alt who traveled around Virginia and sold medicine to Virginians who desired to fill their medicine chests with a large assortment of remedies."," Slaves represented a financial investment that required protection, and it made enormous sense for masters to maintain the health of their slaves. Awareness that certain illnesses could easily spread to a master's own families if not properly treated became a strong incentive for masters to keep their slaves healthy.

Winston declared their services available to the people of Nashville on March 13, 1852. The two doctors provided both the practice of general medicine and surgery. The advertisement gave the locations of their offices, the first on Cherry Street and the second out of Doctor J.D. Winston's home on Vine Street. Doctor C.K. Winston gained significant praise in the medical community when the new medical school in Nashville opened up. The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal announced it would not be surprising were Nashville to become a great medical center. The same publication named eight distinguished faculty members who they believed would contribute the most to the strength of the new school. Among these eight faculty names was Doctor C.K. Winston. The curriculum at the University of Nashville medical school was rigorous. Historian F. Garvin Davenport writes that, In order to graduate with the degree of M.D., the student was required to spend three years in the office of a regular physician, attend two full courses of lectures at the medical school, write an acceptable thesis on some medical topic, and pass a satisfactory examination."," During the 1850s the chief concern of administration at the University of Nashville became the practice of good sanitary and hygiene practices in order to ward of diseases. According to Davenport, the medical school faculty recommended the regularity of eating and exercises in addition to good hygiene, such as bathing on daily basis. In addition to hygiene, professionals at the time regarded the presumed inferiority of African Americans as a medical debate. Two students at the University of Nashville even presented dissertations attempting to prove the theory believed by many that the Negro belonged to a distinct and inferior race. Davenport described the experiments they used to examine the differences in facial angles between the two races. They spoke of the differences between certain nose structures of the white and black man. They looked under a microscope at a white man's piece of a hair and a black man's piece of hair, concluding that the black man's hair was decisively coarser and frizzier than the white man's. Dissertations such as these given at a well respected institution like the University of Nashville further asserted feelings of superiority by southerners over their black counterparts. "," Research projects such as these made the University of Nashville visible and recognizable as an important medical institution. The <em>Boston Medical and Surgical Journal</em> placed a southern institution in the company of several older, more established northern medical institutions.

Palmore, an attorney in Fayette County, Tennessee, wrote a letter to one of his colleagues. Attorney Edward Brown received the letter from Palmore in Ballsville, Virginia. Palmore boasted the supremacy of the state of Tennessee to the state of Virginia. I will say nothing about the fertility of our soil and other advantages afforded here to the young and enterprising, Palmore declared. He quickly transitioned into the matter he wished to discuss: the issue of the settlement of John Robinson's estate."," C.S. Palmore acted as the administrator of Robinson's estate. He discussed primarily the placement of John Robinson's negroes. Initially Palmore left them with a woman by the name of Miss Frances. Yet as Palmore specified, Robinson did not name Miss Frances as the legatee of the estate. By legatee Palmore meant beneficiary, or the person named in a will to receive part or all of the state. In fact, in his letter to attorney Edward Brown, Palmore acted concerned only with the need for the legatees to pay Miss Frances for her trouble and expense as caretaker of Robinson's slaves. He hoped that Brown could help him find the legatees, a family he finally referred to as the Merymans. Palmore proposed that Brown act as (his) agent in the matter and if the legatees apply for their negroes if they will pay all charges and will release me in your better judgment you may let them have them or if they will sell them to you it will meet my full and harty approbation."," John Robinson?s written will provided instructions for the delegation of all his estate. C.S. Palmore struggled and sought help on only the matter of the future of Robinson?s slaves. Although the woman he referred to in his writing seemed to willingly look after Robinson?s slaves, Palmore pointed out the imposition of this to Edward Brown. Miss Frances benefited only marginally if at all from keeping Robinson's slaves. He seemed to insinuate that the cost was more than she can afford. Palmore declared to Brown that Miss Frances' account for raising George (one of Robinson's slaves) up to the first of February 1845 was 66.73 dollars. "," Slaves like George could either be an asset or a liability in the South. Robinson?s slaves became a liability to Miss Frances and she could only profit from their sale. Bobby Lovett's <em>The African-American History of Nashville, Tennessee</em>, describes a similar exchange that was had with a slave named Frank. When Frank's owner died he was left to his heirs who promptly made plans to convert this asset into cash. Whether in Tennessee, Virginia, or elsewhere in the South, inherited slaves posed a problem to both executors and beneficiaries of estates. Slaves required housing, food, and clothing. Slaves possessed too great a value to just give up, but created a cost that some inheritors could not afford to bear."],"display_date":"March 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-03-01","locations":[{"id":11986,"lat":35.1984324227,"lng":-89.4156896322,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2024,"title":"Girl Chooses Death Over Shame\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The majority of farms in Brunswick, Missouri used slave labor up through the Civil War. H.C. Bruce was a slave on one of these farms. Many years after the Civil War, Bruce reflected on his experiences as a slave and recorded them in a book. According to Bruce, slave owners in Brunswick believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life. About nine miles from his farm lived a slaveholder named V. Harper. Harper owned quite a number of slaves, including one particular family that was respected by whites and blacks alike for their moral worth and character. In 1858, one of the daughters in this family, who Bruce described as having clean character, discovered that she would soon become a mother. This girl had not yet married nor was she engaged to a man at that time. Rather than dishonor herself and her family by bearing a child without a husband, she walked two miles to reach the Missouri River, plunged herself into it and was drowned."," During his account of the girl, Bruce acknowledged that it [was] not known who led her from the paths of rectitude. He also admitted however, that there would occasionally be a black mother with a very light-colored child. Bruce's diction suggests the slave was impregnated by her master. At that time, slaves were not considered as people, but rather as property. As property, slave owners often treated their slaves as they wished. Historian Joshua Rothman suggests, sexual contact between masters and slaves specifically and whites and blacks generally was commonplace in Virginia and in all slaveholding states. Because relationships between masters and their slaves were common in the antebellum South, it was reasonable that Bruce suggested such a relationship between the girl and her master. "," There are a few reasons why the girl in Bruce's account would have had sexual relations with her master. It was not uncommon in the antebellum South for a master to rape a female slave. As Rothman argues, a black woman's body was her greatest vulnerability. Rape was an effective weapon that slaveholders used to physically and mentally degrade their slaves. It was also a means to assert a racial hierarchy. Second, there were some instances where a slave woman would exchange sexual relations for preferential treatment on the plantation. However, the fact that the nineteen-year old girl drowned herself suggests that she probably did not engage in a sexual relationship to obtain preferential treatment on the farm. "," Though rape was not uncommon between master and slave, Bruce made it clear that slaves considered the action an attack on their honor and morality. Bruce stated that the girl decided that death was preferable in her case to disgrace. Rothman argues that in the antebellum South, a woman's honor resided in her sexual purity. The girl in Bruce's account realized that her pregnancy would bring shame to herself and her family. Instead of giving birth to her master's child, the girl decided to kill herself. With this action, she attempted to salvage as much of her honor and morality as she could."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":7480,"lat":39.5145426187,"lng":-92.9626052094,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARITON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2029,"title":"The Western Sanitary Commission Requests Approval to Support Freed Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-06","end_date":"1863-11-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Since the beginning of the Civil War, the Western Sanitary Commission served armies west of the Mississippi by providing service and supplies to wounded soldiers. On November 6, 1863, the commission looked to broaden its mission. Five representatives from the organization wrote to President Lincoln expressing concern that the state of freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley was daily becoming worse. Under the conditions that these blacks lived, sickness and death [prevailed] to a fearful extent. The members of the Western Sanitary Commission, pointing to their contributions to the sick and wounded soldiers, asked for permission and authority to extend [their] labors to the freed slaves. With the President's endorsement, they believed they could raise large sums of money and accomplish great good. They further argued that by lessening the difficulties of emancipation, material aid would help crush the rebellion."," In its letter to President Lincoln, the Western Sanitary Commission argued that the living condition of the freed slaves was so bad that hundreds of the blacks would gladly return to slavery, to avoid the hardships of freedom. The brush tent shelter of the freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley only provided protection from night dews. The government supplied freed slaves with rations, but distribution was often delayed. Furthermore, freed slaves had no facilities of cooking, and [were] almost ignorant of the use of wheat flour. The Western Sanitary Commission included these details in their letter to President Lincoln to illustrate the great difficulty former slaves experienced while adjusting to life outside of slavery. Historian Eric Foner claims that by 1860, most freed slaves worked as poor urban or rural laborers and enjoyed few rights other than not being considered a form of property. Oftentimes in Missouri, as well as elsewhere in the South, freed slaves worked for wages well below the average wage of a field hand. This forced freed slaves to live under the lowest of living conditions."," The authors of the letter to Lincoln suggested that providing aid to the freed slaves would [lessen] the difficulties of emancipation and thus help crush the Confederate rebellion. By providing aid for former slaves, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to improve the living conditions of freed slaves. The organization argued it would not only be a work of philanthropy, but equally of patriotism, for it would remove an increasing reproach against the Union cause. Although historians Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen claim there was a heavy influence of northern abolitionists in Missouri, abolitionism was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. By giving aid to freed slaves to begin life outside of slavery however, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to prove to the Union that emancipation was both possible and the right thing to do."],"display_date":"November 6, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-06","locations":[{"id":7918,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2035,"title":"Thieving Soldiers Lead to Gunbattle\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-09","end_date":"1865-07-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a Georgia night in June of 1865, three federal soldiers sought out treasure and ended up wounded or dead. The soldiers had heard rumors of the great wealth of Georgia cotton planters. Now, with a freedman guide leading them to the house of Robert Paul where the ex-slave insisted they would find 15,000 in gold and silver, the soldiers hoped to seize a piece of that fortune for themselves.","The plan quickly fell apart. Arriving at the house, the soldiers took Mr. Paul captive and searched the place, discovering only their guide's disappearance into the night. Upset, the soldiers took what animals and possessions they could and set off down the road. Mr. Paul called on this neighbors and community. Soon, people gathered to the number of twelve or fourteen...among them many of the most respectable citizens of the county. This posse set off after the thieves, and while the soldiers had a considerable lead, they had no knowledge of the terrain. When the townsfolk caught up to the criminals, the soldiers opened fire, receiving a volley in kind from the assembled citizens. The soldiers ran, but did not make it far. One fell dead from his horse. The others, wounded and staggering, abandoned their horses and escaped into the nearby marshes. Paul recovered his property, excepting one bullet-ridden mare. The townsfolk reported the matter to the military government the next morning, who passed the investigation down the chain of command and eventually simply accepted the townsfolks' version of the events. The lieutenant in charge issued orders to commands around the city to arrest the escaped soldiers and to send someone from each command to identify the dead man.","     The military government's leniency in the matter differs greatly from the harsh, authoritarian rule of occupation armies in other parts of the South. Perhaps the military presence in and around Macon was too small to enforce order and welcomed the aid of civilians. Regardless, in the unrest and turbulence that followed immediately after the war, the occupation government in Twiggs County seems to have been remarkably willing to work with the local community, even to the extent of accepting dead soldiers. ","     In the immediate wake of being robbed, Mr. Paul did not seek the military government's aid in arresting its wayward soldiers. Rather, he resorted to a very common solution to crime and unrest in the 19th-century South - collective, vigilante justice. Despite the criminals' head start, the citizens of Twiggs County were able to spread the word, arm, organize, and catch up in only a few hours' time. This sort of call-to-arms, then, must not have been terribly rare. Indeed, even the most respected citizens of the county took part in the excursion - it seems that joining such a group was an honorable decision. Vigilantism, arguably native to America, was certainly engrained into this quiet Southern county. Long before lynching was synonymous with racial violence, communities in the Reconstruction South used collective violence to battle disturbances to the peace."],"display_date":"July 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-09","locations":[{"id":2289,"lat":32.670645545,"lng":-83.4297608837,"zoom":9,"place":"TWIGGS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2041,"title":"Yankees Rampage through Barnwell\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-01","end_date":"1865-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the winter and spring of 1865, Union forces smashed through South Carolina. The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer. After burning much of the town to the ground, General Kilpatrick arrived and put a stop to the attack, though the Recorder's letter insists that he gave secret orders to burn the town after dark.","Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas focused on destroying infrastructure and demoralizing Confederate troops. With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2042,"title":"Feeding Prisoners on a Pittance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-20","end_date":"1861-11-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When S. N. Stallings signed up for service in the army of the Confederate States of America, he sought glory and excitement in the defense of his home and values. By 1861, Stallings' dreams had faded. Rather than fighting against invading hordes of Yankees, he was guarding prisoners of war at the courthouse in Barnwell County, South Carolina. ","Worse, the Confederate government had little interest in protecting the health of Stallings' wards. Writing to his friend, General J. N. Hammond of Barnwell, Stallings complains, I have eight thousand prisoners in jail and only receive thirty cents per day for food. With duty and humanity driving him to care for the men as best he could, Stallings wrote to friends such as Hammond to ask for whatever they could spare. Stallings joined the Confederate army hoping for glory, fortune, and advancement. Instead, he received a daily expence - both financially and emotionally. ","     The conditions of the camp drained Stallings' enthusiasm for army life. Each day, the prisoners under his case made reasonable demands: bread, butter, better housing. Each day he had to reject these requests. Soon he began to doubt the judgment of those who let such a state of affairs come to pass. Begging Hammond's opinion on the issue, Stallings offers his own bleak appraisal: I fear that we have weak and incompetent men at the head of affairs.","     Around 60 miles from Stallings' camp lay Andersonville, Georgia, the future home of the notorious prisoner-of-war camp. Like Barnwell (though on a larger scale), Andersonville suffered from overcrowding, food and material shortages, and the resulting deaths of a great many prisoners. The Northern press used Andersonville and Confederate prisons in general as a symbol of barbarity and dishonorable conduct on the part of the South; after the war ended, Henry Wirz, the commander in charge of Andersonville, was the only man executed for war crimes. Historians have debated the justice of this verdict for decades, some pointing out his constant but ineffective attempts to improve conditions. If Stallings' experience is any indication of the circumstances faced by the commander of such a camp, Wirz faced a truly impossible task.","     Prisoners-of-war in both North and South suffered keenly during their captivity. The best figures, while imprecise, estimate that 15.5 percent of the 194,000 Union prisoners died in captivity, a rate 28 percent higher than that for Confederate prisoners.

He complained of pain in his head and extremities and writhed on the bed as his pulse and breath quickened. The disease came to him in the night on a vessel in the Key West Harbor. Dr. C.C. Dupre had no doubt it was the vomito prieto, the yellow fever of Cuba, and it was rapidly progressing to its fatal termination. Yellow fever had struck here before, decimating the forces of Commander Porter in 1823 and compelling his removal, and again in 1829. Since that time, however, outbreaks of the disease were episodic and affected only the younger, transient population, like this young sailor. The older residents had warned the doctor that this season had been forebodingly hot and dead flies lay on the shores in great numbers.","Dupre moved fast. He bled the patient and gave him thirty ounces of olive oil in three doses. He also let him drink freely of the anti-febrile pineapple water. Other remedies he considered were almond oil, lime juice, and calomel in doses from 20 to 30 grams. Over the next two days, the sailor improved greatly, his skin cooler to the touch and the yellowness of his eyes dissipating. In his journal, Dupre recounted that encounter with the deadly disease and others over the course of his summer in Key West; the greatest number of cases occurred during a ten day period in mid-July.","Of greater importance to physicians all over the South were the origin and vector of the disease. Dupre put forth his hypothesis that the elevation of the site, the humidity of the soil, and the presence of marsh miasmata were only secondary influences in its genesis. Yellow fever would remain a mystery for much of the century, drastically altering the development of southern cities.","Almost fifty years later, Dr. J.C. LeHardy read a report in front of the Medical Association of Georgia that echoed Dupre's journal. Elevation was clearly a factor, as epidemics in St. Augustine originated in the low, rain-washed suburbs around the city. The moisture in the soil and the tropical sun that bathed the South were also primary factors in the breeding of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the vector of the disease. LeHardy asked the Medical Association how the South, a region that clothed the world and fed the hemisphere with her long growing seasons and immense forests, could have no large cities. He answered the question himself; the lakes, lagoons, and swamps across the region created an atmosphere for a horrific contagion that only drainage of the soil through canals and cleanliness could remedy. ","Dupre and LeHardy were not alone in their frustration. Yellow fever disrupted the entire fabric of life in the South. Many lost faith in the medical profession as they struggled to find answers, and outbreaks brought commerce to a complete halt. An epidemic in Pensacola in 1822 caused so many residents to flee inland that the Floridian, a prominent newspaper, shut down for lack of revenue. Outside investment capital saw the South as a risk. A later Florida epidemic in 1841 decimated such a large part of the population that it almost delayed Florida's admission to the Union. Florida, in close trading proximity to Havana, Cuba, was especially prone to importation of the disease. ","Despite all yellow fever's devastating effects, it fueled the growth of public health in the South. State legislatures created Boards of Health to prevent and isolate outbreaks, and the United States Public Health Service acquired funding, staffing, and authority to combat yellow fever. Throughout the nineteenth century, citizens demanded greater government involvement in disease control and better institutions to meet their needs."],"display_date":"June 8, 1841","search_date":"1841-06-08","locations":[{"id":1426,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2058,"title":"Hitting Shore With a Vengeance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Haynie Bradshaw thanked God every time he arrived back on shore. Oystermen were reputed to be daring and unscrupulous men, who regard[ed] neither the laws of God nor the laws of man, but Bradshaw was a devout Methodist who sometimes led services on Sunday. As an oysterman, Bradshaw dredged the Chesapeake Bay aboard one of the infamous bugeye boats. It was a terrible living. Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery. All the buildings had holes in the floors to toss away emptied shells. The entire town smelled of dead oysters. Girls on the street corner outside Blizzard's were hardly discreet about their employment. The town's residents used guns to disperse the rowdy drunks prowling the streets after dark. While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other. The saloon in Crisfield was a far cry from his Methodist Church back home.","While the slavery system ended years earlier, the free labor system for both blacks and whites could be awful as well. In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry. Both blacks and whites were often exploited by the system of sharecropping, where a farmer worked another man's land in return for a small portion of the crops. Life could be difficult for a working man in the South, even if he was free."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":6062,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2067,"title":"Clay&#39;s Grief\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-12-25","end_date":"1835-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Christmas day, 1835, was a most miserable day for Henry Clay. One moment he was laughing and joking with friends; then his life changed drastically. He received a letter from home. Upon opening it, he fell directly to the ground, as if he had been shot. The first words he managed to utter, Every tie to life is broken He had received new of his daughter's death. Although he became more composed as the day progressed, he was heartbroken. Ann was his pride and joy, and of all his children she was his greatest comfort. She was frank, gay, and warm hearted. Ann married a very rich man and lived on a plantation adjourning Clay's. They interacted daily. Of five daughters, Ann was the last. Mrs. Clay also suffered at the thought of life without the joy of her daughters. Mr. Clay responded to a sympathy letter on December 31, 1835. In this he thanked a friend for her kind words but explained, All the efforts of friendship or of my own mind have but little effect on a heart as wounded as mine is. His dear Ann had tastes, sympathies, and amusements identical to his own. She was interwoven into every plan he held for his future. The loss of Ann was one that could never be repaired, there is nothing before me in the world but duties. ","Henry Clay was one of the top political players during this time in United States history. This letter, describing his deep loss and the pain Ann's death brought him, provides a very personal glance into his life. Clay served in both the House and the Senate and, despite his multiple failed attempts at the Presidency, he still managed to leave his mark on history. He was the founder of the Whig Party, in opposition of Andrew Jackson. Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra describe Clay in their book, New Histories of the Old Dominion, Virginia Reconsidered, as a man who brought to the political stage the very qualities women did on the domestic one- moral virtue, love of harmony, and the willingness to compromise. They go on to say that women were endeared to him. Perhaps this affection, passion, and love of harmony are in part a reaction the great loss of his dear Ann. Clay's favorite word was harmony and he has gone down in history as a peacemaker and the Great Pacificator. On Christmas day, 1835, Clay suffered a loss that would forever change him.

Two African American brothers, James Grubb and Bud Grubb were making preparations for the holidays in Wytheville, Virginia. The two brothers had been heavily drinking while they were in town. Bud was described as being full up when they eventually returned home. Upon their arrival to their home, Bud began physically abusing his sister at which point James tried to intervene. Bud then attacked James with a razor, James then reacted by shooting his brother in the chest, delivering a fatal wound. James then fled the scene and managed to evade police apprehension. Almost a year and a half later, James Grubb surrendered himself to police for the murder of his brother, Bud Grubb. His bail was set at 500 dollars. His trial was set for later that month, but the outcome was unknown. ","A year prior to the conclusion of this criminal case, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, which enacted the separate but equal rule for the civil rights of African Americans. In response to this doctrine, the court system attempted to prevent Southern state courts from obstructing justice against African Americans by giving federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases. The purpose of this legislation was to establish a sense of equality among blacks and whites. Potential inequality could arise in the southern states where slavery and the oppression of African Americans had been legally allowable. However, it was also during this period Jim Crow laws, both formal and informal, were enacted in the region. Contrary to previous legislation to give federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases, the federal courts from Reconstruction onward consistently and frequently decreed Jim Crow segregation to be constitutional and consistent with the law of the lands. Not only did the Jim Crow laws affect African American standing both socially and economically, but also with respect to protection from the law. African Americans were subject to greater rates of incarceration and harsher sentences compared to whites who committed the same crime."," Also during this time, community-sanctioned lynching occurred, where mobs would take an alleged criminal (usually African American), torture, mutilate and kill them. The Grubb family murder would be less likely to result in a lynching because it occurred within the family and it occurred between two African Americans. Although the outcome of the trial was not reported, as a result of the Jim Crow laws and the atmosphere of unequal distribution of justice, the Grubb brother would most likely receive a harsher penalty then a member of the white community.

He saw little or no action in the war for his first eighteen months of service, but he heard reports from members of his regiment who scouted the movement of the Confederate army. He was taken aback when he heard that Confederates had adopted the practice of hanging black men to discourage them and others from joining the Union army. Southerners were determined to punish any black man caught fighting against the South. In a letter to his wife and family in New Hampshire, Shedd proclaimed, Alas For the poor slave It is great wonder to me that they do not rebel; they would if they were not the most quiet, inoffensive race on earth. Besides expressing sympathy for blacks in this letter, he also claimed that slaves in Florida appeared to be more intelligent, to speak better English, and to be better looking than those he saw in South Carolina. To his disappointment, however, there were still no public schools in Florida where people of all races and classes could learn that all men are created equal in the sight of God.","Although many Union soldiers, perhaps even Shedd himself, were still racist during the Civil War, Shedd and other Northerners did see the many benefits of enlisting black soldiers as early as 1862. For many Union soldiers, the violent acts of southerners towards blacks were shocking and repulsive. The large free black population, their perceived prosperity and employment opportunities, and the extensive presence of Union garrisons in Key West all combined to positively influence perception of black Floridians. For Shedd, his intense patriotism, longing for his family, and strong sense of morality is what led him to denounce the maltreatment of blacks. ","Despite Shedd's belief that brave black volunteers did not deserve to be lynched for fighting alongside white Northerners, the lynching of blacks by Southerners, about which Shedd heard reports, did not end with the war, but instead, only gained momentum. In fact, people frequently extolled the lynching of black men as a way to enforce segregation in antebellum Florida. Reconstruction-era violence and lynching was rooted in the determination of white Floridians to keep blacks close to the brutal system of slavery which existed in Calvin Shedd's time.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves.

He claimed that selling the slaves could not be done without upsetting Amanda's children. Willis added, the slaves are all of one family, and [they are] mostly children which are constantly increasing in value. He did not think it was right to separate families of slaves when it could be avoided. He realized that for slaves, the slave trade was more than just a financial exchange. A one-time miscalculation on the part of an owner might lead to a life-changing sale for the slave, and Jesse Willis did not want this to happen to his family's slaves. Instead, he insisted on avoiding the separation of slave families.","There have been several court documents that reveal that there were other masters who looked out for the welfare of the slave family. Other owners, like the Sanderson's in Duval County and the Hanson's in St. Johns County, would almost never sell a slave and refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. In addition to court proceedings, slave and master accounts also provide information about master-slave relations and the preservation of the slave family. One slave remembers that he never had to do any strenuous work as long as he won in marbles when he played against slaves of other masters. His master's goal was to excite the ambition of his slaves and promote loyalty through kindness, not to depress their spirits by fear and punishment.","Despite the handful of other cases of kind masters who cared for their slaves, Jesse Willis' demand in the Marion County court was not typical of Southern slave owners. The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved.

Mr. Evans, purveyor of prosthetics, provides the Rev. C.K. Marshall of Vicksburg, Mississippi, as a reference to the suitability of his product for the citizens of the Vicksburg community. "," At the time the ad was placed in the Jackson Weekly Clarion on February 16, 1879, there would have been a high demand for prosthetic limbs among those soldiers who were fortunate enough to return from the Civil War alive. Scores of the roughly eighty thousand Mississippi whites who fought for the Confederate Army were killed, and many more of those who did come home did so missing arms, legs, or sustaining other injuries. Civil War military historians Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson suggest that the military strategy of the Confederate army was particularly responsible for this state of affairs, asserting that casualty lists reveal that the Confederates destroyed themselves by making bold and repeated attacks... these bloody Confederate offensives took the lives of the bravest Southern officers and men. Relatively few combat officers went through the conflict without a single wound, and most of those who did could claim, as did General Reuben L. Walker, who participated in no less than sixty-three battles, that it was not my fault. "," The unpreparedness of Confederate generals for a new sort of warfare fought with rifles, coupled with a tactical aggression that led them to strike offensively even in the face of massive casualties, meant that an entire generation of young men in Mississippi and throughout the South were either lost on the battlefields or came home dramatically wounded. "," Those who survived the bullet blasts often faced even worse in Confederate hospitals. Medical historian George Worthington Adams paints a grim picture of the sort of medical services provided in wartime: The surgeons of the day thought a bare finger was the best probe; they operated in dirty uniforms; they used the same marine sponge to swab out the wounds of countless men; they reused linen dressings; they meddled with wounds and thus made bad matters worse... far from being surprised at the large number of mortalities, we should marvel that a majority of their operations recovered. Such was the state of affairs for soldiers undergoing surgery, to say nothing of those suffering from the many diseases that ravished the Confederate army. "," The appearance of the Charles M. Evan's ad nearly a decade and a half after the war's conclusion demonstrates how far the consequences of the war's characteristics- from poor military strategy to dangerous operating procedures- would last into the era of rebuilding in the South. For the young veterans who would become clients of Evans' artificial limbs business, the destruction brought about by the Civil War was not limited to their land, their communities, or their former homes; they would face as well the very personal devastation of their own bodies."],"display_date":"February 16, 1879","search_date":"1879-02-16","locations":[{"id":7313,"lat":32.364480123,"lng":-90.8603381835,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2106,"title":"Yellow Fever Strikes Kearney, Mississippi","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-05-14","end_date":"1889-05-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The letter to Stephen Duncan, a wealthy cotton and sugar planter in Natchez, was postmarked Kearney, Mississippi and began with a harried excuse.

The widespread panic alluded to in the letter could scarcely begin to describe the chaos into which Southern communities along the Mississippi river were thrown. In his documentation of the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, John Ellis describes how the disease, which began in New Orleans, spread up the river: refugees from New Orleans and those who subsequently fled other stricken communities carried the infection up the Mississippi valley in successive waves by various means of transportation. The fever broke out in Vicksburg on August 9, and three days later in appeared in the small north Mississippi railroad toward of Grenada where it struck approximately 1,050 of the town's original 2,200 residents. As the yellow fever spread, so did the terror- by the time the threat of the epidemic made its way to Memphis, twenty-five thousand people fled the city.

By the time cholera had spread southward to Virginia, the epidemic had already killed 2,200 of the 2,800 permanent residents of Quebec and decimated the populations of Detroit and New York City. Unknown to everyone, the disease was spread by polluted rivers and struck hardest where city water quality was at its worst. ","In September 1832, Elizabeth Randolph was in the thick of Richmond's own cholera outbreak. Before the disease had hit Virginia's capital, Elizabeth's father, George, had left the city to spend some time in the countryside, leaving his daughter in the care of her grandparents. Once cholera began to spread across the city, it was too dangerous for George to return to his family. No one knew where the sickness came from and how it was spread, so the best option for most families, including the Randolphs, was to stay in one place. All of Grandpapa's family think it best to remain at home...I feel that I am as safe in this place as I should be anywhere, Elizabeth wrote her father. "," As the Randolphs, both young and old, stayed cooped up at home, they kept a watchful eye out for any sign that cholera might reach them next. Slaves often caught the disease first because their water supply was the most unsanitary. Elizabeth watched in fear as coloured people around the neighborhood became ill and died. Luckily, when her grandfather's slaves became sick, it was not with cholera and the entire family breathed a sigh of relief. Elizabeth realized her father's instinct would be to return home despite the danger. Relaying a rumor she had heard, she pleaded with her father to stay away, as people from the country were thought to get sick faster than city-dwellers. Elizabeth's palpable fear serves as an example of the local chaos that followed in the wake of a cholera outbreak. No one, of any age, knew the cause or possible treatment available for those who suffered. Everyone was left to speculate about what might be done to prevent the spread of the mystery illness, and pray that their family would not be hit next."],"display_date":"September 24, 1832","search_date":"1832-09-24","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2139,"title":"The Tragedy of Slave Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-09-01","end_date":"1852-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was a grave tragedy. An enslaved African American woman of Polk County, Tennessee put an end to the lives of her children and then took her own life one September night in 1852. Authorities confirmed that the woman killed all four of her children by slitting their throats while they slept. After the gruesome deed had been carried out, she too ended her life in the same manner. When questioned about the possible basis for the woman's actions, the slave's master, George M. Garrison, alluded to the possibility that the woman may have overheard him discussing the potential sale of herself and two of her children while keeping the others in his possession. Beyond this, the owner could think of no other impetus for such an act.","Only the woman ever knew for certain the rationale which drove her to take her own life and the lives of her four children. The insinuation of her master, however, that the slave woman had knowledge of his intent to break apart her family, offers valuable insight. When viewed from this vantage point, it appears that for this mother, the possibility of a life without all of her children was just too much for her to bear. It is probable that after overhearing her master's plans to divide her family, the woman decided that ending the lives of her entire family would be less painful than separation. Based upon this speculation, it can be inferred that this heart wrenching act was committed out of desperation. ","This incident underscores the adverse impacts that the slave trade had on the African American family. The breaking up of families was not at all uncommon in the Antebellum South. Husbands and wives, parents and children were all constantly faced with the threat of separation. In his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, historian Walter Johnson claims that 50 percent of interstate slave trades tore apart nuclear families and therefore, the strength of family ties was never certain. Through examples similar to the episode above, Johnson argues that self destruction or the threat of self destruction was a common method utilized to avoid trade. According to Johnson, these instances portrayed the dark side of slave trade and served as a foundation for its opposition. In effect, this tragic account along with many others brought to light the horrors of slavery. In the bigger picture this increased awareness spawned anti-slavery reactions and eventually influenced the American abolitionist movement."],"display_date":"September 1852","search_date":"1852-09-15","locations":[{"id":12302,"lat":35.1199101303,"lng":-84.5233135097,"zoom":10,"place":"POLK, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2159,"title":"Southern Medicine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-09","end_date":"1860-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 6, 1860, Benjamin Leonard Covington Wailes, a white planter in Washington, Adams County, Mississippi, wrote a diary entry describing his son's experiences at a northern medical school. According to Wailes, his son, who attended an unspecified medical school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, resisted all efforts and persuasions used to get him to go off from the medical college with the southern students, at least two hundred of which left for southern institutions in consequence of the political excitement gotten up by the Sectionalists and disunionists. Wailes then described his feelings on the situation, indicating that he was proud of his son for not giving in to social pressures and that he was disappointed in the young men who did head back South. He felt that the United States should not be in such a state of discontent and turmoil, but his opinion was unique because most southerners did want their children to return if they had traveled to the more advanced schools of the North. "," The fact that Wailes' son attended a northern medical school was generally looked down upon by southern people and especially southern practitioners. However, due to the fact that northern schools were more advanced, many southern students traveled to attend them. This was discouraged because the idea that southern medical practice was different than northern medical practice pervaded the minds of most southerners. This theory of medical regionalism was held due to the notion that medical practices had to closely relate to certain characteristics of the patient, such as moral status, ethnicity, and gender. More specific attributes such as the climate and population of where the patient hailed from were also taken into consideration. Due to this, practitioners of the nineteenth century believed in specificity, or that ideas appropriate for one situation were not appropriate in other contexts. The general population of the South also took this belief to heart. Thus, there were different medical practices in the North and the South and southern doctors and citizens disapproved when southern students went north to learn. "," The theory of medical regionalism was not enough to compel all southern students to only attend southern medical schools. Southern practitioners and citizens pushed the idea further by strengthening the southern commitment to cultural separatism through a promotion of the ideals of the South, saying that God had given them, and only them, the ability to do great things for the world. This idea was not fool-proof for keeping southern students in the South because Wailes' son and others still traveled north to attend medical school. Differing opinions among southerners regarding the idea of secession therefore not only affected the population in terms of politics, but spread through other areas of their culture, like education, as well. These differences of opinion were brought into the forefront as the Civil War loomed and it became the issues of normal life, such as receiving an education, which finally forced people to take a stance on how they felt regarding secession."],"display_date":"January 9, 1860","search_date":"1860-01-09","locations":[{"id":6926,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2177,"title":"Death of the Respectable Adam Grove\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-24","end_date":"1842-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shermariah Church, the Presbyterian Church of Augusta County, Virginia lost a valuable member of their congregation when Mr. Adam Grove died suddenly and unexpectedly on February 24, 1842. Mr. Grove's spirituality transcended Shermariah into the educational realm in that he served as a professor of religion for 20 years. His religious beliefs manifested themselves in his charitable nature. He donated a significant portion of the land on which Shermariah Chuch was constructed and also donated funds to help build the Shermariah Academy. Unlike many of the deaths that occurred in Augusta County in the antebellum South, Mr. Grove's was unique in that he died free of debt. His lack of debt can also be attributed to his religious beliefs. Grove was very familiar with the scriptures and lived by them. One such scriptural saying was, owe no man anything.","It was said that Mr. Grove's farm reflected many of his admirable characteristics such as his good management and industrious habits. Though he possessed only a small piece of land, it was lucrative due to its high state of cultivation. At the time of Mr. Grove's death, the land was worth two to three times more than if he had bought two to three additional pieces of farmland. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Mr. Grove's death, however, is the fact that one of his servant women died about 15 minutes after he did. She was also a member of Shermariah Church and it was believed by the citizens of Augusta County that they had both gone to the same blessed reward. ","The dichotomy of this obituary lies in the fact that during life of earth, slaveholders of Augusta County treated African Americans not only as their inferiors, but as their property; meanwhile, they sat through church services in the same sanctuary. They worshipped the same god and believed that they experienced the same afterlife. The role churches played in race relations of the antebellum South is a major theme in Melvin Patrick Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>. Ely portrays a culture similar to that of this obituary, where blacks and whites attended the same churches. These churches nurtured the moral similarities of people of both races. Furthermore, according to Ely, churches leveled the playing field between whites and blacks by acknowledging the spiritual gifts of each, and by identifying their equal ability to sin. During the 1840s and 1850s, white evangelicals felt it was their duty to bring black members into their churches. Spending on ministries to slaves increased dramatically. In the Methodist Church in particular, it increased from 167,258.87 in 1829 to 1,706,207.70 by 1864. This may give us some insight as to why Mr. Grove and his servant participated in the same church service.

Captain Micajah Woods of Charlottesville delivered a stirring Memorial Day address to the people of Staunton, just twenty-two years since the Civil War. Captain Woods spoke as one who had fought in the fields as a Southern soldier during the war and could relate to the experiences of the young men lying in their graves all around him. He described how the growing economy and population of the North had seemed to overshadow the South prior to 1860. Before the war the South was characterized as reliant upon her ancestral background rather than any merit of her own, but the valiant fighting of her sons during the war proved her strength and honor. The soldiers were compared to the heroes of Thermopylae and Merathon while the Southern women were suggested as the Carthaginian maidens, allusions to the ancient world used to conjure the heroic efforts of all involved. Captain Woods reminded the Virginians mournfully viewing the graves of their loved ones that these martyrs to cause that failed have not died in vain.","  The Captain's address turned from ruminations on the past to implications for the present when he cried, It is for us to do our duty while we still live. Southerners must write their own history and not allow it to be mediated through the prejudice and judgment of alien and foreign intellect, mainly Northerners. Woods encouraged all present to record their memories of battles and the names of their lost sons as this knowledge of heroic deeds will allow the South to retain its image of glory. This allowed Virginians to rest secure in the knowledge that Virginia could rise again to bravely fight should she be threatened by an invading foe. Following his address, Captain Woods was presented with flowers on behalf of a Northern lady whose husband fought in the Union. The Captain responded to her gift by describing how the blue and the grey would join together to fight should the need arise and vie with the other in defense of a common flag and the honor of a common country.","  The Memorial Day address closed with contradictory assertions of the new bonds existing between the North and the South and the declaration of the South's brilliance in comparison with the North. These opposing attitudes support historian Michael Perman's argument for the contradiction that formed the core of the federal Reconstruction policy in which the North used radical policies to enact traditional goals. The South was consequently left to function with a novel political system set up as though nothing had changed. Captain Woods's address illustrated an awareness of this dichotomy with a speech containing ruminations of past glory in combination with a conscious declaration of Virginia's role in the Union. Reconstruction united the North and the South politically, but the Union did not extend to public opinion. On that day of remembering, it is obvious that the Southerners were still very aware of the Northern attitudes that led to their succession in the first place.

Guiteau was delivered at the courthouse on the morning of the twenty-third of January. Although the court officers continually shouted for silence, Guiteau never ceased his criticisms of the court and Judge Porter even as the judge read off the charges against him. Judge Porter compared Guiteau to John Wilkes Booth, suggesting that the murderer of Lincoln shared with Guiteau a desire to win notoriety at any cost. Guiteau was accused of the assassination of President Garfield, with his only real hope of defense lying in a plea of insanity. The jury declared Guiteau guilty as indicted, followed by applause from the crowd and Guiteau's statement that the verdict was an outrage upon the American people.","   The Valley Virginian described the popularity of this trial that enthralled the entire public for the entire eleven weeks of its duration. Though guilty, sympathy often awaits the condemned as the consequences of the verdict come to be considered. However, the case of John W. Guiteau evoked less public sympathy than any crime resulting in capital punishment before it. The desire for a guilty verdict was universal as the nation felt that its own character, as well as the fate of the miserable assassin, was on trial. ","   The Virginian's editorial on the verdict of the case spoke to the faith of Augusta County in the legal system and its desire to protect the president of the nation. Though a national event, the Staunton newspaper published its own thoughts on the outcome of the trial, trying to reconcile the pity felt for those sentenced to a public execution and the outrage of an assassination. The strength of the public outcry upon Garfield's assassination is ironic considering he won the 1880 presidential election against Winfield Scott Hancock with a plurality of only ten thousand out of more than nine million votes. Garfield was the Republican candidate carrying most of the Northern states and none of the former slave states, including Virginia. James Garfield was not installed in office for much time before his assassination; historian James M. McPherson details how he was consequently unable to fully enact his plans to form coalitions between the Republican Party and the newly forming independent parties in the South. The outrage of Guiteau's actions described by The Virginian was not due to admiration for Garfield, but for the office he held. Though the South was often suspicious of Northern attitudes, they were bound enough to the Union to have an emotional investment in its commander-in-chief.

Wilson Goings, after listening to the quarrel outside his home, asked Brown inside. Middlebrook's wife was in the house and when Middlebrook was denied entry to the residence he became furious and tried to force his way inside. He managed to open the door enough to fire his pistol and hit Goings, resulting in a severe arm wound. Middlebrook then made his way to another door, gained entrance, and fatally wounded Brown.","   Elzy Middlebrook was arrested on Sunday morning without any attempt at escape. He was indicted on Monday for murder and malicious maiming, all a result of his suspicious love for his wife, barely mentioned throughout the article. The Valley Virginian specifically indicates that all of the parties involved [were] colored.","   The newspaper's report on the race of the individuals involved in the crime is essential to understanding its significance. It is an assertion that violent actions of this sort occur only within a certain set of people, implying that white Americans could rise above such crimes of passions. While under slavery Middlebrook was obliged to accept his wife's sexual contact with men other than himself due to his subservience under his master, his new freedom granted him the liberty to defend what he believed should be rightfully his. The wife becomes a question of property, evident in her absence in the reporting of the incident, and Middlebrook had a right to his property. Steven Hahn contends that the South following the Civil War was formed out of black struggles such as this one, illustrating the nature and complexity of race relations in the nineteenth century. The racial identification is indication of a level of racial prejudice, but the Middlebrook's indictment and trial indicate the due process of law given to every criminal regardless of race.

At six o'clock on June 30, 1883, Mr. Elam and Mr. Beirne met one another to settle the score as gentlemen always had before - with a duel. The procedure was decided in advance, specifying the use of Colt's six-shooters at eight paces. All men not directly involved with the business were asked to leave and the location was clear of lawful authorities due to the early hour. Once the physician questioned the two men for readiness, they had to discharge their weapons between the yell of Fire and the count to three.

Once Mr. Elam realized that his wound was only in one leg, he wished that he had demanded a third shot. Though not fatal, Elam's injury to his upper right thigh would be dangerous to repair because the bullet had embed itself in his flesh. Following the duel, both parties appeared calm and collected, content that the shots had not proven fatal. There had been no attempt to arrest or even investigate the battle after its occurrence, though their original meeting had been delayed due to three attempts to arrest Beirne.","  Antidueling laws rarely functioned to stop the duel because most law enforcement officials acknowledged that the men of honor fighting in such battles were held to a different code. Historian Kenneth Greenberg claims that men of honor valued their words and their views of the truth above all else; consequently, they were willing to fight to defend a public appearance. However, after the Civil War dueling began to be replaced by shooting-on-sight, promoted by the fact that in some areas of the South almost everyone kept a pistol. Immediate shooting lacks the equality of opportunity provided by a duel, revealing an act of vengeance based on impatient emotion. Mr. Elam and Mr. Beirne chose not to publicize the reasons for their duel, but the choice of method clearly demonstrates that it was a question of honor, thus supporting Greenberg's contention. Following the bloodthirsty violence of the Civil War, anything less than honor would be settled with an informal shot at one's enemy.

The incident arose outside the church because three men, Seth Lowe, Will Phillips, and John Howard all loved a local Arkansas girl, Miss Irene Pruitt. They attended the same prayer meeting that evening. Miss Pruitt arrived at the location with Phillips, and soon thereafter met Lowe and Howard just outside the church. When Miss Pruitt went inside, the men began to quarrel over her, escalating from argument to physical brawl when Howard and Lowe both jumped on Phillips. Phillips then reportedly shot Howard, through the body with a pistol he had on his person. In quick succession, Lowe fired at Phillips with his gun, hitting him in his lower back. Once Phillips had fallen to the ground due to the impact of the bullet, he managed to aim accurately enough at Lowe to fatally wound him in the shoulder. The New York Times reported that the scene concluded with a panic in [the] church and stated finally that, All three men are fatally injured."," Many Southern men carried guns, and of those who did, it seems they did not hesitate to use them. Historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris hint to one of the causes for these public, and almost casual, acts of aggression, Southerners have a much more positive attitude towards gun ownership. Because more southern men had loaded weapons on them, they were more likely to shoot someone on a day to day basis. During the late 1800s, a journalist named Horace Victor Eugene Redfield conducted a diligent study on homicide rates entitled, Homicide, North and South. In this study, he compared the homicide rates of states in both the North and South, traveling all over the county to collect his data. Results of his research showed that criminal homicides in a given state were much higher in the South in comparison to the North. In 1964 Arkansas had a 3.7 percent homicide rate for every population of 100,000 while New York only had 1.7 percent."," Redfield found patterns of southern homicide in his research. He emphasized that homicide was promoted by gun policy in the South: He saw the most general cause of southern violence as a lack of regard for human life...as did the unnecessary carrying of weapons, particularly concealed weapons. Lowe, Phillips, and Howard were southern men with concealed weapons. Redfield also noted in his findings that white homicide in the south at this time was more prominent than black; all three men in the shooting of December 1, 1897 were white males. "," Nineteenth-century southern violence, according to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, had a common catalyst: insult to honor, or personal ego. Words often escalated quickly to violence which is demonstrated by the incident over Miss Pruitt at Little Rock. Correlations were found between a southern emphasis on honor related values and homicide rates in the1800s. The post Civil War era tradition of a duel, commonly associated with honor, was replaced by a more abrupt and free-form style of violence according to Wilson and Ferris: fighting, shooting, stabbing, feuding, and shotgun weddings were considered legitimate and inevitable results of honor confronting honor."," Ironically, this particular incident took place outside a church door when, honor, necessarily a secular system of values, clashed with the ideals of Christian virtue. In the same day, The New York Times also printed a story detailing the Protestant Episcopal Church's outrage at the sense of danger which threatens the character of our people, in light of recent murders. Bishop Capers of this Church stated in the paper that, such murders as have of late outraged the law of God, [and] desecrated the sacredness of life.

The services available ranged from the treatment of a blister at 50 cents to the amputation of a thigh or leg for 20 to 30 dollars. Included in the document are clarifications on the price difference for treating a white person and a black person.

Twenty physicians then signed the agreement. The writing of this document by the regular practitioners of medicine in the county supports Todd Savitt's claim in <em>Fevers, agues, and cures: Medical Life in Old Virginia</em> that the medical profession was not an easy one in Virginia in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Patients called on doctors at all hours of the day in all variety of weather conditions, to tend to the needs of the sick in their community. Additionally, while they would provide services at any time, they would in general not be paid until a given point in the year. The establishment of medical societies such as the one in Culpeper, had both social and practical purposes. As Savitt points out, the medical societies provided both intellectual and communal support to physicians, as they exchanged knowledge about medicine and treatments or simply socialized with each other. According to Savitt city- and county-wide societies existed in Richmond, Charlottesville, Winchester, Petersburg, Fredericksburg, and Norfolk and in numerous counties throughout Virginia. Additionally, the societies provided some protection from economic competition to their members and distinguished the regular physicians from herbal healers and contrivers that were found throughout the South."],"display_date":"April 17, 1852","search_date":"1852-04-17","locations":[{"id":13759,"lat":38.4860604965,"lng":-77.9559434026,"zoom":9,"place":"CULPEPER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2234,"title":"Adie and the Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-08","end_date":"1888-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["B. W. Adie wrote to his sister from Camden, Missouri on Janurary 9, 1888 after a lull in their family correspondence. He told his sister that he was recently employed by the Chicago Santa Fe and California Railroad. His main concern regarding this job was the weather in Missouri: you can rest assured it's cold enough. I have caught a bad cold and am not at work this morning. Adie did not mention much else of consequence in his letter except to inquire if another relation was also still employed in the Railroad business. He signed off the short letter by saying, give my love to all. I have nothing to say that would interest you so may as well stop writing these few lines excepting to let you know I am still in the land of the living. "," Before the Civil War, 96 percent of railroad manufacturers were northern based, and throughout the war, the North used their railroads much more successfully than the South. After the war, southern railroads were, almost devastated; much of their rolling stock was gone, and many tracks, stations, and bridges were ruined, according to the Robert O'Brien. But with the help of the federal government that sold cheap military railroad property to the South, along with, northern money and northern iron being poured into the south, by the 1880s and 90s, the railroad industry was at its peak growth point: 70,000 miles of track were laid in the 1880s alone. Historian John B. Boles observed that at this time the railroad grew to an extent matched by few independent nations; and trade networks proliferated and the volume of goods increased apace. The same text acknowledged the growth of railroads not only in places like Missouri where Adie was, but other southern states like Georgia, They quickly understood that railroads held the key to economic development: the rails that carried lumber out could also carry persons and goods back in. As the population of the region grew and the open range shrank, commercial agriculture took root with the railroads."," Adie was reasonably proud of his position on a railroad, since it was one of the only booming southern industries at the time. However, working conditions were still tough on actual railroad workers, especially with such a high demand for railroads in the late 1800s. Places like Missouri were often cold in comparison to the deep South, and men like Adie who were subject to the outdoor physical labor that railroad work required could easily get sick. Labor conditions for railroad work were often less than satisfactory, causing the railroad industry to be one of the first birth places for worker unions. There were particularly violent strikes in 1877 and 1894 over work wages, hours, and conditions. Adie reported working on the railroad just after the first strike, and a year after the Federal Railroad Administration was commissioned to ensure that safety regulations were followed for railroad labor in 1887. In this temporary lull of appeasement in between the strikes, even though he might have been prone to catch cold, Adie's actual labor conditions should have been better than before. "," As the twentieth century drew near, railroads became more regulated. In 1887 The Interstate Commerce Act put railroads under the financial supervision of federal institutions. By the Progressive area (post-1900s), the railroad became such a hugely prominent money making industry, that it eventually developed into a popular breeding ground for corruption and monopolies.

The incident arose outside the church because three men, Seth Lowe, Will Phillips, and John Howard all loved a local Arkansas girl, Miss Irene Pruitt. They attended the same prayer meeting that evening. Miss Pruitt arrived at the location with Phillips, and soon thereafter met Lowe and Howard just outside the church. When Miss Pruitt went inside, the men began to quarrel over her, escalating from argument to physical brawl when Howard and Lowe both jumped on Phillips. Phillips then reportedly shot Howard, through the body with a pistol he had on his person. In quick succession, Lowe fired at Phillips with his gun, hitting him in his lower back. Once Phillips had fallen to the ground due to the impact of the bullet, he managed to aim accurately enough at Lowe to fatally wound him in the shoulder. The New York Times reported that the scene concluded with a panic in [the] church and stated finally that, All three men are fatally injured."," Many Southern men carried guns, and of those who did, it seems they did not hesitate to use them. Historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris hint to one of the causes for these public, and almost casual, acts of aggression, Southerners have a much more positive attitude towards gun ownership. Because more southern men had loaded weapons on them, they were more likely to shoot someone on a day to day basis. During the late 1800s, a journalist named Horace Victor Eugene Redfield conducted a diligent study on homicide rates entitled, Homicide, North and South. In this study, he compared the homicide rates of states in both the North and South, traveling all over the county to collect his data. Results of his research showed that criminal homicides in a given state were much higher in the South in comparison to the North. In 1964 Arkansas had a 3.7 percent homicide rate for every population of 100,000 while New York only had 1.7 percent."," Redfield found patterns of southern homicide in his research. He emphasized that homicide was promoted by gun policy in the South: He saw the most general cause of southern violence as a lack of regard for human life...as did the unnecessary carrying of weapons, particularly concealed weapons. Lowe, Phillips, and Howard were southern men with concealed weapons. Redfield also noted in his findings that white homicide in the south at this time was more prominent than black; all three men in the shooting of December 1, 1897 were white males. "," Nineteenth-century southern violence, according to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, had a common catalyst: insult to honor, or personal ego. Words often escalated quickly to violence which is demonstrated by the incident over Miss Pruitt at Little Rock. Correlations were found between a southern emphasis on honor related values and homicide rates in the1800s. The post Civil War era tradition of a duel, commonly associated with honor, was replaced by a more abrupt and free-form style of violence according to Wilson and Ferris: fighting, shooting, stabbing, feuding, and shotgun weddings were considered legitimate and inevitable results of honor confronting honor."," Ironically, this particular incident took place outside a church door when, honor, necessarily a secular system of values, clashed with the ideals of Christian virtue. In the same day, The New York Times also printed a story detailing the Protestant Episcopal Church's outrage at the sense of danger which threatens the character of our people, in light of recent murders. Bishop Capers of this Church stated in the paper that, such murders as have of late outraged the law of God, [and] desecrated the sacredness of life. In Arkansas and many other southern regions during this time, white male homicide and violence was a large problem and clashed with white southern Christian ideals."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-01","locations":[{"id":752,"lat":34.7798418653,"lng":-92.3166533878,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2240,"title":"Widow made executrix of 3,500,00 property","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-12-01","end_date":"1897-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 1, 1897 the papers of the recently deceased John E. Ligget declared his widow the sole executrix of his account. This meant that she had exclusive control over seeing that the provisions of Mr. Ligget's will were satisfied, and had control over all other matters concerning the deceased's estate. Mr. Liggett was a wealthy tobacconist, and upon his death, relinquished his entire estate in St. Louis, Missouri valued at 3,500,000 to Mrs. Liggett. ","The legal status of women in the nineteenth across America was still far below their male counterparts. Edward Pessen noted that this was particularly the case in marriage at this time, where women were often even considered their husband's property in the eyes of the law, and denied many of the same property rights. These social and legal constrictions made it very hard for women like Mrs. Ligget to come into sole possession of any property at all because normally, as Pessen remarks frankly, the wife is dead in law. This suggests that even inheriting property easily turned into an uncertain ordeal in the nineteenth century, because if a man contested a woman's rights to the property, it is very likely the law would recognize his claim over a female's. "," In Pessen's view of women's legal status in the 1800s, Mrs. Ligget is an exception to the general law applications in the nineteenth century. One explanation for this, however, could be that her fortunate property circumstance was affected by where she lived. St. Louis was a growing industrial city, and often cities were not only the first to shift to modern economics, they also tended to be ahead of many rural areas when it came to social and legal reforms. Significant changes in women's rights occurred in the early twentieth-century, so it's possible that St. Louis, as a modernizing city, already began to broaden the legal liberties given to women at the time of Mrs. Leggit's inheritance. The fact that she was of a high social class also could have helped her bypass some legal restrictions against the female possession of the estate after Mr. Leggit's death. "," Though Mrs. Ligget's property circumstance may have been unique to places like St. Louis, it was not uncommon for tobacconists like the Ligget's to hold a high economic status in the post-bellum south at large. One of several economic booms for tobacco companies as a prosperous industry came right after the Civil War. Men like Washington Duke who developed a machine that could produce two hundred cigarettes per minute and Julius Carr who sold about five million pounds of tobacco in a year, proved that the tobacco trade was lucrative in an industrializing South. "," The fact that a woman was on the receiving end of such a profitable business, especially one that functioned on a national level, marked the beginning of a shift toward women's legal rights. Before the Civil War, southern women were often unable to be a significant part of anything politically or economically meaningful. During the Civil War this mentality changed for many southern women, and as Elizabeth Hayes Turner observed in John B. Bowles's A Companion to the American South, roles that formerly had belonged to men blurred as women assumed control over children and slaves, in the absence of their husbands. As the war came to a close, women became more prominent figures in the management and labor of textile mills in particular. With this modification of the social and economic role of women, by the end of the war Confederate soldiers came home to a new woman. But, for the most part it was not until later in the twentieth-century that they were willing to fully recognize it."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-01","locations":[{"id":7921,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2254,"title":"Death, Love, and War","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-06-30","end_date":"1861-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The operation was dangerous: destroying a bridge near a railroad ten miles away from camp in Martinsville, Virginia.

A group was organized to track him down. ","Although the man was first considered to be George Parish (an at-the-time, recently released convict), John H. Bigus was charged with the assault.

Lynching occurred over whipping and beating when the social order of white society was attacked. The example Brundage uses to support this is the assault of a white woman. Bigus' case shows how such an act would not be permitted. The perpetrator of the act was in question. Three different men were implicated throughout the ordeal: George Parish, John H.

W. Hatch wrote a letter to W. W. Cook of Mississippi telling him of a yellow fever epidemic that was causing fear and panic throughout the Clinton community. The population dropped from between 1,500 to 2,000 people to 250, some of whom died and some of whom had fled to the country. At the time of the letter, 46 people were receiving treatment, five of whom had been diagnosed in the past 24 hours. The religious base of the community, preachers and the like, fled. Instead, volunteers from the Masonic Brethren and other parts of the community stepped in to help the sick, and doctors and nurses came from New Orleans and Mississippi. The sickness spread throughout the region with reports of cases in Woodville, Baton Rouge, Bayou Sarah, and Port Hudson. Hatch wrote that the air was finally beginning to cool and that he hoped soon there would be a frost; this would make conditions less conducive to the sickness.","Hatch reported that those who fled to the country suffered the worst from epidemic because they lacked access to medical care. He also said that a disadvantage of being in town was a lack of food, for the country people would neither come nor send to Town because they feared contamination. Hatch sent a boy to the country to buy a chicken and said that the boy had to wait for the farmers to catch and kill the chickens and then leave before he was able to collect it. The farmers did not want to be near anyone from town. At the time of his letter, Hatch reported that, despite the shortage of food, he and his family were all well and in fine Spirits; however, twelve days after he wrote his letter, B.W. Hatch died of yellow fever. Hatch was a victim of Louisiana's most serious yellow fever epidemic. The epidemic killed around 12,000 people in New Orleans alone. Even more people died in rural areas, giving Louisiana the single highest death rate of any state in the country for any single year of the nineteenth century. People fled from the cities to escape the sickness. Although the rural areas did have less sickness, they also had fewer doctors-making chances of recovery even slimmer.","Doctors often were unsure about how to treat the sickness, trying a variety of medicines and even going as far as to bleed their patients. Until the early twentieth century, doctors had no idea what caused yellow fever; nor did they know for certain if it was contagious. Many towns attempted to quarantine residents, convinced they would be able to contain epidemics this way. But, as Walter Reed discovered in 1900, yellow fever was not transmitted by humans but by insects, and thus efforts to quarantine always failed. Yellow fever caused epidemics everywhere in the United States throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, though it took its hardest toll in the South. The largest epidemic in the North was in Philadelphia in 1793 where two thousand people died. Epidemics were much more common in the South; port towns such as New Orleans, Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; Norfolk, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; and Galveston, Texas were especially susceptible because of the high number of disease carrying mosquitoes in areas-throughout the nineteenth century all of these areas had their own epidemics similar to Louisiana's in 1853. Besides causing widespread death, the fever would also cause commercial problems. Communities would blockade themselves from the world to keep out the disease. Goods and passengers were unable to enter communities that were affected with the fever, nor were they allowed to leave. Businesses would close both from a lack of goods and customers, and also from a fear of the fever. Once an epidemic of yellow fever occurred in the South, public health officials all over the region would be charged with preventing the importation of the disease from the infected area, thereby limiting the chance of a local epidemic. But they also had to keep trade going at the same time-a difficult and almost impossible task. The disruption of trade would often cause the largest uproar after the end of an epidemic; people exclaimed that after all the death and ruin of the economy, a cure must be found.

One morning during the war, Woods was standing guard as a picket. As the sun rose, one of his fellow soldiers kindly offered to fill his post, while the hungry Woods made breakfast for himself. While he was cooking, an officer approached him and asked him to help with the removal of trash and animal bones from the encampment. After politely declining, saying he was standing picket, the officer proceeded to vociferously curse the boy out, drawing the attention of many in the camp, including General Jackson. The temperamental General ordered for ten balls to be blown through the d----d rascal. When none of the soldiers would comply with this order, Jackson court marshaled the boy on charges of mutiny and desertion, found him guilty, and sentenced him to be shot.","Soon after the end of the war, the United States Senate, prompted by rumors of multiple events like the death of Woods, launched an investigation into the conduct of General Jackson during the First Seminole War. Abner Lacock, a member of the investigation panel, personally came to the conclusion that General Jackson had an innate love of 'blood and carnage' and felt the need to tell the nation about his misconduct. Lacock authored A Letter to the People of Pennsylvania detailing General Jackson's misconduct. In this letter, he narrates the events leading up to the death of Woods, among others, and claims that Jackson deliberately lied time and again to explain his brutal and unwarranted actions.","The First Seminole War was conducted on one of the frontiers of America, and one that was characterized by nearly constant violence. It was a war easily won, but with questionable goals. The end result was the sale of Florida to the United States, a result to which the United States denied aspiring; rather, Secretary of War Calhoun sent General Jackson to Fort Scott in 1818 to wage war on the Seminoles as retribution for attacks against whites-soldiers and civilians alike-in retaliation for General Gaines' sacking of an Indian town. General Jackson had public designs from the outset to rain punishment on the 'savages' inhabiting Florida.

Sam advised his son to pursue the profession of medicine. As Sam explained it, becoming a doctor would not prevent him from being a farmer. Rather, Sam found it vitally in your advantage to be acquainted with the science of medicine, and it is an easy profession to acquire. According to historian James Volo, the medical profession in the antebellum period thought of itself as knowledgeable and humanitarian, but its practitioners were neither selective in their methods nor well regulated by their fellows. Such methods were still based upon medieval concepts and home remedies. A country doctor-which William would be if he returned to Clark County, Alabama-was even less advanced in practical methods due to the lack to intellectual stimulation from living in rural areas. In other words, even though studying to become a doctor would be respectable and considered knowledgeable for William, it would still be an easy profession, as Sam stated, for him to acquire.","Sam Forwood's reasoning behind his advice was that he knew about the hardships that farmers in Alabama faced at the time. As William Rogers explains, in Alabama, one of the states making up the Cotton Kingdom, the fluctuation of cotton prices, the higher cost of purchasing goods in a protected market, and the lack of economic development and diversification contribute to the unsettled economic conditions that characterized the time. The uncertainty of farming - when it would rain, how much it would rain, etc. - dominated letters among antebellum southern planters. Sam Forwood himself exclaimed anxiety about his crop of cotton being small, yet hopefully highly priced. Focusing on another profession, William Forwood could ease his dependence on this lifestyle of ambiguity. Although doctors belonged to what would be considered the white elite class, they still depended upon the agricultural success of the Cotton Kingdom. Certainly, doctors were a very separate occupation, which only served to build up the resources in a local society. Nevertheless, such occupations still depended on Alabama's economic vitality, which undoubtedly depended on cotton. With this in mind, William could still find time for farming-that occupation upon which southern society hinged. William Forwood did take his father's advice. In 1848, he returned to Alabama to pursue the medical profession. Later on in life, he served as the president of the Clark County Medical Society and published several articles in medical journals."],"display_date":"October 8, 1846","search_date":"1846-10-08","locations":[{"id":78,"lat":31.6767353507,"lng":-87.8307270777,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2345,"title":"Sam Forwood&#39;s Definition of the Southern Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-05-07","end_date":"1840-05-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 7, 1840, Sam Forwood, in Clark County, Alabama, wrote to his son William on the health of his family.

In this correspondence, the first paragraph tended to discuss the health of all members of the family and the history of any sicknesses since the last letter. The Forwood family was generally in sufficient health, despite a fever here and there. However, in this letter, Sam chose to include the conditions of his slaves. He wrote, My family is in good health except one negro woman and a little negro boy over two years old. The black woman had been plagued by a slight fever, and the young slave boy had broken a bone rough-housing with some of the other slave children. Following this mention, Sam continued his letter with the normal discussion of his cotton crop and other business around Clark County.","This is not an exception in the history of southern slavery. Slave owners often included slaves as a part of their household. As Edward Ayers points out, in most instances, masters and slaves mutually cared for one another, and masters would grieve for slaves as a member for the family. Because the idea of family was so important in the southern Christian culture, masters frequently included their slaves in their notion of their family unit. The inclusion would, in theory, civilize the slaves with Christian influences because slaves who respected their masters-as children who respect their fathers-would never seek to harm them. Furthermore, the slaves' own family units, like those of their masters, kept a degree of humanity and happiness instilled in the plantation dynamics.","Moreover, slaves were the livelihood of southern plantation owners, and thus owners were necessarily concerned about the health of their slaves. According to William Roger, slavery was an indispensable component of the cotton kingdom, and so, the success of an Alabama plantation and the success of its owner rested upon the slaves. Surely, a slave with a broken bone or a fever was of no use.

On September 18 of that year, Joseph Hawley, a railroad executive in Galveston, wrote to his wife and daughter to share details of the ruin caused by the hurricane that hit the coastal region 10 days earlier. While Hawley sent news that their immediate family had thankfully managed to survive the storm, he described the wreckage and dead bodies that still plagued the city streets. Indeed, Hawley had to deal with this devastation on a daily basis as chairman of the Committee of Public Safety. The storm hit in the afternoon, giving him enough time to take precautionary measures to protect his property; he estimated the resulting personal damages to be minimal, around 200. The storm flooded his office with four feet of standing water and at the time of the letter, he estimated that the storm and its effects had killed five thousand citizens and injured three thousand others.","Hawley told his family of uncovering the bodies of family friends while at the morgue and overseeing the handling of 500 bodies which were taken out to sea, weighted down and thrown overboard. There had been so many fatalities that the city had to resort to collecting the bodies and either taking them out into the ocean or cremating them in large funeral pyres. The situation was grim as there was a limited supply of clean water and much of the area was still flooded, with filth accumulating and baking under the hot temperatures. While the city deployed two thousand men a day to assist in clean up efforts, Hawley estimated that it would take at least another four to five weeks before the initial clean-up was complete. Despite the great work ahead, Hawley concluded his letter on an optimistic tone, noting that Galveston would overcome the disaster and rebuild itself into a modern city. He also commented on the great outpouring of donations and financial assistance from neighboring areas as well as places as far away as Paris, Liverpool and Hamburg.","By 1900, the coastal city of Galveston had a population of almost 38,000 and was a thriving, wealthy city, serving as a banking center and vital deepwater port; it was also a major producer of cotton, wheat, cattle and corn. Prior to the Galveston Hurricane, two previous hurricanes resulted in the devastation and eventual abandonment of a city further along the coast, called Indianola; yet the people of Galveston had not really seen hurricanes as a legitimate threat. While discussions of precautions such as seawalls had been discussed, no safety measures had been taken and the area was completely vulnerable by the time the hurricane of 1900 rolled in.","The storm hit on September 8 and massive flooding occurred, exacerbated by the fact that the highest house in the city was only eight or nine feet above sea level.No exact death toll is available, but most estimates range anywhere from six thousand to eight thousand with financial damages totaling 28 million. While the physical damage was concentrated in one particular region of Texas, the resulting financial burden was shouldered by many as nearby communities and even other countries contributed money to aid in the large rebuilding effort that lay before Galveston. After the storm, the city began enacting changes immediately, including a reorganization of the local government to help relieve Galveston of its now heavy debt. In 1902, locals voted into effect legislation which issued 1.5 million in bonds to pay for the construction of a 17-foot-tall seawall. This barricade between the city and the ocean would prove successful in offering crucial protection during a powerful hurricane that hit in 1915. Despite rebuilding efforts and improvements, the devastation Galveston faced caused it to lag behind cities such as Dallas and Houston which were developing into transportation hubs and enjoying the new oil boom. Due to its extensive financial and human costs, the 1900 storm is still considered to be the deadliest natural disaster to hit the North American continent."],"display_date":"September 8, 1900 - September 18, 1900","search_date":"1900-09-13","locations":[{"id":12779,"lat":29.5143972393,"lng":-94.8756973573,"zoom":9,"place":"GALVESTON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2379,"title":"Yellow Fever Takes Southern Cities by Storm\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-09-17","end_date":"1878-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer and fall of 1878, yellow fever took the Gulf Coast by storm. Cities all over the lower South were experiencing high numbers of deaths from the terrible illness. On September 17, in Mobile County, two more citizens were diagnosed with yellow fever and died, leaving the Mobile residents in a panic. The victims resided in the section of the city bound by Beauregard, State, and Conception Streets-the area in which the majority of the other cases had been reported. Fortunately, however, there had only been five cases of yellow fever reported in Mobile since Dr. William Ross diagnosed a patient on August 16, a case which also ended in death. Until these deaths, Mobile seemed to be faring well with the illness in comparison to other cities in the Gulf Coast region. However, in addition to the two fatal cases officially reported to the board of health on September 17, another case was reported just a day later. Mobile would have to cope with the spread of this deadly illness along with the rest of the Gulf Coast, although not to the same extent. In New Orleans, for example, there had been 195 cases reported and fifty-five deaths on September 16 alone. The plague traveled up along the Mississippi River from the coast, spreading to Vicksburg, Memphis, Cincinnati, and other towns bordering the river.","This was not the first season of terrible medical records in the South. Between 1650 and 1900, yellow fever swept the Gulf Coast in repetitive waves. The disease tended to thrive in the area, with its tropical humid climate, and came in epidemics. Yellow fever was a particularly daunting epidemic in that it was characterized by a sudden onset, and if fatal, death within a week to ten days. Therefore, doctors like Dr. William Ross found it extremely difficult to treat or cure because by the time one was diagnosed, patients were either almost dead or recovering naturally. In the Gulf Coast region, the fever tended to come in the warmest months of the year. Therefore, many citizens fled from Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida during the summer and fall months in an attempt to escape the fever. Fortunately for blacks, their Barbados and African ancestry made them less susceptible to the disease than white people, so they were often able to remain at home without fear of catching the fatal virus. These bouts of yellow fever along the Gulf Coast continued until the great epidemic of New   Orleans in 1905, and then the disease seemed to fade away. The yellow fever took many a Southern life and was a constant source of fear for the region's residents."],"display_date":"September 17, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-17","locations":[{"id":286,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2383,"title":"Train Crash in Clarksville, Tennessee","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-08-14","end_date":"1869-08-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Eight miles outside of Clarksville Tennessee, a train shattered into splinters.

The impact was so severe that it killed four people and wounded forty to fifty people. The locomotive, caboose, express and baggage car, two passenger coaches, and one sleeping-car all burned down and creating 300,000 worth of damage. "," By the time of the train crash in1869, Tennessee railroads were dangerous because they were poorly kept. Historian Robert Corlew noted approximately 1,200 miles of railroads were built in Tennessee during the decade of the 1850s. They of course offered great potential for improvement and expansion of the state's economy when the Civil War came. The state of Tennessee invested a significant amount to build railroads all over Tennessee throughout the eighteenth century. Yet the damage from the Civil War was so detrimental to the railroad companies that after 1865 many of them could not continue construction. The state-aid system of Tennessee went into a debt of forty-three million dollars, much of which was attributed to their investments in railroads. "," Private railroad companies tried to pick up where state-aid funded companies left off. Their main focus was to connect the old railroad parts built before the war and form greater networks. Edward Ayers in remarks Throughout the 1870s and early 1880's Southern Railroad companies experimented with ways to accommodate themselves to the different widths of track between North and South Thus, the old and new railroad tracks built by various companies varied in size durability and reliability."," With such a high priority on connecting networks and small allotment of funding, companies sometimes overlooked the upkeep of the railroads. Even with the economy still in debt from railroad spending, Tennesseans still relied on the system. Consumers frequently used it overlooking the risks. Railroad companies prioritized the rapid networking of interstate transportation over safety. Few wanted to expend the time or money to inspect the durability of the tracks built before the war by other companies; all they wanted to do was connect them and get them up and running. "," Once they accomplished this, the railroads were very popular, despite the dangers. Southerners depended highly on railroads throughout the South for trade, commerce and rapid transportation. Private companies struggled to improve the economy building a network of train tracks as fast as they could. They filled the gaps between old tracks, but lacked in their focus on keeping the old tracks secure. Nobody checked the status of the bridge outside Clarksville before passing 300,000 dollars worth of goods over it.

She left her two daughters at home in Knoxville, Illinois, and for over a year helped the wounded at war directly on the battlefield. "," Mrs. Holstead tended to Union soldiers in hospitals and tented fields. During an evacuation provoked by the confederates in Corinth, Mississippi, she paused during all the chaos to stop and care for the wounded during the battle. As a result she had to travel alone by horseback through Tennessee day and night, in the opposing rival's territory using an article of clothing for a pillow to sleep outside at night."," In the next six months after her adventure she served as the matron for the hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. Because of her firsthand experience on the front, she moved to the general hospital in Franklin, Tennessee, thinking she could be of more use in a place few women would wish to occupy. Nashville's The Federal Knapsack reported that since Mrs. Holstead switched, the Franklin hospital improved in cleanliness and neatness."," What made Mrs. Holstead such a hero was her willingness to remain in enemy territory by herself to administer aid to the wounded. Even after her experiences she agreed to move to Franklin, Tennessee to help the union hospital there. "," While men went to fight for their country, the women were left to tend homes and children and worry. The women who believed just as strongly in the war cause as their husbands did not just sit back and watch as men died. Women who wanted a more active role either took their passions to the battlefields or organized hospitals. Just in New York City, April 25, 1861, several prominent women already collected to start the Women's Central Relief Association. They planned the distribution of medical and other supplies to soldiers in camps and battlefields. Some also worked to improve the government's transportation system of the sick and wounded soldiers. Historian Katie Ross argues that many times the sick and wounded lay unattended and often unprotected for days on the battlefield or river's edge waiting for transportation down the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers to hospitals along the Ohio. Most Union nurses remained in northern territory.

Dilue Harris, a young white girl, packed up her belongings and left her home with her family. They began to encounter trouble when they attempted to cross the Trinity River. The water level of the river and the crowds of people made it difficult to cross. The water got so high that it flooded over the river banks and left the Harris family and many others to wait for a ferry, all the while the river water swirling around them. Rampant disease intensified the difficulty of the escape. Harris's sister fell ill and died after the trip across the river. Her family buried her in Liberty, one of the cities through which they passed. Texans continued to move northward until they heard news of the Texas victory at San Jacinto. ","This flight of the Texans from their homes became known as the Runaway Scrape. Texas had involved herself in a war with Mexico, its goal being an independent Texas. Trouble had been brewing between the Mexicans and Anglo-Americans for some time. Cultural differences played a part, as did the emancipation of slaves in Mexico in 1829, and a law of 1830 which stopped colonization of Texas, and provided for the collecting of custom duties and garrisoning of troops in Texas. Once involved in the conflict, Texas found herself up against Santa Anna's powerful army and not faring well. After the fall of the Alamo, Houston feared the worst for Texans and wanted them out of the way of the Mexican army. ","The Runaway Scrape was complete bedlam as a mass of Texas families packed up what they could and took off in their wagons. Many men were gone fighting, and so the women had to do the best that they could on their own. The conditions were poor as people were confined to the close quarters of their wagons. Highly contagious diseases like measles and whooping cough afflicted many of the refugees, and families were forced to bury dead members en route then continue on their way. The Runaway Scrape was fraught with fear and danger and became a defining event in the history of Texas.

The diary of Dr. Walter Wade proved that even in the mid-nineteenth century that this concept was not a foreign one. A large percentage of his journal was dedicated to a documentation of his private medical records. In a February 21, 1848 entry, Wade described his Monday night visit to a woman named Sarah. Wade devoted few words to the entry, but his impact was nonetheless powerful. He succinctly stated that, Sarah had an abortion at 3 mos. Wade provided the reader with sparse details about Sarah, but he did mention that the terminated pregnancy had consisted of twins. However, he was unable to learn the gender of the pair, presumably because the pregnancy was not far enough advanced. Wade maintained a business-like and professional tone throughout the passage; one can only assume that this detached air his writing emanated was reflected in his actions as a physician."," An individual's livelihood was undoubtedly unstable in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of, High infant mortality rate and tragic loss of loved ones to disease or accident in the prime of life, according to historians James and Dorothy Volo death became an accepted and inexorable fact of existence. As a whole, individuals found it easier to resign themselves to the reality of mortality, and doctors, who were already required to uphold an air of formality concerning their patients, were no different. Doctors undoubtedly practiced abortion in the antebellum South, but because it was a sensitive and often taboo subject, it is difficult to find example of it recorded. Some instances of abortion have been discovered among the records of slave women who were either unable to care for their children due to the harsh demands of their required work or whose children were often sold by avaricious masters. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, one woman was forced to watch as her master put all of her infant children up for sale, until, taking matters until her own hands, she decided that she was not going to let her master sell that baby. 'She got up and give it something out of a bottle and purty soon it was dead'. Says Fox-Genovese, these desperate women saw either terminating their pregnancies or killing their own children as a, ... way [to reclaim] it as their own. In a perverse way, infanticide could be seen as a means to give children life.

In an 1854 entry, Darden recounted a particularly unusual event: the exhumation of two corpses. Darden wrote that the remains of Rodney King and Mrs. Ogle were unearthed on February 23, 1854. She described the two as brother and sister, but gave no other details as to either their backgrounds or their personalities. The bodies were transported from the original gravesites in Tenesas Parish, Louisiana to Old Salem. How this was accomplished remained unstated, but Darden specifically mentioned that the two were reburied amongst their already-deceased relatives, including both their parents and brother. "," Southern burials and funerals have long been part of an evolving process, heavily influenced by the changing social conditions of the United States. According to scholar Charles Reagan Wilson, before the Civil War they shared many common characteristics with funerals in the North. Writes Wilson, southerners and northerners alike saw funerals as, a recognized time to overcome the separation [of a loved one]. In both the North and South funerals were cathartic ceremonies that allowed grieving friends and family the gift of closure. However, as the Civil War approached southerners began to isolate themselves within their own affinity group, and funerals became, true ceremonies of southern identity. Symbols of Dixie were prominently displayed, while eulogies explained the contribution of the deceased to the South as a region, Wilson writes. As it became more and more important for Southerners to maintain and uphold their distinctive 'southernness, it became equally as important for this identity to be displayed in all aspects of life, including death. "," The fact that the bodies Darden described were exhumed and moved to another burial site stresses the significance placed on burials in the South. Because southerners believed burial to be both an expression of southern pride and a means of closure, it was instrumentally important that the dead be given appropriate burial. Darden was vague about who ordered the corpses moved, but the person(s) clearly felt that King and Ogle's previous graves were unsuitable, possibly because mourners had not buried them among their family members. It is not surprising that if these two bodies had not been shown proper respect in death, those that loved them most would order them moved.

In October of 1879, Dr. Bryce, the superintendent, expanded his report, by including particular conditions and patient numbers, among other details. Averaging 400 patients, the hospital treated anything from pneumonia to cerebral softening to utter, indefinable insanity. The Hospital was neither gender nor racially divided. Of the 394 patients present in October of 1879, 208 were men, 186 women; 65 blacks and 329 whites. The Hospital received considerable amounts of state funding, nearly eighty-five thousand dollars in total. The funds were unrestricted and therefore used for anything from building improvements to employment benefits like free medication and services. The state not only offered funding but went so far as to appoint a special committee to examine causes of insanity, collect all pertinent information about practical ways to reform insane asylums and to ascertain details, expenses, etc. The committee's findings were positive. Officials called the care a labor of love for mankind. The committee also focused on defining particular deficiencies, namely, intemperance. Intemperance, deemed a disease by a panel of Alabama doctors, was said to have been acquired through multiple sources. Intemperance was most often contracted through habit and as the result of temptation put before the weak. The state of Alabama refused to take responsibility for those afflicted with intemperance. However, the committee returned suggesting that perhaps those infected with intemperance in the state of Alabama be secluded in a specific facility. The suggested facility would provide a place guarded from temptation and protected from danger. It would provide an environment to treat, cure and restore victims of intemperance to society. Interesting is that the symptoms of intemperance were never clearly outlined by the committee. Not to mention, the disease itself is found in no medical journals of the time. However, it is obvious through language analysis that intemperance is a condition of corruption which religious factions in Alabama sought to squash.  The question of intemperance is not nearly as alarming as the mention of the Insane Hospital in the first place. The disabled and disfigured were disregarded during the nineteenth century. People sequestered citizens with disabilities in insane asylums to distance themselves. That said, these asylums were rarely mentioned. The mere acknowledgment in the Montgomery Advertiser was a testament to the progressive nature of Alabama's social politics."],"display_date":"October 1, 1879","search_date":"1879-10-01","locations":[{"id":204,"lat":33.5726362717,"lng":-86.9006076776,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2463,"title":"Thanksgiving Day\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-11-06","end_date":"1886-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The November 6, 1886, edition of the <em>Goodson Gazette</em> of the Virginia Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind ran the announcement by President Grover Cleveland who declared Thursday, November 25 as a day of thanksgiving and prayer.

Two weeks later, the paper ran Governor Fitzhugh Lee's follow-up announcement that concurred with the President's request. Lee told the families in Virginia to render thanks to Almighty God. The paper dedicated two lines to the abundance of partridges, pheasants, and wild turkies in the markets. The paper of the 27th provided an analysis of the holiday and its effect on game. The article praised the idea of the holiday and its success, but it reminded the readers that the North initiated this custom and It is hard for an innovation to take root among the old established social customs of the South.... The article also promised that the holiday would not subtract from the Christmas holiday because people gave thanks for daily blessings at Thanksgiving and thanked God for the Saviour at Christmas. With that problem settled, the opposing page reminded readers that they killed many turkeys so that they could celebrate that day.

The American South explains that during Cleveland's presidency, his job included keeping the country united, especially because the Republicans and Democrats seemed to be at odds more so than normal. In addition, the pain of the Civil War remained strong in people's hearts. One way to unite everyone without politics was the reaffirmation of Thanksgiving Day's place in America. This way, the people could view Cleveland as a president who cared for his citizens and the union of the country. He also affirmed Christian ideas in the nation. He could try to win over votes by reinstituting a holiday that people enjoyed and boosting the economy through turkey sales.

Dr. Edson administered X-rays to Martin every day for a week as a treatment for blindness. He based his hypothesis on the improvement patients with atrophied muscles had when they received massages. Dr. Edson believed X-rays would accomplish the same for an atrophied optic nerve. Before the treatment, Martin could only discern the difference between night and day. By the end of the week, Martin could distinguish 'a sort of green', and Dr. Edson felt confident in his procedure."," There does not seem to be a follow up article to this one, so it is hard to know whether this treatment actually cured Martin or if the green he saw was simply a side effect from the X-rays penetrating his eyes. The article made no mention of the patient or doctor showing concern about the treatment, nor did it explain any safety measures Dr. Edson took. Augusta County's weekly, the <em>Staunton Spectator and Vindicator</em>, did not have much to report other than the above about an event as important as a blind person's increase in sight. Maybe the paper was reserving the celebration for more proof. "," The nineteenth century held the revolution of modern medicine in America and the world, according to Todd Timmons and W. F. Bynum. Discoveries occurred in germ theory, the importance of inoculation, and use of anesthesia for surgery. The founding of medical schools and the first health advisory board occurred. Most importantly for John Martin, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered x-rays in November 1895, only about a year before Dr. Edson used them to cure blindness. X-rays became widely popular very quickly for burning moles, treating acne and lupus vulgaris, and carcinomas in various organs. Extended exposure to x-rays left the skin browned and sometimes burned, only nurturing the developing idea that brown skin is healthier than white. Bynum does not cite the use of x-rays for eye problems, but Dr. Edson recognized the potential for x-rays for other health issues. Staunton was a small city with only 7,289 inhabitants in 1900, but within one of the most populous counties in Virginia. In 1886, one newspaper even ran an article boasting of the city's attributes: electricity, lights, telephones, music band, and opera house. Now, the city could boast that they had a doctor current to the science of the world because of their connections to other cities and states from the railroad that ran through it and telegraphs.

After attending the grand-opening, all the men and women of the city agreed that they had never seen their own theatre surpassed in beauty and style.  The curtain drapery over the hollow wooden windows and stage doors was fitted with precision, and the walls were no longer glum and drab but instead featured variegated colors trimmed in gold.  The Ladies' box had been completely remodeled for comfort as well as decorated with crimson, cushioned seats. The theatre was fit for royalty but available as a weekend diversion for the public.The man responsible for the theatre and its restoration was Mr. Preston, who had transformed the neglected building with thorough repairs and improvements.  There were new scenes and drop curtains painted by Mr. Vincent, and a new Stock Company was set to provide the best talent in the country to be featured regularly, along with a new band that was sure to impress.  Mr. Preston would stop at nothing to preserve the theatre, provide a safe environment, and also to ensure that Raleigh had the proper venues for leisure and courting.  Upon visiting the theatre, a reporter opined there is no greater asset to Raleigh, and no better reflection of the dignified and cultured population that calls our marvelous city home.This narrative focuses on the influx of culture and opportunities to the South; attempts to rival those of the North.  This can also be seen as an effort to equalize rural an urban by fostering greater education and confidence for Southern farmers who felt inferior to the increasing civilization of urban areas.  However on a local level, this was clearly a venue for class division to be recognized, thus resulting in greater oppression of poor whites who could not afford leisure activities and blacks, who never dreamed of attending such events.  Bringing a theater to the South was also in accordance with unforeseen surpluses of time that had been unavailable in earlier decades when both men and women worked daylight to dawn.  The institution of slavery allowed blacks to handle duties in and around the home, while also watching over a master's house. This freed the master and his wife, or a young suitor and his date, to go out on the town on evenings.

In his report, Burnett noted the improvements that an efficient water system could have in the community. The townspeople of Norfolk would benefit in many aspects of life- domestic use, manufactures, extinguishment of fires, shipping, public baths, public fountains, street cleaning, and sewage. Burnett stressed the health and safety benefits of the new water system, as an abundant supply of clean water would not only aid in the prevention of fires, but also dramatically improve the overall health of the city and its citizens. Burnett divided his plan into five categories: the Receiving Reservoir, the Engines and Engine house, the Distributing Reservoir, the Principal Main, and Distribution. The town would use the dam at Deep Creek as their water supply, the same source that the Dismal Swamp Canal Company used. Next, Norfolk's government needed to buy a new pumping engine for fire prevention. Burnett advised that the town buy two or three Worthington Patent Engines, as it was the same model that the city of Savannah used. The Distributing Reservoir would be an iron tank with the ability to hold 250 thousand gallons of water. Burnett suggested that the Principal Main Line run from the Engine House into Main Street, and be linked to 125 fire hydrants. Burnett estimated that the city could finish this extensive 364 thousand dollar project in a year."," Burnett's proposal represented an effort for civic improvement that was characteristic of many cities in the South during the mid-nineteenth century. As Southern economic hubs, such as Norfolk, looked to increase their economic output, local governments began to focus on improving the urban environment of their cities. City officials wanted their communities to appeal to prospective business partners. With epidemic being closely related to a city's cleanliness, people looking to trade avoided cities that had a fertile environment for disease. If disease broke out, such as Norfolk's yellow fever epidemic just two years earlier, the flow of goods and agriculture would stop. Therefore, cities in the South created subsidiaries for the improvement of roads, fire protection, lighting, and water supply in order to prevent an outbreak of disease. It is important to note that these measures were mostly run for the economic interests of the businessmen and city officials, not for the health and well being of the people. Though the community definitely benefited from these improvements, the true purpose, driven by powerful business leaders, was to give their city better economic opportunity.

A yellow fever epidemic that spread throughout Eastern Virginia's Tidewater Region during 1855 did just that. Laura Reed, a resident of Portsmouth, Virginia, recounted the state of the town during the epidemic to her sister, Ellen Reed of Hampton, Virginia, in a letter on September 1, 1855. Laura described the damage to the community's population as severe, though the local physicians believed that the epidemic would be over soon. The doctors' opinion was that the epidemic would begin to decline after sixty days of exposure in the community. Since the fever had reached Portsmouth about a week after the Fourth of July, the town was optimistic for a return to good health. Laura noted that there had been a steady decrease in the amount of deaths last night, as only nine people had perished. Though Laura's immediate neighbors were now beginning to show an early sign of the fever, the black vomit, she reiterated to Ellen that she felt quite safe. Laura and her mother, with whom she lived with in Portsmouth, kept the house well ventilated and fumigated with chloride of lime and guano, safety measures that had been working well to ward off the fever. Though Laura and her mother may have avoided an infection, the yellow fever had severely crippled Portsmouth and the surrounding region.","Epidemics ravaged the Southern states during the mid-nineteenth century. The hot, humid summers that were characteristic of the South provided the perfect environment for the contraction and spread of infectious disease. Unfortunately, most Southern cities lacked the proper safety precautions and policies to effectively prevent and contain these deadly epidemics. The reason for this lack of preparation was economic. Since businessmen often ran most communities and cities during the time, they were hesitant to spend their money on costly town improvements. Officials believed the improvements were not worth the money that they cost. Though the need for these safety measures was quite obvious, funding for such projects was usually inadequate.","The economic effects of this yellow fever epidemic were catastrophic on the Tidewater economy, especially in the area's economic hub, Norfolk. The fear that the yellow fever caused was significant. This fear was warranted, as ten percent of the Norfolk population would be killed from the yellow fever. Due to the epidemic, Baltimore, New York, and the cities of Virginia placed a four month trade interdict on goods from Norfolk, a ban that deprived the Norfolk economy of an estimated five million dollars in trade profits. This paranoia effected more than just the economy, as many frightened Virginians rallied to get the state legislature in Richmond moved to a safer location. The city of Norfolk, and all of the surrounding Tidewater communities that depended on it, would need about five years to recover from their damaged economy and image."],"display_date":"September 1, 1855 - December 31, 1860","search_date":"1858-05-02","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2489,"title":"Murder in Portsmouth, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1855-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On October 14, 1854, a neighbor found the Braden family of Portsmouth, Virginia dead in their home. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was excessive amounts of laudanum in their stomachs. The town was outraged and astonished. Who would commit such a heinous crime? The members of the community greatly respected the Braden family, and mourned their loss. A carpenter who was in the house that morning remembered seeing a seamstress, Mrs. Gray, preparing coffee for the family. After the carpenter left the house, he saw Mrs. Gray hurriedly walking down the street. Later that day, the neighbor found the bodies. The town formed search parties, and soon they found a frail, terrified woman in the woods surrounding town. Portsmouth had found its murderer.","Mrs. Gray was actually Maria Black Thorn, a woman who led a very troubled past. Maria was traveling on a boat to New York City when it stopped for repairs in Portsmouth. In ill health and lacking money, Thorn stayed in Portsmouth, and found a job working for the Braden family. During the trial, Thorn revealed that the Bradens' deaths had been unintentional. The night before the family was found dead, she had stolen 500 dollars from the house. With this money, Thorn intended to leave Portsmouth and make her way to New York City. Thorn deposited laudanum in the coffee to put the family to sleep during her getaway, not kill them. Nonetheless, the jury of Portsmouth sentenced Thorn to death. Thorn became very ill after the trial, and stayed in her prison cell for months awaiting her execution. The town never received a chance to hang Maria Black Thorn though, as a guard found her dead in her prison cell on March 20, 1855. She had committed suicide.","Bizarre murders like the Thorn case rattled the security of a community. The fear and confusion that arose left the town in an unsettled state. People grew suspicious of each other, and the citizens lost their mutual trust. Thorn's trial reveals the necessary actions taken by a local court to stabilize the community after such an event. Ill and poor, Thorn had no intentions of murdering the family. Nonetheless, the court gave the only sentence that could possibly compensate for the death of Portsmouth citizens-death. Though Thorn was a woman, she was an outsider to the community, and the court's objective was to restore peace and trust within the town. Therefore, no lenience was shown. ","The Thorn case correlates to a situation that Rothman examines in Notorious in the Neighborhood. In the case of Peggy, a sexually abused slave who was an accomplice in her master's murder, similarities arise between the two situations. Constantly raped by her master, Peggy lived a harsh life, and probably deserved to murder her master. However, the testimonies of the involved slaves leave uncertainty surrounding Peggy's role in the murder. Similar to the Thorn case, doubt surrounds the motive of the murder, and the woman's lifestyle is almost unbearable. After her sentencing, many citizens petitioned for her acquittal, citing her living condition and uncertain role in her master's death. Nonetheless, the court of New Kent County, Virginia hung Peggy to restore harmony to the town. Both cases reveal a local court's social duty to re-establish order in the community. In tight-knit communities, it was the court's role to maintain justice and stability within society. Violent acts of crime weakened people's feeling of security, and increased their suspicions of outsiders. In Thorn's case, the people of Portsmouth were more fearful of outsiders to their community; in Peggy's, her master's murder brought slave owners' fears of slave retaliation to reality. Citizens had sympathy for both women, but the death sentence was the only option-lenience was not. Though the accused were both women, the community took precedence. In order to uphold the safety and security of the society, both courts took the necessary action by issuing death sentences to the women.

Though Little Caroline [was] accused of pilfering money from members of the Blackford family, the change was never proven, and Mr. Blackford still looked after the health of his slaves.  Mr Blackford showered his slaves with special favors. John Blackford owned Ferry Hill Plantation in Maryland from 1816-1840.  In 1838, he owned twenty-five slaves and employed, forty-one other workers.  As a slave owner he seldom complained about their work; there is only one recorded criticism of his slave workers. While he did punish his bondsmen, it was a rare occasion and came only after he felt it was deserved.  Careless or deliberate destruction of property he would not tolerate.  This carelessness resulted in a few lashes, but it did not occur often.  Blackford hardly ever supervised his slaves, and was considered a considerate master. Though Blackford treated his slaves relatively well, this was not the norm for the majority of slaveholders in Maryland at the time.  Slaves were not considered humans as evidenced by Maryland's passing of the Fugitive Slave Laws in this same year, 1839.  Though Blackford was a humane plantation owner and slaveholder; others in the South treated their slaves vastly different. Walter Johnson's, <em>Soul by Soul</em>, describes slaves' constant fear of being sold further south because of the reputation slaveholders had in the Deep South.

For the first time in ten years the hopeless invalid, Peter Smith regained mobility and began to enjoy life once more.  Cancer-free after years battling the disease, Mrs. Henry Synder experienced a full recovery.  On May 1, 1885, the <em>New York Times </em>detailed the mysterious faith cures in Birmingham with the stories of Mrs. Phillips, Mr. Smith, and Mrs. Synder.  According to the New York Times, faith healing comprised a new religion in Birmingham. While the followers drew from all Christian denominations, the majority came from the Methodist Episcopal Church.  Although religious in foundation, faith healing took on a systematic, not spiritual approach in curing various diseases.  J.E. Brierley, a local merchant, and spokesman for the Birmingham faith healers stressed to the <em>New York Times </em>that the practice involved a precise methodology.  Additionally, Brierley noted, medicines have no place in the scheme of faith healers in Birmingham.  Drugs only retard recovery from a disease and were in no cases to be used.  "," The Birmingham faith healers were an example of a growing religious movement in the South.  The Holiness movement appeared in the South during the last two decades of the nineteenth century and grew largely, though not exclusively from the Methodist church.  According to Richard T. Hughes, the Holiness church appealed to poor and disinherited southerners and emphasized physical healing.  Despite Birmingham's unrivaled iron industry and overall economic prosperity, many citizens struggled to make ends meet.  The Holiness movement spoke to these residents and found a band of faithful followers in Birmingham.  ","With an emphasis on faith healing, the Holiness movement flourished in the 1880s and into the 1890s. Many southern evangelists preached the doctrine of healing and printed accompanying testimonies.  Two southern ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church, R.C. Oliver and L.M. Pike, compiled one such publication, The Way of Faith.  Additionally, leaders of various Christian movements traveled throughout the South at the end of the nineteenth century preaching faith healing to large audiences.  As leader of the New Testament Church of Christ, Mary Lee Wasson Harris Cagle traveled throughout the South preaching from north Alabama to Texas.  Maria Woodworth-Etter toured the South in the 1890s as well, attributing the miraculous cures of healers to the powers God.  While faith healers traveled throughout the South, news of their miraculous work spread throughout the North.

Blue was a man of a large family and was generally understood to be of a high moral character.  Ultimately, Blue took the matter into his own hands and his suicide cast a gloom over the city.  ","    Southern states first introduced divorce legislation at the end of the eighteenth century and the first general divorce law in the South was passed down by the Maryland Legislature in 1839.  According to Alabama law detailed in History of Alabama, divorces were allowed in various cases including adultery, impotency, drunkenness, and imprisonment.  Mr. Kelley would have thus been granted a legal divorce on the grounds of infidelity.  In describing the history of divorce in the South, N.E.H. Hull observes, Divorce remained relatively uncommon in the pre-Civil War era, though the rate steadily increased and would continue to increase throughout the next century and a half.  The divorce law in Alabama became more flexible as a result of the increasing prevalence of southern divorce.  As documented in History of Alabama, divorces were subsequently granted if it were proved that the other had been guilty of...violating tombs, stealing from a church, cattle stealing... or other various offenses.  As divorce became less taboo and more readily available in Alabama by the end of the nineteenth century, Blue would not have felt excessive societal guilt over his role in the Kelley divorce.  Why then his suicide?  According to the History of Alabama, divorces were not granted in the state: if adultery was committed by either in order to obtain a divorce.  Perhaps Blue had secretly wished to divorce his wife and start a new life with the former Mrs. Kelley.  If the state deemed his adultery deliberate, Blue would not be granted a divorce, which perhaps proved too much to bear for the physician.     ","    While Blue's suicide can be viewed through the lens of southern divorce practices, the episode also provides and opportunity to explore family values throughout the South at the end of the nineteenth century.  Social historian Carl N. Degler characterizes the South as a place where roots, place, family, and tradition are the essence of identity.  Indeed family was an extremely valuable aspect of identity for most southerners.  Families wealthy enough in the late 1800s and early 1900s commissioned large family portraits while poorer southern families depended on traveling photographers to capture their family's likeness.  Southern social life was so family-centric that historians have likened southern family solidarity to that of a clan.  Blue's suicide can be interpreted according to southern family values at the end of the nineteenth century.  While divorce was legally an option for Mr. Kelley and his wife, the resulting break in Blue's family may not have been an option for the physician."],"display_date":"September 4, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-04","locations":[{"id":304,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2538,"title":"Freedom of the Black Press?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-20","end_date":"1889-08-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was just another days' work for two employees of the Alabama Great Southern train company.  On the evening of August 27, 1889, the trainmen pulled into the Birmingham station and prepared to disembark.  Upon exiting the train, the workers spotted two black men swinging from trees in the near distance.  According to sources at <em>The Washington Post,</em> the lynched men were the incendiary editors of the black newspaper, the Independent.  The editors were allegedly run out of Selma, Alabama the preceding week and supposed to have been lynched in Birmingham.  <em>The Post </em>noted, It is impossible to get particulars.  ","<em>The Post's</em> report incidentally concluded the dramatic Selma controversy first exposed in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> on August 20, 1889.  The article, Alabama's War of Races, shed light on the racial tensions that plagued Selma.  On August 19, Reverend Edward Bryant, associate editor to the Independent wrote a highly controversial editorial attacking the whites of Selma and the larger southern community.   In his charged conclusion Bryant projected, You have had your revolutionary and civil wars and we here predict that at no distant day we will have our race war, and we hope, as God intends, that we will be strong enough to wipe you out of existence and hardly leave enough of you to tell the story.  According to the Tribune, Selma mayor, E. Starr publicly condemned the revolutionary nature of Byrant's editorial.  Both sides built up arms in the likely event of a violent outbreak.  Mayor Starr held the pledge of Confederate veterans to fight on behalf of the uniformly armed white population of Selma.  Bloodshed and conflict appeared almost unavoidable.   ","Racial tensions and violence plague the history of Alabama.  According to historian Virginia Hamilton, the use of violence was originally disconnected from racial issues, oftentimes settling disputes between whites settlers.  However, the tradition of violence in Alabama eventually shifted towards African Americans in the years following the Civil War.  Hamilton writes, Violence, the hasty recourse for settling scores between white men in frontier Alabama, was focused upon blacks after emancipation and war had proclaimed them to be people instead of property.  Initially the fear of a black uprising involving armed and newly freed slaves drove groups such as the Ku Klux Klan to persecute and execute countless African Americans in Alabama.  Towards the end of the century, however, statewide politics influenced many lynchings across the state.  One such example was the infamous 1882 lynching of black Republican leader, Jack Turner.  When Turner's Choctow County voted Republican in the 1882 gubernatorial election, the Democrats panicked.  With an upcoming congressional election the Democrats could not risk losing political power to the Republicans; Turner was shortly after found hanging from an oak tree.  ","    <em>The Post's</em> report of the lynching fits into the larger story of southern lynching in the post-slavery era.  A vague allegation of criminality motivated lynchings throughout the South.  There was an average of 150.4 lynchings per year during the last 19 years of the nineteenth century (1882-1900).  These lynched victims were usually accused of raping white women or other trivial crimes.  The murder of the two Independent editors does not fit into the general theme of crime retaliation seeing as the only crime committed was in their exercise of freedom of speech.  However, the story of Rev. Bryant and his associate editor at the Independent portrays the lingering fear of a black revolution.  The perpetual threat of black retaliation for slavery remained imminent in the minds of southern whites and the lynching of Bryant exemplified this fear.

Would the Chicago news reach her parents back home in Tuscumbia before she made it home to tell them in person? On May 17, 1890, the Chicago Tribune ran a special on the miraculous case of Helen Keller; a blind, deaf and dumb child from Alabama. Keller's wealthy parents had sent her up north to a special institution for the blind. According to the article, Keller's parents had heard of the great progress made by another student, Laura Bridgman, and hoped for the same results for Helen. Her success however, far exceeded that of Ms. Bridgman and in the first year Helen acquired a vocabulary of 3,000 words. Her teacher, Miss Fuller, gave her instruction as to how to place her tongue and the child would feel of her teacher's throat and lips when she was talking, thus learning the mechanical elements of articulation. The Tribune reported that Helen subsequently spoke quite readily and praised her remarkable accomplishments. After announcing Helen's feat to the entire city of Chicago, the Tribune concluded, The child has kept her wonderful recovery of speech secret, as she wishes to surprise her parents, whom she is to visit in the South soon. "," Born a healthy baby in Tuscumbia on June 27, 1880, a fever rendered Keller deaf and blind at the age of eighteen months old. Despite all odds, Helen Keller had achieved an international reputation even before studying under Sarah Fuller in 1890. By 1888, at the tender age of eight, Keller was recognized in the Chicago Tribune for her wonderful power. The article spoke of Helen's education in Tuscumbia with Miss Anne Mausfueld Sullivan. At the age of seven, Helen's parents hired Miss Sullivan to teach the child in Alabama. Subsequently, Helen traveled north to continue her education with another teacher, Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School. Helen Keller's story became a widely recognized and heartwarming tale by the turn of the century and her dedication to learning earned her both a spot in the public eye and that of history. "," Helen Keller's first educational breakthrough occured at home in Tuscumbia. Why then would her parents then send her away from Alabama to continue her learning? The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind was established in the 1860s and served as a special needs school close to home. And yet, Keller traveled north to further her education at various private institutions including the prestigious Horace Mann School. Though Keller proved an exceptional case with respect to her achievements in education, she was not alone in her journey north to further her schooling. Many wealthy Alabama natives sent their children north at the end of the nineteenth century in search of higher education. The ill-defined school system and educational deficiencies throughout Alabama led many to look outside the state for higher educational purposes. Furthermore, racial segregation throughout the South created similar education problems as those faced in Alabama. State biographer William Rogers observes, In Alabama, as in the rest of the South, the problems of educational support were compounded by the decision to establish parallel institutions for whites and blacks. Due to racial tensions throughout the South, many southern families turned north for the best educational opportunities. If families had the private funds to find the best education available, many southerners looked north during times of educational and racial turmoil in the South.

The slave did not deny his crime and appeared to show no remorse at the time of his execution. The only excuse offered by Dave for this gruesome act was that he had been drinking before the time the act was committed. Those who were there to witness his hanging claimed that his demeanor was indifferent towards his fate, and that he even dared to smile at times. Between the daytime hours of twelve and two, Dave was publicly hung by the town sheriff. The body dangled for thirty minutes before it was cut down and buried. Upon his burial, many physicians from neighboring towns rushed to his grave site to be the first to claim the body for dissection. ","We do not know anything of the events that induced Dave to murder his master. Since Dave offered no excuse for his crime, one can only speculate upon his possible stimulus. Dave could have murdered him for any number of reasons. A sexual advance on a loved one by his owner, persuasion by another white man, or any other perceived injustice brought upon him could have provoked Dave to commit this deed. ","However valid the crime's impetus, the murder of a white man at the hands of a slave or person of color was considered a serious offense punishable by death. Historian Joshua Rothman argues that although most African Americans who murdered their masters were sentenced to hang, many were not forced to endure this harsh sentence due to the intervention of other whites in the town who could vouch for the particular slave's character. In the instance of Dave, however, this intervention did not occur. From the tone of the article announcing the hanging, Dave showed no remorse for what he had done. His indifferent attitude, the lack of significant reason for the crime he committed, and the apparent lack of respect received from the members of the white community most likely did not lend itself to an appeal for a more lenient sentence."],"display_date":"November 17, 1848","search_date":"1848-11-17","locations":[{"id":12441,"lat":36.2251619225,"lng":-82.4967689306,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2577,"title":"The Elite South are Immune\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-09-07","end_date":"1832-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A cholera epidemic struck the United States in 1834, affecting southerners in every social standing. However; elitism and negative racial attitudes ultimately influenced perceptions about the transmission of the disease. Todd Savitt, a historian specializing in nineteenth-century medicine and disease stated that white Virginians often related high morals, clean living and orthodoxy to immunity during the cholera epidemics. White paupers, free blacks, and slaves because of their sinful ways, degraded condition, and filthy habits were viewed as the prime targets for cholera. Whites, who may have revealed symptoms of Cholera, were often diagnosed with diarrhea, dysentery, or fever rather than to be diagnosed with the poor man's disease. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported the first case of malignant cholera in Richmond, it was not surprising to Virginians that the first victim was a slave boy. The master of the young boy wrote an urgent letter to the Richmond Department of Health describing symptoms of cholera and the condition of his dying slave. The young boy, an eleven year old subject to fits of diarrhea and incredibly dehydrated died a few hours later in the tobacco factory of his master. The young boy exhibited the principle symptoms of cholera: bouts of profuse diarrhea. The Richmond Board of Health traced the cause of cholera to the young boy's consumption of contaminated pears. The Richmond Board of Health would later publish statements connecting the supposedly crude eating habits of the underclass to cholera. "," Location rather than race and class attributed to the prevalence of cholera among free blacks, slaves, and lower class whites. According to Dhiman Barua and William Greenough, medical professors specializing in cholera epidemics, the cholera bacterium thrives in water ecosystems and transmits through the ingestion of water or food contaminated by fecal mater. Those living close to cities express high rates of vulnerability to the disease.  Transmission rates of cholera in the nineteenth-century South rose because of unsanitary conditions in newly developing cities. In Richmond, the James River and the Kanawha Canal provided opportunities for cholera to spread through low income homes and slave quarters. Free blacks, urban slaves and lower class whites throughout the South faced increased susceptibility to cholera that was attributed to densely populated housing, inefficient waste management systems and close proximity to local rivers, rather than race and class."],"display_date":"September 7, 1832","search_date":"1832-09-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2583,"title":"The Gruesome History of a Wartime Steamboat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1864-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The Civil War diary of John L.

Though this was common for wars before the twentieth century, the sheer number of sick soldiers bears some relation to the diseases prevalent in the South.

From the bluff she could see freedmen sharecropping cotton for a wealthy doctor who lived in the area. Even though the blacks were desperately poor, she noticed that they were  so happy and satisfied with their condition. Many of them were one mass of rags, others are covered with a collection of patches which make them look like a traveling bed of quilts.  Although it was unclear from the article, the woman was likely part of a northern missionary group.   She focused on their peculiar religious practices rooted in African traditions.

The encounter made the woman made her appreciate the privilege of living in a Christian land. ","Northern missionaries encountered an illiterate and impoverished population of freed blacks in Tennessee that were very happy to be free despite their desperate conditions.  After the defeat of the Confederacy, religious scholars argued that God had delivered the slaves from physical and spiritual bondage.  Both white and black missionaries from the North came to the aid of freedmen who used religion to seek a better education.   Groups such as the American Missionary Association and the American Freedmen's Union Commission taught African Americans to read and write through Bible study.  They educated new black ministers to educate the freedmen so that they could move beyond the cycle of sharecropping and tenant farming.  This was a crucial development for freedmen plagued by tuberculosis and sharecropping agreements that made freed slaves dependent on their former masters.   For missionaries who lived a privileged life in the North, it was hard to believe freedom under harsh conditions was an improvement from a lifetime of slavery. ","Northern missionaries who came to the South in large numbers after the Civil War attempted to civilize African Americans by teaching them Christianity, but blacks adopted Christianity into their preexisting African religions.  Historians had to revise their earlier theory that generations of slavery removed African culture from African Americans.  The woman's account showed that African culture  still thrived in 1870.  Religious scholars have noted that once African Americans read the Bible, they easily adapted to the Evangelical Christian experience because it related to possession by spirits in many African religious traditions.   Most southern churches believed that the African American version of Christianity that was deeply rooted African religion was hethenistic  and barbaric.  Evangelical Christians, on the other hand, welcomed African Americans to experience conversion in an unorthodox way and did not chastise black converts the way other Christians did."],"display_date":"February 24, 1870 - February 28, 1870","search_date":"1870-02-26","locations":[{"id":11940,"lat":35.4928224111,"lng":-86.0722573506,"zoom":9,"place":"COFFEE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2602,"title":"Prisoners of War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-10-25","end_date":"1864-10-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Prisoners of war often suffered the worstamong soldiers who fought in the Civil War. Eugene Davis was one such prisoner of war at Elmira Military Prison in 1864. The two most infamous Civil War prisons opened that year in Andersonville, Georgiaand at Elmira, New York. After he arrived in Elmira, Davis wrote to his family in Albemarle County, who promptly wrote him back. He received letters from three different relatives in one day. Davis explained that he lived in a building with 150 other Confederates. He had a cold before he wrote the letter, but recovered from it. Davis also mentioned both the number of times per day guards fed prisoners at Elmira and how the entire camp went to the same building to procure rations every day. Eugene Davis expressed great confidence that he would survive the prison camp, and hoped for more letters from his family. ","Prisoners of war suffered enormously in 1864 and 1865 in both the Union and the Confederacy. Union soldiers in Andersonville Prison suffered from exposure because of lack of shelter, dysentery and diarrhea due to poor diet, and sometimes death because of the lack of medical care. The Confederacy suffered in large measure because of the lack of a clear chain of command over the Confederate prison system in general, and inefficient command structure at Andersonville. Georgia officials made matters worse by repeatedly refusing to cooperate in the supply of lumber, regular guards, slave labor, cattle drivers, and tents to the prison. Andersonville had an intended capacity of 10,000. By May 1864, it was 50 percent over capacity. By mid June the prison contained 24,000 Union prisoners. In a pattern to be repeated in both Union and Confederate prisons, as the prison population grew, food and other supplies did not keep up and deteriorated to extremes. In addition the Confederate government gradually became totally negligent towards the prisoners at Andersonville, while more than willing to continue to send prisoners there over the protests of the administrators of the camp. Henry Wirz and John H. Winder, two of the officers in charge, could not keep up with the tide of incoming Union prisoners during the summer of 1864. The situation at Andersonville reached a tipping point on July 25 1864 when more than 30,000 prisoners were present at the camp with no rations to feed them. Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon and others only changed the situation when Sherman's Union armies drew close to Andersonville that fall. Ten thousand of the Andersonville prisoners were shipped to Salisbury, North Carolina by October 1864. Just four months later, due to further Confederate neglect, 34 percent of these men had died. ","Confederate prisoners of war at Elmira suffered many of the same troubles as Andersonville prisoners. Despite the economic advantages of the Union over the Confederacy, lack of food in sufficient quality and quantity to keep prisoners healthy was a problem. This suggests that like in the Confederacy, maltreatment of prisoners was not a result of inability to help them but of unwillingness by individuals in the Union prison system. As at Andersonville, as the prisoner population of Elmira increased, the food problem worsened. Eugene Davis wrote in his letter of the many thousands of men in Elmira who all had to use the same cook-house. Scurvy emerged due to poor diet, just as at Confederate prison camps. Both Elmira and Andersonville had no hospital to care for the sick for much of their operation. Andersonville was closed in the early fall of 1864, but Elmira remained open, and bore witness to even greater suffering by prisoners in 1865. A new enemy attacked Confederate prisoners in Elmira in the winter of 1864-1865, New York's cold weather. Confederates found it especially difficult to deal with because stoves were scarce. In February 1865, 426 Confederates died at Elmira about a third of all the sick. Though Andersonville may be more famous as a place of misery for prisoners of war, Elmira actually had a higher mortality rate, 24 percent, or 3,000 out of 12,000 total prisoners. Eugene Davis' letter to his daughter is very significant to understanding the lives of prisoners of war. He wrote of the hardships of camp life, of his desire to hear from his family, and his yearning to think of his home, not his prison. The suffering and uncertainty felt by Eugene Davis' family while he was a prisoner of war repeated itself in counties all over Virginia and all over the South, as Confederate soldiers tried to survive the war in prisoner of war camps.

During the antebellum period, the practices of medical doctors were not always well regulated. Doctors were considered quite knowledgeable but most of their remedies were local in nature and chosen over pharmaceuticals. Steven Stowe, author of Doctoring the South, portrays southern medicine as a mixture of medical school background, country or conventional orthodoxy, personal experience, and even folk cures. The Encyclopedia of the Antebellum South reports that the medicines often prescribed were just as likely to kill as they were to cure the patient; they were often ineffective and allowed the illness to progress for too long before alternative procedures were started. Therefore, much of the development of medicines were not in a lab at a medical school, but rather by the trial and error of educated men on their own time."," Authenticity was a concern for newly developed medicines. Druggists and all other dealers of medications were allowed to sell Cephalic Pills but only the genuine product has the signature of its creator. Not only was the authenticity of the drug an issue, but also the advertisement's claims as to its effects. An ad in the Richmond Daily Examiner in August of 1861 promoted cephalic pills to cure sick headache, nervous headache- even all kinds of headache They are made entirely of vegetable extracts and the ad claims these pills to be the result of much research and experimentation. This ad, like many others of its kind, primarily targeted literary men, students, delicate females, and all persons of sedimentary habits. These pills were said to double as a laxative, restoring the natural elasticity and strength of the whole system. "," The scientific basis for the development of these pills was not yet advanced. Pharmacology in general was still in the early stages of development. Pills were considered more proper than potions, for relief of the head because they remained in the stomach longer before they were able to dissolve. They are also not considered weak or strong and therefore are very agreeable to the digestive system. The basic fundamentals of chemistry were not even solid at this point. It was not until 1897 that JJ Thomson discovered the subatomic particle known as an electron Medicine had just now begun to evolve towards more modern and scientifically based techniques."," The second half of the nineteenth century was a groundbreaking time for biomedical science. The development of germ theory and establishment of fields such as pharmacology paved the way for significant advances in medicine and pharmacology. There was no laboratory instruction for students of pharmacology before the Civil War, and it was not until some pharmacy schools became state supported in the 1860s, that science held an integral role in pharmacology.

The Governor appointed him Colonel of the Virginia Volunteers; he was honored to hold such an independent position but warned Mary Anna, whom he affectionately called little one, that they would probably not be able to correspond for quite some time. By his faith in God, he asked her not to worry, that he would be protected until he could meet with her again. "," The Civil War certainly took its toll on every family during the war. Four out of every five southern men left their homes and family to fight for the Confederate cause. Families were torn apart and more often than not, because of death, not able to be put back together. "," Most Confederate men joined the army to protect their lifestyles - their families and their land. They wanted to protect their liberty and their homes from attack. However, as the war progressed, many men felt that they would be almost better served at their homes, protecting one piece at a time. By 1864, Union armies occupied every Southern state and they began taking over. Desertion by Confederate soldiers resulted because they feared so much for their family's safety. In William Cooper's The American South, he quotes a desperate wife's forceful case saying there is no use in keeping a man thare to kill him and leave widows and poore little orphen children to suffer... My poor children have no home nor no Father. Many men, while dedicated to the cause, still abandoned their ranks. Their duty was most importantly to the families they were fighting to protect. "," By the last winter of the war, thousands of soldiers had disappeared. Men such as Thomas Jackson remained dedicated to his service. He remained faithful to his Virginia Volunteers and said farewell to his wife for quite some time. As the war progressed morale decreased and the South could see their grips loosening and therefore, soldiers were not always as reliable."," Because so many Southern men left home to fight in the war, women were forced to become more self-sufficient and independent. They took on the duties their husbands and fathers once held. They managed farms and worked in factories. While this was a new opportunity for women, they were more concerned with surviving and their husbands returning home. When the war was over and the men returned, most women resumed their previous lifestyles, thankful that normalcy was beginning to return. "," Mary Anna had no assurance that she would ever see her husband again. Most women of the South did not. All they could do was have a little faith, stay busy, and pray for their men to come home.

The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

On January 11, 1868, HarpWeek published a two-picture political cartoon entitled The Pleasure of Tobacco. The first picture featured a young man in bed enjoying his pipe. The caption under the drawing said, To which young and promising Tom Smudger abandons himself. He wasteth the midnight oil. Quantities of Killikinick, and himself simultaneously. However, the second picture is a casket covered in a sheet with a pipe on top. The casket is resting in the grass of the graveyard; captioned Smudge becomes a martyr to his Love, and the Object of the Devotion is buried with him. This cartoon warned against the fatal consequences of smoking tobacco. "," George William Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly, used to smoke himself but stopped in the 50s. In 1867, he submitted his own editorial to warn his readers of the negative effects of tobacco use on their health. He said that tobacco contained poisons that were harmful to our bodies and that if we quit, we will soon feel in better health. The deadly politics of tobacco was certainly a struggle- on one hand it was the second most profitable cash crop in the South, but on the other, people were dying from it as well. "," HarpWeek published many advertisements for tobacco products as well as those for quit and get fit campaigns. But in the man while people die prematurely of palsy of the heart, cancerous stomachs, and diseased lungs from its excessive use; and they will continue to do so if half the world is depopulated by this vegetable tyrant. Lack of scientific evidence regarding tobacco's harmful effects caused much controversy over the topic. Some claimed that everything in moderation was fine, including tobacco use and that it in no way could be linked to disease. "," Even the last great tax on the luxury of cigars and pigtail, by Congress, which seemed likely to limit its consumption, has had no more effect than beating an elephant with a feather. Efforts were made by governments across the country to tax tobacco more heavily in hopes to reduce its widespread usage; however, it's use continued to only expand. Some saw tobacco as a drug, a killer, and others as just something to do to pass the time. Even a hundred years before Surgeon General warnings, we already had begun to understand tobacco's effects. "," Tobacco was more prevalently grown during the colonial period, than during the years after the Civil War, but it certainly had not disappeared from the scene. Seventy-five percent of cotton came from plantations along with other crops such as sugar, rice and tobacco. Richmond was one of the largest producers of tobacco in the world during this time. The slave trade experienced increased activity and more profitability than any other time thus far and therefore provided even more labor for fieldwork. The new railroads connecting the rest of the country also allowed tobacco to be traded and sold great distances. Tobacco remained a very important cash crop in North Carolina and Kentucky. Meanwhile plantations in Virginia and Maryland were not so fortunate; they suffered from depleted soil and decreasing profits. "," Tobacco was an extremely soil depleting crop. While plantations thrived, small farmers were hard pressed for money for such large-scale productions. They would often plant small plots of lower quality tobacco and rotate with other crops like sweet potatoes and cowpeas to allow the soils to recoup. These small farmers rarely could afford to own slaves because prices had sky rocketed in upwards of 2,000 a slave. In order for plantations to succeed, planters not only had to have plenty of acreage but enough cheap labor to work it. Needless to say, the plantation economy was not the norm for most southern whites but was responsible for the production of the majority of tobacco for the entire nation. "," The years preceding the war, cigarettes became the most popular form of tobacco- both hand rolled and machine rolled. The tobacco industry continued to boom from Virginia all the way down to Georgia. Durham and Winston-Salem North Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky, and Richmond, Virginia became major centers for cigarette production and brought wealth to the areas. The invention of the cigarette rolling-machine and the manufacture of cigarettes so close to home increased the demand for the plant immensely. Annual national per capita consumption rose from 1.5 pounds in 1860 to 5.5 pounds in 1900, a 267 percent rise. "," Tobacco never lost its place in society nor the economy as both a source of pleasure and of pain. Even a hundred years later, we are still battling its cancerous effects on our nation.

This license enabled Mr. Austin to distill from domestic materials for one week only. The rules set forth by this license were issued by the United States, not the state of Virginia. Mr. Austin's license shows how alcohol was an important part of the social scene of the South. According to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the South has always been into heavy drinking, even when Virginia was only a colony, and the colonists heavily on many occasions. Southerners were also known for the variety of drinks that they consumed. Wilson and Ferris explain that brandies were made from apples, peaches, pears, and other local fruit...imported wines/ graced wealthy tables... (and) All classes drank rum, which was obtained in exchange for southern commodities. After the Revolution, molasses became expensive, and whiskey became the major drink of the South."," The Upper South, including Buckingham County, became a region for distilling bourbon which was distilled from corn, a crop which grew well in this region. Whiskey stayed as the prominent drink of the South until the mid twentieth century. Many settlers illegally distilled alcohol on the frontier of the South. Because alcohol was a large part of life in the South, the residents experienced both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, alcohol became the social beverage to most in the South. Whether it was beer at a small farmer's get together or wine at a wealthy planter's dinner party, alcohol became the drink of the social scene in the antebellum South. On the negative side, alcohol brought about widespread alcoholism and violence. "," The negative effects of widespread alcohol use became the main motives for the temperance movements throughout the nineteenth century. The temperance movement took a while to gain a hold in the South, but the religious revivals helped this movement gain momentum. Some townspeople supported this movement, included those strongly influenced by the religious revivals, but they were strongly outnumbered by the alcohol supporters. The wealthy planters still enjoyed drinking as a social activity. Small farmers benefited economically from distilling. The temperance movement of the early nineteenth century accounted for 44 percent of the population of the country, but only eight percent of the South; none of the southern states adopted prohibition in this time period.  Many immigrants had settled in the South along the frontier, making this issue strongly divided among the North and the South; these immigrants came from backgrounds where drinking was a dominate part of their culture. Many of these immigrants had settled along Virginia's frontier, making Virginia a wet state where alcohol supporters outnumbered prohibition supporters. Despite this tension, alcohol remained dominant in the social scene of the South in the early nineteenth century and many farmers sought to distill their own alcohol as Mr. Austin did."],"display_date":"September 30, 1817 - October 7, 1817","search_date":"1817-10-03","locations":[{"id":13687,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2660,"title":"Sex Across The Color Line\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-16","end_date":"1895-03-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The town did not look on Thomas J.

The biggest mystery of all was the disappearance of Lina Hanna's mother and sister. Many suspect that Penn, in order to silence the witnesses, murdered both women. Some townsfolk believed that he discarded of the bodies in another state. Regardless, Penn was successful in covering up his actions and destroyed any way of himself being accused of such a violent crime. Penn terrified Hanna's mother and sister, and they did not want to accuse him in fear of the possible consequences. ","White masters raping their young black workers was a frequent occurrence, before, during and after the Civil War. This instance involving Hanna and Penn was just one of many situations in which sex crossed the color line. Some were voluntary actions of both parties, while some, such as the story of Lina Hanna, were rapes. ","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year. Each week the names, race, alleged crimes, place lynched, and date of the lynching were listed for all those who had been lynched during that year. Each week someone picked up the newspaper to see if anyone had been lynched since the previous week.

Lawrence Brown, an African American, accused of arson near Cranbury, South Carolina, was the first one to be lynched in 1897. At least one out of the 28 lynched were white. Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill, lynching was community-sanctioned murder, and death was usually accompanied by torture and mutilation. Lynching did not start to decrease until the 1950s.

He was brutally shot in the head with a pistol and stabbed. He was also robbed of a reported 1600. The notes were from the Bank of Virginia. His body was found dumped near a road. According to witnesses, Simpson and the man later revealed as his murderer, William F. Hoose, spent two days together in the same tavern. They did not know each other before this encounter. Simpson was in the area to conduct business. They had lunch together because Simpson took a liking to the young Hoose. After lunch, the witness reported that Simpson and Hoose left the tavern together. Soon after that, Hoose returned back to the tavern by himself and kept pacing back and forth. He asked the landlord about buying a horse from him and the price. He went to Leesburg, where he was arrested for the murder of William Simpson. He was thrown in the Leesburg Jail and held there until his execution. He stole the money for gambling purposes. Historian Henry P. Lundsgarde argues in the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture </em>that, during this time period, the South lead the nation in violent offenses against persons.

As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount?s claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent. However, their conclusion did little to sway Andy Blount's ultimate fate."],"display_date":"February 14, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-14","locations":[{"id":12056,"lat":35.2006308637,"lng":-85.2180291091,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2718,"title":"Feuds Between the North and South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-26","end_date":"1895-01-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Judge M.L. Buchwalter lived in Cincinnati, Ohio. He convicted a prisoner and sent him to Kentucky. Once he arrived in Kentucky, not long after he got off the train, the prisoner was lynched. This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial. The situation with Hampton and Buchwalter highlighted the differences between the perspectives on lynching in the South and North."],"display_date":"January 26, 1895","search_date":"1895-01-26","locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2719,"title":"The Post-War Union and Reflective Poetry\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-09-14","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" The famous poem by Francis Miles Finch entitled The Blue and the Grey commemorates soldiers who fought for both sides during the Civil War.<em>The Planters' Banner,</em> a local newspaper of Franklin, LA, published this poem on September 14, 1867.William T. Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2729,"title":"Guilty Until Proven Innocent?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-01-20","end_date":"1880-01-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Arthur Jordan, a large, bull-necked, thick-lipped Negro worked for the Corder family and began having relations with one of the daughters, Miss Corder.

Once word got out that a black man was having a relationship with a white woman, the people began to speculate that he must be forcing Miss Corder to have sexual relations with him. Arthur approached Miss Corder and convinced her to run away with him. Whether she did it willingly or not, it was to no avail.

Woodward mentions that it sometimes seemed that race relations at this point had deteriorated since the time of slavery instead of improving. It is unknown in this particular instance whether Arthur Jordan was guilty of raping Miss Corder and forcing her to do things against her will or if she willingly engaged.

The doctor had no obstetrics tools with him and had no other choice than to do the best he could with the limited tools he had. Richards cut a piece of tissue on each side about an inch wide and two inches long on the scalp. He pulled on this piece with his finger until it broke, pulling a large piece of tissue off the child's head. This initiated the birth and the child lived with a scar on the scalp. "," Stories such as these were reprinted in order to educate and for other doctors to understand the history of medicine and its procedures. The development and understanding of medicine soared during the late 1800s. In 1892, the Southern Medical College Association was founded with the intentions that the improvements it endorsed was to make medical education in the South conform to the superior standards of northern schools, according to John Harley Warner. The reputation of the medical education in the South according to many was inferior to the North's development in the postbellum time. "," In the years following the Civil War, the South could not delve themselves out of the poverty and stagnation. Consequently, as the New South era drew to a close in the opening years of the twentieth-century, the South was mired in backwardness and misery. Nowhere is this better seen than in science and medicine. The North trumped the South in medicine and technology. Even as the South tried to regain supremacy, the North excelled. The focus of the South was no longer to compete with the North, but instead to regain the pride and prosperity it had before the war.

Bundy and his Union comrades were invited to ride up the Red River to Shreveport on the Confederate flag-of-truce boat before a conference with southern officers about terms of surrender. Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence. This poor white man complained that his crops just began growing, but he was too poor and weak to fix the fence, whose destruction meant starvation for himself and his family."," Both Bundy and a Confederate officer felt sympathy for this man, saying so to the men stealing the wood.

According to Boles, towards the end of the war, however, conditions worsened for soldiers and civilians alike, as the economy continued to deteriorate through a lack of Confederate economic policy. Boles illuminates families' struggles with starvation, and conquering Union troops, embittered too by the continuing war, made fewer exemptions for civilians, feeling less guilt at taking fence rails and other amenities. Bundy and his comrades were en route to finalize surrender by the Louisiana armies and still civilians suffered at the hand of apathetic officials. Bundy, unable to forget the unfortunate fate of this family, witnessed a typical tragedy throughout the poverty-stricken South, a family unable to sustain itself and apathy of exhausted officials.

He discovered in this letter as well that Hudson was not going to be going into town quite as frequently as before because of the lack of service provided by the mail system so he would not be picking up his correspondence quite as frequently. ","After the Civil War was over, a primary concern for many was that without slave labor, it became more difficult to be prosperous agriculturally. For example, in Hudson's life, without slaves, planting and agriculture took over most aspects of his life. He became much more conscious of the weather patterns to the point that he began informing his friends about those in correspondence. As many farmers were feeling the same pressures Mr. Hudson was facing where agriculture dominated their lives, organizations like the Agricultural Wheel or the Farmer's Alliance developed. These groups claimed to stand for the interests of small producers and drew on the political support of the Greenbackers. Both of these institutions attempted to improve the farmer's standing in the competitive marketplace. Michael Holt says that even though these institutions excluded blacks, the blacks were also able to mobilize on their own to achieve some of the same things in the field of agriculture. This was not just a white phenomenon where they had to labor and try to be prosperous with their agriculture; the blacks also faced many of the same struggles."],"display_date":1887,"search_date":"1887-07-02","locations":[{"id":14212,"lat":38.6845288469,"lng":-78.1593262248,"zoom":10,"place":"RAPPAHANNOCK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2745,"title":"Calvin Gray&#39;s Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-12-24","end_date":"1882-12-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the night of December 24, 1882, near the town of Mooresburg in Hawkins   County, Tennessee, African American Calvin Gray was accused of stealing hogs on Mrs. Joseph Gill's farm. He was later released for lack of evidence. On the following Saturday, December 30, an unknown group of people sought retribution for the alleged robbery and bombarded Gray's home, pounding violently on the door and walls of his house. No serious outcome resulted from that night's altercation, but the party returned to Gray's home on the following evening, repeated the hostility, and demanded that Gray come out to discuss his thievery. Gray refused to appear, and members of the group tore a plank of wood from Gray's door and repeatedly shot into the house through the hole. Gray received bullet wounds in the arm and stomach and died from his injuries. A man named Jim Williams also received serious wounds in the gunfire, as a shot in the forehead resulted in his death five days later. Calvin's stepson received a bullet wound in the leg, but was not fatally injured. Nine or ten people were arrested for their involvement in the bombardment, but all were released for lack of proof of their involvement. ","Gray's story reveals the disparate attitudes that whites possessed toward African Americans in Hawkins   County, Tennessee in the nineteenth century. The Hawkins County legal system treated Gray fairly, dismissing his crime for lack of proof and releasing him even though he was black. However, Gray's murderers did not grant him the same respect, as they violently assaulted him for unproven petty thievery. Gray's death displays the duplicitous nature of many southern whites in the late nineteenth century, as Gray's killers repaid an apparent legal injustice with an even more repulsive injustice. While Gray's killers believed his alleged robbery required retribution, they defied the legal system by punishing Gray outside of the system and by enacting a punishment egregiously disproportionate to the crime. ","Gray's murder served as an informal, citizen-organized judicial system, fulfilling historian Edward Ayers' argument that whites lynched alleged black offenders in the nineteenth century to uphold their perception of justice and to terrorize blacks into acquiescence. While the white mob did not lynch Gray, they terrorized him and might have lynched him if he had succumbed to their demands to exit his house. Instead, he was killed by gunshot for allegedly stealing a few hogs. Ayers argues that the majority of lynched African Americans in the nineteenth century South were tortured and killed for charges of murder, rape, or violation of white womanhood; however, Calvin Gray was hunted down, terrorized, and killed for the alleged robbery of a few hogs. Such disproportionate punishment suggests that some whites in the late nineteenth century possessed an even more severe hatred for blacks than previous accounts indicate.

McDowell's plow struck the side of a heavy object and he dug through the ground to discover a burnt clay sepulchre. He pulled a small portion of an arm out of the dirt and waited for a scientist to properly disinter the entire sepulchre. The sepulchre was a long slab, almost seven feet long and four feet wide and the underside held the complete cast of a human body. McDowell surmised that a people group in the distant past had buried the sepulchres in shallow graves, covered the bodies with clay, and piled wood upon them to consume them with fire. As a result, the burnt clay sepulchres became hardened slabs. McDowell found several similar sepulchres several years earlier when he first farmed his land in Macon  County, but he destroyed the relics through plowing his field. Initially, no Native American scholars trusted the authenticity of McDowell's discovery, as they did not believe Native Americans buried their dead in such a manner. Nevertheless, McDowell's discovery of the sepulchres in 1872 proved the validity of his find. ","McDowell acquired his Macon County land in 1821 after Cherokee Indian communities abandoned the region due to white American expansionism. In a letter to the Scientific American, McDowell emphasized the pleasure he experienced when he first acquired his own land, expressing the spirit of romance he felt when pioneering his small farm. McDowell greatly benefited from the removal of the Cherokee natives from North   Carolina and expressed great interest in their practices.","Historian Steven Conn argues that mid to late nineteenth-century historians developed interest in the study of prehistory and formed the belief that Native Americans were living examples of prehistory. The academic scholarship in late nineteenth-century America began to treat Native Americans as objects of anthropological science. However, the late nineteenth-century historical movement concurrently served to write Native Americans out of the romantic narrative of American history. Thus, Native Americans were treasured for their ability to provide glimpses into the deep American past and were simultaneously removed from the American historical future because of their inability to fit into the white majority's view of American identity. McDowell's story supports Conn's view of the dichotomous treatment of Native Americans. McDowell prized the importance of the Indian sepulchres he discovered, and yet, felt blessed by the land he acquired from the Cherokees' migration in the early eighteenth century. McDowell failed to recognize the dichotomy that existed between his passion for ancient Indian artifacts and the personal benefits he obtained through the oppression of Native Americans."],"display_date":"June 16, 1872","search_date":"1872-06-16","locations":[{"id":9598,"lat":35.237570606,"lng":-83.4949345538,"zoom":9,"place":"MACON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2767,"title":"Klan Murders Senator Stephens\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-05-24","end_date":"1870-05-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Three days passed before the news of Senator Stephens? assassination reached Maria Massey Barringer. On May 21, 1870, Republican Senator John W. Stephens was murdered at the Caswell County Courthouse by members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). On account of his political principles, Stephens was stabbed, choked, and left dying on a woodpile in a rear room of the courthouse. Prior to his murder Stephens had been advised by Victor Barringer that his life was threatened by the KKK, however Stephens ignored the warning. When the lynching of four blacks did not catch the attention of the citizens, the Klan was determined to take the life of a white man. Stephens supported the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League, and helped to politically organize the black population of Caswell County. The Freedmen's Bureau not only intervened in white Southerners economic relations with black laborers, but it also helped to mobilize these laborers into the Republican Party. As a result, Senator Stephens became an enemy to the white Democratic Party. Governor William W. Holden responded to the challenge of the KKK, by illegally declaring martial law and sending troops into Caswell County. Local law enforcement could not cope with the hit-and-run tactics of the Klan, and Holden knew that nothing short of martial law would suppress them.","The function of Klan violence was to socially and economically curb Republicans and control the black population. After the Democrats gained control of the legislature in 1870, they impeached and convicted Holden for illegally declaring martial law. As historians Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris emphasized, the Klan?s use of violence was temporarily effective in securing political power. They were willing to use any means necessary to end Republican control of their states, thus stopping the threat to white supremacy.

The Presbyterian Clergyman was wounded but was expected to recover.  In Athens, the Southern Banner reported this incident stating that though they did not know the details, they feel fully justified in saying that no provocation whatever, was given by [Mr. Davis], to cause this outrage.","Travelers through the antebellum South faced many dangers. Among the most frightening to white travelers was the possibility of coming into contact with Indians. In the 1830?s, the threat of Indian attacks was heightened as a result of President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act and the treaties that followed.  During this period, Jackson used treaties to try to force Indians of the five nations that resided in the southeastern United States - the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chicasaw and Seminole - to migrate west. While some Indians agreed to move, others resisted Jackson's efforts and chose to stay. Most of the population of both the Creeks and the Cherokees would have remained in Georgia and Alabama in 1835 when Davis was traveling. Without protection against land hungry white settlers, though, the Indians that stayed often lost their land and were left destitute. Frustrated with their situation and angry with Jackson and their white neighbors for trying to force them off of their land, Indians were known to steal from and attack white neighbors and passers-by. ","In its report of this incident, the Athens' <em>Southern Banner </em>implied that the Indian attacker was unprovoked in the outrage he or she committed. The article did not consider the probable outrage the Indian felt at the marginalization and poverty he or she faced. In hindsight, the title of the article, Indian Outrage, might be read as an outraged Indian taking out his frustration over the actions of President Jackson. As this article's perspective shows, white southerners at this time lacked such sympathy for the Indians. The same lack of sympathy was visible in the incident of the Trail of Tears, when Indian nations were forced to migrate and walk across the South to new homes. ","The aggression that existed between white southerners and the Indians was both a result of and a contributor to the theories of rationalizing the forced migration.  President Jackson argued that the Indians would be better off in the Western lands where they would not have to face attacks from white southerners.  This theory that it would be better for the Indians if they moved, created even less sympathy in white southerners towards those who chose to stay."],"display_date":"January 15, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-15","locations":[{"id":1654,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2810,"title":"Raging Measles in Ruckdale, Texas","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-12-29","end_date":"1876-12-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 29, 1876, D.F.M.

As the proud mother of two Confederate soldiers, James and Hines, Zillah found strength in her Bible. In her diary, Zillah wrote of her fear for her sons' safety and her pride in their dedication to the Confederate struggle for independence, but always found comfort in God's words. When both James and Hines were killed in service in late 1862, Zillah's worst fears were realized. On January 9, 1863, she wrote in her diary that the remains of our dear sons...reached home last Monday 5th of January 1863. Zillah's unwavering Christian faith consoled her and she explained that although I wept sore and do weep yet I know that in our heavenly Father's house are many mansions. It was a comfort to Zillah to know that her sons shared her religious devotion. Reverend S.S. Russell, a soldier who fought along side of James and Hines, reassured Zillah that he could testify that they had been living demonstrations that men by the grace of God could live Christians under any circumstances.","Religion was of great importance to southerners like Zillah. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, evangelical denominations provided education to women prior to the Civil War. Because religion was so closely tied to knowledge, women were especially religious in the South. After the Great Awakening of the nineteenth century (religious revivals in the South), evangelical Christianity became a bedrock of southern culture. The impact was felt even stronger by women because religion was family oriented. Women like Zillah raised their children according to their religious beliefs, and in Zillah's case, those beliefs were devout. Religion was also somewhat of an equalizer; women and men were equal in God's eyes in terms of sin. Women were free to ask for forgiveness of their sins just as men were.","To Zillah Brandon and women like her, religion was not just a matter of church on Sunday.

Her parents had thrown her out of their house when they discovered she was pregnant, and while she had tried to seek refuge at several other houses, she was repeatedly refused, and the barn was her only option for shelter as she gave birth. The child, however, did not survive, and died shortly after its delivery. The young mother picked up her baby's body and tried to walk to a nearby house, but fainted on the way over, and was found by the family who owned the barn. They called in Dr. Martin, but he could not save the mother who suffered from hypothermia and an excessive loss of blood. She died the following day. Davie Times, a resident of the town where Graves died, heard this sad story and wrote the Salisbury Truth in order to comment on what he believed was the family's and neighbors' terrible and inhuman behavior. He was shocked that an event like this could take place in a Christian community. "," Whether or not the people Times considered responsible for Graves' death were apprehended and punished is unknown. What is known, however, is that Graves' premarital pregnancy reflected an issue in the South that provoked much controversy, particularly in the late 19th century. Patriarchal society was firmly entrenched at this time as well as the notion that all Southern women were pious, gentle, and modest daughters, wives, and mothers. North Carolinian law reinforced this concept, making a woman legally bound to reveal the name of her illegitimate baby's father. The local government would then force him to provide money for child support if need be, ensuring that neither the mother nor child would not become a ward of the state. The mother's punishment usually varied from a monetary fine to a damaged reputation, a simple notion with heavy penalties in a society that placed emphasis on the purity and innocence of respectable women. "," By the end of the 19th century, premarital pregnancy was steadily decreasing as the structure and sexual repression of the Victorian era began tightened. According to historians Daniel Scott and Michael Hindus, an upsurge in religious activity also lowered the number of premarital pregnancies at this time, especially in the South where the evangelical movement of the Social Gospel was strongest. A woman who was guilty of fornication and bastardy would have sullied not only her reputation but her family's as well, claims historian Victoria Bynum, and therefore it was not uncommon for people like the Graves to refuse to accommodate their daughter during a premarital pregnancy since they were regarded as social pariahs and outsiders. However, while a stronger religious presence in the South led to more stringent moral policies and a reduction in pregnancy out of wedlock, it also defined Christian morals and values more clearly. This new and strengthened Christian community made the Graves and their neighbors' actions look like sins as they failed to forgive the young woman and treat her with compassion that the Bible extols. The parallels between her story and the Biblical story of the birth of Jesus (Mary and Joseph being rejected from several inns, only to find shelter in a manger where she gave birth to the baby Jesus) only reinforced this notion. However, while Times' reaction to this event was supported by countless other people, many Southern communities continued to spurn and reject those young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.

There had been much disease spread throughout Texas in this time, but this epidemic was unrecognizable. The symptoms were such as cholera or yellow fever, which had previously desolated the population in San Antonio, and more widely, throughout Texas. ","Cholera is usually transmitted through either the consumption of contaminated water. First seen in the early nineteenth century in Bengal, this disease proceeded to spread to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. There had been a large outbreak of cholera in the late 1860s, which had turned into quite an epidemic around Texas. Today, this epidemic is generally seen in third-world countries. ","In Texas, cholera went hand in hand with yellow fever. Though the symptoms of cholera are quite different than those of yellow fever, these two diseases came to Texas around the same time. Yellow fever, derived generally from mosquito bites, was a reoccurring problem in Texas from the early 1830s through the turn of the century. ","The symptoms of cholera are mainly diarrhea and vomiting, whereas those symptoms for yellow fever are body aches, jaundice, and elevated body temperature. This new advertised disease had similar symptoms, but these symptoms were much worse, though the disease proved less fatal. As far as doctors could tell, they believed this disease was called consumption. ","Consumption is another name for tuberculosis, which today is one of the most prominent diseases in the world, affecting people at the rate of one person per second. This epidemic in San Antonio, however, was not consumption of the lungs, as is typical today, but of a general decay or arrest of the vital processes of nutrition. The tuberculosis virus can infect practically all parts of the human body, which it seemed to do in this case. Symptoms of tuberculosis include loss of energy or weight, fever, and poor appetite. San Antonio doctors said that at the time, the only found remedy was liver oil, though this was debatable because of the terrible taste which prohibited many patients from being able to swallow it.","Today we have the tuberculin skin test that can help diagnose tuberculosis within three days, but in Texas in the late 1800s, they did not have tools such as this.

Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize. He was lambasted by the Cleveland Gazette, which called his defense of the monstrous franchise provision...a disgrace to the race and to our civilization, and wished he had never been born. For all of their objections, however, Mississippi, and the rest of the South, as many other states followed suit, plunged itself headfirst into a half-century of legal disenfranchisement and discrimination.

The Michigan fields are being heavily drawn upon, while the crop in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin is eminently encouraging, thus relieving fears of an ice shortage. This was especially good news for Mr. Beasly of Crystal Springs, Mississippi, who ten years earlier had build an ice-house in his town in order to supply his neighbors with ice. Beasly had recognized that the ice trade was not only extremely important to warmer climate areas, such as Mississippi and much of the South, but also could be very profitable.","By the 1800s, of ice harvesting had been around for centuries. According to world-renown ice-historian Mariana Gosnell, the so-called ice craze really started in Boston, when a man named Frederick Tudor, in the manner of a drug pusher, set out [in 1805] to create a taste for cold that would get customers hooked. Over the next few decades, Tudor and his foreman Nathaniel Wyeth succeeded in refining the mass cultivation and shipping processes of ice. Harvesting the ice from the fields, which were, in fact, very, very much more than frozen over lakes and ponds, became an intricate and precisely designed process. According to Gosnell, once a thick layer of ice formed over a field, it would be scraped clean, shined, and then carved into a checker pattern of large ice blocks with a single bladed plow. Using saws the blocks were cut free and then, using large pike poles, floated through a carved out channel to a collection area. Although one might think this process would eventually dry out the lake or pond being used, the process apparently removed from a 400-square-foot ice field...each year [an amount of water that is] less than the total amount of water that evaporates from the surface of the very same lake during a single hot summer day. Much less. ","Thus, despite the ice machine's invention as early as 1850 and emergence of ice plants, neither of which were in widespread usage (religious skepticism being one of the reasons against), Tudor and others that had caught on began to sell ice in massive quantities literally all over the world. In fact, according to Gosnell, for years [in the nineteenth century] ice was America's second-biggest crop by weight to be transported by trains and ships, with the first being cotton. Much of that weight undoubtedly went through the South, not only for the preservation of foods, but also because no self respecting Southerner would drink his bourbon warm or her Dom Perignon above the temperature of 38 degrees Farenheit, excepting, perhaps, Jill Masterson.","Upon receiving a shipment of ice, a southern city or town would store it in pits, caves, or trenches underground; in cavities mostly underground but with roofs, or entry structures above ground; or entirely above ground, in insulated houses. Judging by the blurb in the Crystal Springs Monitor, Mr. Beasly's construction was most likely the latter, and was probably painted white to reflect sunlight and to make it look more like an igloo. Between its outer and inner walls there would be some type of insulation, be it tanners, bark, charcoal, sawdust, hay, straw, [or] shavings. With the proper construction, Beasly would be able to maintain approximately 70-90 percent of his stored ice, sometimes for many years. Nevertheless, as the 1890 Clarion Ledger blurb referred to a possible ice famine in the summer, Beasly and the area his business supplied were most likely in want of a fresh shipment."],"display_date":"March 13, 1890 - December 31, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-06","locations":[{"id":7008,"lat":31.8692302776,"lng":-90.4488242966,"zoom":9,"place":"COPIAH, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2853,"title":"The Constant Threat of Disease\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-08-08","end_date":"1865-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 8, 1865, the Montgomery Advertiser warned its readers to look out for cholera.

Perhaps the most important news of the letter was the complication during child birth that her other daughter Mollie had gone through two days before. Mrs. Wyche noticed her daughter was acting strangely and sent Walter, one of her sons, for a doctor or and old woman. Mrs. Wyche told her son to first call a Doctor and then on Martha Wade, who presumably was a trained midwife.","Although the practice of midwifery is no longer in widespread use, during the nineteenth century it was still a part of American culture. It is true that the practice had begun to take a secondary role to trained male doctors among middle and upper class white citizens, but the practice had not entirely faded. It was especially prevalent, note Richard and Dorothy Wertz, among isolated whites (and others). Certainly, on their plantation, Green Lawn, the Wyches were somewhat isolated, as were many living on farms or plantations in the South at the time; if a doctor could not be found immediately, a midwife would have to be called upon, which was exactly Octavia Wyche's understanding of the situation on February 15, 1885.","The practice of midwifery had changed dramatically in America since colonial times, when after, 1750, American men began to return from medical education abroad to practice in colonial towns and cities. The Wertzs note that this began the involvement of men in childbirth, and it was men who actually at first began the practice of educated midwifery. The training spread to women, and In the years after 1810... the practice of midwifery in American towns took on the same unregulated, open market character it had in England where men and women of various levels of training competed to attend births.","During the latter half of the nineteenth century, however, women began to be excluded from midwifery. Despite the fact that American doctors were not as well trained as their more formally educated European counterparts and therefore well trained and experienced midwives most likely could have done the job just as well, it came to be regarded as unthinkable to confront women with the facts of medicine or to mix men and women in training, even for such an event as birth. Nevertheless, by 1885 midwifery was once again being practiced by women such as Martha Wade. Perhaps this is due to the expansion, however slowly, of women's rights during the time. ","Ultimately the decision whether or not to employ a midwife would have been up to Mollie Wyche, and she apparently decided to consult at least one trained midwife as well as at least one doctor. The Wertzs note that it was probably very wise of Mollie Wyche to use not only a trained midwife, but also a woman who had herself borne a child and who might be more patient and discerning about birth processes. The level of experience of Martha Wade is not known, but presumably her being an old woman implies a higher level. Unfortunately, Walter Wyche could find neither Martha Wade nor a doctor in time, and Mollie Wych miscarried. For all of Walter's searching, however, it is unlikely Martha Wade or any doctor could have done much to prevent the sad event."],"display_date":"February 15, 1885 - February 17, 1885","search_date":"1885-02-16","locations":[{"id":7161,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2872,"title":"On Lynching\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-11-05","end_date":"1891-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On November 5, 1891, the Jackson Clarion Ledger accused Texas Governor James Stephen Hogg of being vain for offering a reward for the apprehension of parties engaged in a lynching bee, the subject being a negro. The lynchers, according to the newspaper, would never be prosecuted. On March 27 of the previous year, the same newspaper reported that levee cutters would be properly cared for by the citizens of Bolivar county, as ropes and trees are plentiful up there. Thus it seems that lynching, for American Southerners, was simply an every-day fact of life; according to the Cleveland Gazette, the man in lynched in Texas was just one of 235 that year. Judging by later statistics, a proportionally large amount of those most likely occurred in Mississippi. ","Many if not all of those 235 lynching victims in 1891 were blacks, as African Americans were often the targets of lynch mobs . As the first blurb points out, it was common for whites of the South (and indirectly, by their indifference, the North) to simply let mob justice take its course, in order to, according to Michael Pfeifer, supposedly serve the purposes of local elites and other whites in relieving both economic and sexual anxieties. As white men saw it, the most overt kinds of opposition to their supremacy were frequently represented in these two forms. (Later, according to the Cleveland Gazette, white women of the south would take the take the charge in putting a stop to this mentality and to lynching). Thus the tensions in the South leading to lynchings were deeper simply skin color, although, according to Philip Dray, it was because of skin color that the accusations against those being sought out for lynching were often amplified and exaggerated by individuals in order to incite mobs.","During the late 1800s, according to Johnathan Markovitz, lynchings were carefully designed to convey to black persons in this country that they had no power and nothing else whites were obligated to respect. They were, in other words, used as measures of intimidation in order to prolong a society of white supremacy. Often, mobs of whites would turn lynchings into violent public spectacles, punishing one or two blacks to supposedly, as put by a Mayor of New Orleans, cause the others [to] trouble you no more.","Not all whites supported lynch mobs, however. Governor Hogg certainly did not appreciate the Law of the Mob. As Pfeifer points out, many others, such as Andrew Augustus Gunby, spoke out against lynchings and in support of law and order. They did so, however, often at the risk of their jobs and reputations, as Gunby blamed his stance on the lynching matter for his loss in the Democratic nomination for Congress from Louisiana's Fifth District in 1886. Additionally, Gunby, as many anti-lynching whites most likely did, spoke out in support of white supremacy; it is not as if he was anti-lynching because he believed in the equality of black men and women, he simply wanted the law to be upheld.","This is not the entire story of lynching in the South, however, as it seems things had changed by 1899. The Clarion Ledger, on September 14 and 21 of that year, published articles supporting the decision of the Governor McLaurin to call out the militia for the purpose of detering a lynch mob (an the militia followed his order), and lamenting the lynching of an innocent black man in Lawrence County, thus pointing out the wrongs of lynching. Although the paper still (somewhat paradoxically) supported lynching for rape, the evil [must] stop here. This seems to be, and is in a small way, a complete moral reversal of earlier values espoused by the paper (and supposedly therefore the average Mississippian). Unfortunately, there were some alternate motives.","Interestingly (and horribly) enough, economics played a large part in leading white supremacists to turn away from using lynching as a tool; according to Pfeifer, in the first decades of the twentieth century, an emerging urban bourgeoisie [in the South] wary of public disorder and threats to the accumulation of capital pressed for systematic legal methods for the sustenance of white supremacy. It seemed that by the early 1900s (and according to the Ledger, as early as 1899), the efforts of anti-lynching thinkers such as W.E.B. du Bois and Ida B. Wells, an African American woman who encouraged blacks to boycott, vote, and agitate against white oppressors were causing people everywhere to pay attention to what was happening in the South. Later, as Markovitz points out, efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (founded 1909) were paying off in bringing unwanted publicity to lynchings in the South, thereby threatening business by scaring off investors; influential white businessmen began to push more and more for writing white supremacy into law in order to legitimize the systems of white supremacy as well as maintain the flow of investments into the South. ","This is not to say that lynching stopped, however. The Cleveland Gazette reported episodes of lynchings in Mississippi into the 1920s. Furthermore, it seems white supremacy itself did not bother the aforementioned investors. Many across the country simply wanted to turn a blind eye to ways in which the system was being enforced. It's even questionable as to whether or not whites across the country objected to lynching as a process, as legal lynchings became popular in the early 1900s as a somehow more just and orderly answer to pure mob violence. Thus, it seems the September Ledger issues were merely protesting the evil of mob justice."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - December 31, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-03","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2877,"title":"The Burial of John C.

Calhoun was unable to beat. Come March 4, Senator James Mason of Virginia had to read one of Calhoun's last speeches in the Senate, an ominous prediction of what the slavery debate would ultimately do to the cords which bound these states together in one common union. Calhoun never saw the cords finally snap and civil war break out. He died on March 31, 1850. ","His death led directly to a period of mourning in South Carolina, nowhere more so than in Charleston, where he was laid to rest on April 26, 1850, in St. Phillip's churchyard. The event was significant enough that both major newspapers in the city, the <em>Charleston Mercury</em> and the <em>Charleston News and Courier</em>, took the day off from publishing, but not without first spending considerable attention on the Arrangements For the Funeral of Mr. Calhoun. The papers provided astounding detail: for the march to the Citadel, for the march from the Citadel to City Hall, on the funeral services the next day, on the firing of minute guns during certain points in the procession-and several diagrams in case readers were confused. T. Leger Hutchinson, the mayor of Charleston, declared April 25 a day of mourning. ","But more important than the attention to detail each newspaper spent on explaining the procession was what the papers said in their obsequies on April 27. The <em>Mercury</em> noted the ceremonial absorbed the whole thought, and soul, and presence of the city...Charleston was as one house of mourning. The <em>News and Courier</em> said it occurred with imposing magnificence and impressive solemnity. Certainly, the words of Governor W. Benjamin Seabrook echoed the thoughts of all present: I receive...with the deepest emotions, the mortal remains of him for whom South Carolina entertained an unbounded affection.... The name John Caldwell Calhoun will live while time shall be permitted to endure.","The words and feelings of Charleston in the wake of Calhoun's burial should not be taken lightly. This episode demonstrates concretely the importance of Calhoun to the Southern psyche. As historian Gerald M. Capers puts it, Like Washington and Lincoln, in the American legend John C. Calhoun is a symbol-a symbol of the Old South which was to be destroyed in the Great Rebellion that began a decade after his death. Calhoun, South Carolina's political leader from 1824 until 1850, remained (even after his death) the physical embodiment of a much larger idea: states rights, which included the right to nullify a federal law or the right to secede from the Union. In March 1850 he predicted what would happen 10 years later, little knowing his beloved South Carolina would be the first cord to snap.

The Honor Systems essentially were guides on how to be a Southern Gentlemen. The University of Virginia's Honor Code, which in the twentieth century the university defined as only outlawing lying, cheating, and stealing, included rules against spitting in public and other such guidelines. These rules theoretically helped the school produce good Southern gentlemen. Washington College's honor system originated from General Robert E. Lee, a former president of the University, who said, We have but one rule here, and it is that every student must be a gentleman. ","In a letter to his aunt Elizabeth Ann Willson of Fairfield, Virginia, William M. Willson admitted to having troubles at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University of Lexington, Virginia). His family was not particularly wealthy, and he recognized how his father sacrificed in order to fund his education. However, Willson felt that he was completely justified in his affairs. Two of his schoolmates, his friends, were found to be drinking in their dormitories. The faculty, led by two professors in particular, subsequently expelled them from the University. Most of the student body challenged the faculty, feeling that the punishment was too harsh and that the two faculty members were acting on political motives. Suddenly, the school was divided between the faculty and the majority of its students, both sides too proud to back down. Was the university's honor code itself the cause of the open rebellion? The young men, as gentlemen, could not admit defeat; they had decided to stand by the two wronged students. Willson told his aunt that his father would be disappointed but would understand the need to do this. He assured her that he had not fallen in with a rough crowd and that all the best men were involved. The faculty faced a similar dilemma; they could either let the two students back into the university, thereby keeping all the other students, or the school could lose the majority of its young men. The all-male faculty also felt that they could not back off the issue. In fact, in the letter, Willson believed that he would soon be expelled. He desperately wished he had not been involved, but he knew that now that he was, he had no choice but to deal with the consequences. It was the honorable thing to do.","Both the North and the South displayed this stubbornness in the early days of the Civil War. The fired shot at Fort Sumter drew Lincoln into the war because he had made a threat and he was too honorable to back down. With each step the North made, southerners were faced with their baseless rants that they had made, and in order to be considered gentlemen they had to secede or fight or send their sons to fight.

Because of rampant childhood diseases and absence of many other options of sustenance for infants, breastmilk played a vitally important role in the development of society and families. Many slaveholding women designated enslaved women to be wet nurses for the newly born white children. As Robert Mallard describes in his memoir, As a babe, I drew a part at least of my nourishment from the generous breasts of a colored foster mother. Growing up on a plantation in Georgia, Mallard was certainly one of many young children who were cared for primarily by slaves instead of his own parents. "," This use of enslaved women as wet nurses caused a great deal of debate among Southerners. Many slave holding women did not even see nursing their children as part of their normal responsibilities as mothers. Other women however did look upon this practice with a skeptical and critical eye. In one woman's judgment, 'that woman is but half a mother who does not suckle her own children'","Many southerners were disconcerted by this practice of allowing an enslaved woman to be the primary care taker, however, Mallard felt quite differently. He wrote that his colored foster mother...always held a peculiar place in my regards. A black nurse taught me, it is probable, my first steps and first words, and was as proud of both performances as the happy mother herself. Mallard clearly has an ambiguous relationship with his wet nurse, as he shows by choosing the word peculiar to describe it. Enslaved women acting as wet nurses also had tenuous feelings toward their job as nurse. Most slave women who had children of their own were only allowed one or two months away from their duties before their masters required them to return to work, leaving their children with another slave. Being deprived of time with their own children, enslaved women must have resented time with their slave master's children. In Stephen V. Ash's book A Year in the South: 1865, he describes how Matilda Hughes, an enslaved woman, had to work so much that her twins died because she was unable to breastfeed them often enough. If enslaved women's children died of neglect, how must they have felt when asked to care for other children? But other historians have asserted that often, slave women caring for white children did form strong attachments with these children. This contradiction between motherhood and slavery lies at the heart of Mallard's narrative, and, though Mallard might have seen his childhood through rose colored glasses, this ambiguity unsettled the very core of the domestic household in the South."],"display_date":"1830 - 1835","search_date":"1832-12-31","locations":[{"id":1991,"lat":31.6671183532,"lng":-81.1853351386,"zoom":9,"place":"LIBERTY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2913,"title":"Opium Abuse in Barnwell, SC","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-05-07","end_date":"1850-05-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 7, 1850, Dr. John William Ogilvie traveled eight miles to a plantation in Barnwell County, SC in response to a reported overdose of Laudanum, or a tincture of opium. The patient had attempted suicide, swallowing the tincture at 4:15 that morning. Arriving at 7:15 AM, Dr. Ogilvie found him still alive. Apparently in a state of melancholy, the patient was conscious and calm, but expressed regret that the doctor had come as he still wished to die. Dr. Ogilvie, however, proceeded to treat the patient without any apparent difficulty. Initially, he administered ten doses of zinc sulphate solution, five minutes apart. The patient began to vomit fifteen minutes after the last dose, and Dr. Ogilvie smelled and saw the drug in his regurgitated fluids. The doctor then proceeded to put a tube down his patient's throat and forced four pints of warm water into the man's stomach. Dr. Ogilvie left at 10:45 AM, his patient stabilized and quickly recovering.","Depression was one of the most serious consequences of opium addiction, and so Dr. Ogilvie's patient might well have been a long-term abuser of the drug. Up until the twentieth century, most opium abusers became addicted to the drug after having it prescribed as a pain treatment. Pharmacists often dispensed it without a prescription, or the doctor would leave an additional supply with the patient's family. The drug was not only pleasurable, but also highly addictive and widely available. Historically, southern whites were the most susceptible to opium addiction, and prior to 1900, the addiction primarily affected the middle- and upper-class. Country physicians actually had the highest rate of addiction among nineteenth century professions. Although Dr. Ogilvie's notes do not suggest that he was an opium abuser himself, he was likely very familiar with the addiction, which perhaps accounts for his successful and evidently calm response to this suicide attempt.","The most significant incidence of opium abuse in the United States occurred during the Civil War, when an estimated 400,000 soldiers became addicted to the drug. Opium and morphine were two of the few painkillers that wartime surgeons could access; they prescribed it as an anesthetic for major surgeries and amputations, as well as for the treatment of painful diseases. Dependency was likely heightened by soldiers' traumatic experiences during the war, which often led to depression. David Courtwright suggests that a more gradual increase in abuse between 1830 and 1860 affected the rate of addiction during and after the Civil War. This growth was the consequence of several cholera and dysentery outbreaks during that time period-including one between 1847 and 1851, just before this patient's attempted suicide-as these diseases were regularly treated with opiates. During the nineteenth century, the abuse of drugs like laudanum and morphine was not unusual or frowned upon, as Dr. Ogilvie's notes suggest. As a result, addiction became more commonplace because nobody thought it was important to regulate these substances.

In total, Sally Smith was ordered to pay five relatives two hundred and seventy seven dollars and seventy cents.  In addition to this ruling, the court stated that Sally Smith should not charge Joseph B.

The slave got up after four weeks of bed rest and subsequently entered a delusional state. The plantation's overseer, Hal Sonbeck, sent for the Doct and he cupt it and bled it and blistered it but he cold not rase it anymore. In a letter to the plantation owner, Iveson Lewis Brookes, Hal informed his master of the death, but was also quick to explain that Lily's old ist daughter lived for only eleven days when she caught typhoid, and that there has been a grate many dide in this neighborhood with the same fevor. A neighboring estate had lost two slaves to the illness as well.","Those living in slave quarters were highly vulnerable to infection, which spread easily among slaves with poor hygiene, living in close, unventilated buildings. Flies transmitted the disease from infected fecal matter, which was often disposed of too close to housing structures. Potable water was often unavailable. According to John Vlach, one Mississippi planter described the average slave accommodation as well-calculated to generate disease. The planters were generally aware of this risk; they knew that slave dwellings would ideally be clean, ventilated, and far apart. Slaveholders, however, often deemed the effort to improve living conditions too costly and time consuming to be worthwhile.","Malnutrition, which was standard for many African Americans in the South, was another possible cause of typhoid death in slave populations. An essay written by a Georgia planter-physician, also in Vlach's book, refers to an 1850 typhoid outbreak near Brookes' plantation and during the same year that Sonbeck wrote this letter. The physician claims that slave violence over food caused the highly contagious fever, and when the slaves were given a nourishing diet, the diseased stopped spreading. This outbreak may not have been related to the one in question, but slaves were certainly more susceptible to disease when their immune systems were weakened by malnutrition. ","Other factors may have contributed to the slave's death as well. For instance, plantation owners generally made all medical decisions concerning their slaves and medical expenses, so Brookes' absence during the time of the outbreak may have slowed the process of procuring medical treatment. Slaves also were often denied medical care if the overseers believed they were faking their illness, and exhaustion from being overworked could weaken the immune system. ","Plantation owners and their overseers often had notoriously bad relationships, and Sonbeck's letter suggests a fear that his master would blame him for the death of his slave. He hopes that the other nearby typhoid deaths will exonerate him from blame, and indeed, Sonbeck probably was not at fault. The deceased's slave's status, however, probably did cause his illness and eventually his death. Slaves were more likely to contract such diseases, and were also more likely to die from them."],"display_date":"April 16, 1850","search_date":"1850-04-16","locations":[{"id":1739,"lat":31.9945164675,"lng":-83.7889236929,"zoom":9,"place":"DOOLY, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2957,"title":"Premature Death of Mary P.

Mrs. Mary B. Bondurant of Bedford County, Virginia, succumbed to consumption at the startlingly young age of thirty-four. She died on August 1st, 1864 in Lynchburg and was survived by her husband, John P. Bondurant. Three of her sisters had already suffered equal fates at the hands of the slow wasting disease.","Her obituary, which took up two full columns, detailed mostly the religious aspects of her life, stating that at nineteen she decided to commit herself fully to the church. She was Methodist. Among her many attributes, the obituary cited her meek, quiet nature, and her extreme piety. The author touted her as a loving wife and devoted member of the church, although it did not mention any children. Although the actual newspaper in which this obituary appeared is unknown, W.D. Cabell of Nelson County, Virginia saved and pasted a copy into his journal in 1864. The clipping is pasted into the first page of his 1864 journal, and the subsequent entries do not explain his connection to Mrs. Bondurant. ","Women in the South during this period were prized namely for their virtues, and much less for their abilities. Because of slave labor, women of any wealth did not have to cook, clean, sew, or do other women's work, since it was all relegated to the female slaves. Thus, the attributes that were most sought-after in southern women were fairly unique to the South. As shown by the obituary, religiosity and commitment to one's church were extremely important. A demure, submissive manner is also praised, as well as complete devotion to husband and family. Beauty is also extolled, although that at least is certainly not unique to the South. ","Joshua D. Rothman, in his book <em>Notorious in the Neighborhood</em>, provides some examples of the culture that shapes southern white women in this time period. Although his book deals mainly with interracial sex between white men and black women, he does mention the attitudes of the white women who are forced to live with their husbands' scandalous indiscretions. Even in the face of amoral behavior, white women were expected to remain paragons of serenity, devotion, and docility."],"display_date":"August 1, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-01","locations":[{"id":13657,"lat":37.3167903952,"lng":-79.5201576467,"zoom":9,"place":"BEDFORD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2968,"title":"Delage&#39;s Last Days\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-07-01","end_date":"1841-07-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When Natalie Delage fell ill in 1841, she found support in the community around her.

They prescribed all sorts of medicines: Castor oil salts, elixirs, chocolates, chicken broth, snake root, and creamor tartar.  She took magnesia, took Emitics, took cathartics.  But throughout her health problems, Delage engaged in her daily activities - saying prayers, visiting friends and doctors, reading books, and writing letters.

The gender differences were spatialized: men participated in public affairs as providers and legislators while women inherited the domestic sphere of everyday life.  On the plantation, women formed associations based on religion and domesticity.  Jean E. Friedman notes in <em>The Enclosed Garden </em>how the participation in evangelical communities prevented antebellum Southern women from forming any sort of collective identity.  The extended neighborhood kinship groups and the evangelical emphasis on the nuclear family bound women in their sexual roles.  The issue of death was formative in the community since, in the evangelical context, death was the first step in joining a supernatural community.  Friedman asserts that the networks that comforted Natalie Delage in her dying days tended to conserve traditional racist and sexist hierarchies."],"display_date":"July 1, 1840 - July 21, 1841","search_date":"1841-01-09","locations":[{"id":11654,"lat":33.8522812111,"lng":-80.2797613977,"zoom":8,"place":"SUMTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2973,"title":"Mistaken Identity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-14","end_date":"1893-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mrs. M.A. Moore, widowed mother of seven grown children, was alone in her home one morning. As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount's claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent. However, their conclusion did little to sway Andy Blount's ultimate fate."],"display_date":"February 14, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-14","locations":[{"id":12056,"lat":35.2006308637,"lng":-85.2180291091,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2975,"title":"Southern Women Help the War Effort in Florence, South Carolina","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-08-11","end_date":"1862-08-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 11, 1862, one month before Southern women were officially accepted as nurses, J. Bachman announced the importance women held in the medical effort in coastal South Carolina. She explained, in a local newspaper, a proposed arrangement concerning the delivery of imperative medical supplies to Florence, South Carolina. The Northeastern Railroad had been sending donated supplies free of charge, but there was a need for them to be properly collected and distributed. She proposed that an appointed female agent travel to Florence from wherever they might be on Tuesdays and Sundays to complete the receipt of the supplies. Ms. Bachman stressed the importance of paying prompt attention to all donations from around the country to make sure none went to waste. After all, she said, it was their sole object and view to alleviate the suffering of their brave defenders. In this way, the women of coastal South Carolina could contribute to the war effort without officially being recognized by their country. They used whatever outlet they could as an opportunity to help their beloved soldiers. ","Not until September, 1862 did the Confederate Congress officially authorize women as nurses. Thereafter, women were welcomed by the Southern army as a recognized source of medical help. In his book <em>Ordeal by Fire</em>, historian James McPhearson argues how women in the South, because of this late recognition of aid, did not play as large of a role in the war as did Northern women, since these women were allowed at an earlier time to be official nurses. However, women, such as Bachman and her partners, found ways in the South to significant ways to contribute to the war effort and assist their wounded. ","Women played a vital role in the Civil War, and without them, the war would have been very different. Female efforts during this time were especially important in the medical field, since fighting was seen solely as a man's job. They did most of the hard work in the civilian volunteer agencies that were created to aid the growing number of wounded soldiers. They were dedicated, hard-working people who earned respect and praise from officers and men. The female endeavors during the war, recognized officially or not, contributed greatly to the overall efforts that were made."],"display_date":"August 11, 1862","search_date":"1862-08-11","locations":[{"id":11591,"lat":34.1745784268,"lng":-79.4302448823,"zoom":8,"place":"MARION, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2984,"title":"Two African Americans Hung in St. James Parish, Louisiana","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-09-21","end_date":"1871-09-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Led up the stars to the wooden platform, shackled and eerily subdued, two","unnamed African American men marched solemnly to their deaths.  The guards shoved them into place while the executioner waited with anticipation for his cue to drop the platforms supporting the prisoners' feet.  The sheriff and jailer looked on with authoritative indifference; death for these two men was drawing ever closer.  Time seemed to move in slow motion as a hood and noose was carefully fitted over each man's head.  Finally, with an abrupt, grating creak, the men swung from the thick ropes as the platform doors dropped from beneath them.  Consciousness turned to darkness, emptiness, and then, it was all over."," Although hangings were a common sentence for serious crimes in the nineteenth century South, this particular scene that occurred in St. James Parish, Louisiana in September 1871 is quite unusual.  As the <em>New York Evangelist</em> reported, the two criminals, sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards shared a surprising similarity: all six of these men were African Americans.  "," Reconstruction in the South is often characterized as a time of strict white repression and violence as whites tried to reckon with the freedom of slaves within their communities.  Especially in Louisiana where many parishes had large African American populations, violence committed by whites against free slaves was paramount.  "," However, this execution complicates the model of white supremacy that was believed to crush and control all African American actions.  This event in St. James Parish, Louisiana reveals an interesting instance that questions the role of African Americans in the maintenance of law and order in the South during Reconstruction.  The names of the African Americans, both the criminals and the law enforcement officials, were not mentioned.  This coupled with the brevity of the article reveals that there was little concern for such an occurrence.  There must have been some interest in this scene, though, or else it would not have even been printed, especially in a New York publication.  Even more interesting is that this event refutes the general view of Reconstruction characterized by brutal white law enforcement.  Whites were usually believed to exercise complete control over African Americans who broke the law.  But, this instance clearly refutes this notion.  That the sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards were all African American is quite significant.  At least in St. James Parish, African Americans were afforded some autonomy in punishing criminals of their own race.  With a hierarchy that consisted entirely of African American officials, it can be concluded that not all Southern communities had solely white-dominated structures within the realm of law enforcement."," One explanation for this remarkable set-up of law officials can be found in Ted Tunnell's <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>.  New Orleans, the largest and most important city in Louisiana at this time, was only separated from St. James by one other parish.  This close proximity allowed ideas and practices to quickly reach neighboring localities.  Furthermore, between 1870 and 1872, with the reorganization of parish boundaries immediately outside the city, New Orleans' top officials were all Republicans.  This political control was greatly beneficial to African Americans.  Republicans were more sympathetic to African American needs than Democrats, and often provided them with the necessary help to secure positions of public office.  Whether or not these law enforcement officials were in office solely because of Republican political dominance in the area at this time, it is nonetheless noteworthy that these African American men were able to govern themselves in the face of harsh white backlash so soon after the war."],"display_date":"September 21, 1871","search_date":"1871-09-21","locations":[{"id":5681,"lat":30.0360710159,"lng":-90.7802066297,"zoom":10,"place":"ST JAMES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3014,"title":"Pensioning Confederate Soldiers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-02-03","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On February 3, 1899, an aging Confederate soldier from Portsmouth, identifying himself only as C.M.B. wrote to the Virginian-Pilot in response to Senator Marion Butler's proposed bill that would open up federal pension plans to all veterans of the Civil War. Despite a divide among many Southerners about the honor of accepting federal pension, C.M.B. argues, Why then should ex Confederates prefer to burden their impoverished friends and states, rather than appeal to the generosity of this rich government.As the nineteenth century concluded, questions arose over how to deal with the health of the men the fought in the Civil War. In addition to the massive deaths incurred by both the Confederacy and the Union army, the South was forced to deal with rebuilding infrastructure, developing a new source of economic production, as well as replacing an entire generation of men lost to the war. The difficulties facing the South were furthered by the fact that Southern veterans were denied national pension that was given to aging Union soldiers. As the issue of federal pensions came to light in the final decade of the nineteenth century, many Confederate veterans had claimed that accepting the federal pensions was dishonorable and that self reliance should be the only means of economic viability. Yet, even those who proclaimed the pensions to be dishonorable knew that the lagging economy of the South made it difficult for veterans to afford to remain self-sufficient. Additionally, aging soldiers who lived off their families placed an added burden on their children that did not seem appealing, especially when Northern soldiers received government aid. The story of C.M.B. illustrates an important question regarding how best to deal with the lost cause of the South. The southern states had staked everything on the Civil War, and upon defeat were treated by the North as the losers of the War. The absolute destruction of both the Southern economy and infrastructure placed the South in an era of poverty. Consequently, as aging veterans grew too old to work, many individuals were forced to burden their families with the cost of caring for an additional family member. While industry had slowly returned to many southern cities by 1899, the need for government pensions seemed necessary to the aging veterans.

In the year of 1897 citizens of Mobile and their representative Thomas H. Smith presented a series of bills to the Alabama Senate regarding child labor reform. These bills were purported to have come from the Mobile Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. All were shot down in committees. Though these laws were for the state of Alabama, the child labor reformers saw New England as being somewhat complicit in opposing the bills. In 1901 the Alabama Child Labor Committee wrote an open appeal to the people and press of New England and received wide endorsement throughout the state, including a former governor and the representative John Craft from Mobile.","The Committee engaged New England in what they thought was an important barrier in the reform movement. They asked for the interest and aid in pushing for child labor laws in the year of 1901, telling New Englanders that the responsibility is also yours. The responsibility lay with New England because, as the committee stated, While the proportion of the children under twelve in our Northern and Southern mills is approximately the same, yet in the mills representing the Northern investments, the actual number of such children employed is twice as great as the number found in the mills controlled by Southern capital. The letter called a Massachusetts representative the aggressive and effective opposition to attempts at proposing child labor laws at the turn of the century as well as being influential in stating opposition to laws being presented in the Alabama Senate in 1897. The appeal was a call for an awakening of public interest in the matter but it also directly spoke to New Englanders whose capital was used to erect factories and mills in Alabama.","From the discourse that carried on between the two it appears that any progress on the issue was greatly impeded in 1901. The Northerners wrote back but mostly denied wrongdoing in the matter, citing only four of the forty mills in the state were northern owned. They also argued that they did support the cause for reform but mostly because they believed young children to not be intelligent enough to do good work. Indeed, it was not just the lack of support from the Northern owners and legislators that made progress difficult. Mobile did not have many mills or factories compared to the rest of Alabama so it is natural that other districts and cities in the state would not necessarily agree with their stance. As early as 1887, Alabama had already enacted child labor legislation and it had been supported by Senator Daniel Smith of Mobile. Fines of up to fifty dollars were issued for employers who violated certain laws. Children under eighteen could not work more than eight hours in mechanical or manufacturing jobs, children under fourteen could not work more than eight hours in a factory, and no child under the age of fifteen was allowed to work in mines.

His rations for four days included one pound of bacon and eighteen ounces of cornmeal, and daily half pints of peas and rice. In a deposition given after his stay, he described the fare as awful hard. Sutton also said, however, that the hospital staff was kind and attentive, and that he fared fine while he was there.

","James McPhearson makes a case in <em>Ordeal by Fire</em> to illustrate the poor medical care in the South, and Sutton's hospital experience supports this claim. Organized relief and medical work in the South was less organized than in the North. One of every six Confederate soldiers died because of his wounds, compared with one in seven Yankees. The medical experience for a Southern soldier was well enough but not of good quality.","The care of wounded soldiers was a very involved and complex entity in the Civil War. Hospitals, both private and government, were established though out the nation to tend to the incredible amounts of wounded the battles provided. Although many hospitals were created, the quality of care given in them varied greatly and could even be more detrimental to one's health. Many historians conclude that the medical services represent one of the Civil War's most dismal failures. At the same time, by the standards of the time, Civil War medical care and army health were unusually good.

However, the Confederates fought in a far different manner. They were aggressive, bold, and highly enthusiastic. Although they knew the odds were against them, Confederate soldiers continued to fight. One theory for this southern determination is that the Southerners were Celtic. The Irish and the Scottish have a long history of fighting against extreme power for their independence. According to this thought, it was in the blood of Confederate forces to fight in manners in which they would do as much damage that they could, even if this was minimal destruction.

","In Lexington, there had been all sorts of attempts in purifying the water supply in ","the city reservoirs, which had all failed until their last experiment.

Some of the ","oxygen from the water would form ozone, which, according to the article, was one of the ","most powerful disinfectants known to science, because it combined with harmful ","nitrogen, the main contributor to disease, and neutralizes them by oxidation. The ","remaining oxygen also combined with the water to make it more refreshing and crisp. ","Dead water was the term used in describing water that contained no free oxygen, thus ","that was why boiled water was flat and tasteless because it contained no oxygen. The ","running of electricity through water would also kill bacteria, another major factor in ","disease, and repel diamagnetic particles such as alkaline and metallic particles to the ","bottom of the tank. The process involved running water through three tanks at ten ","thousand volts each and disposing of the precipitate that resulted via another tube. After ","this was done, they claimed the water was crystalline in appearance, sparkles with free ","oxygen, and absolutely free from odor and taste.

D. Wren, the executer of Thomas Blackwell's estate, about the sale off this estate to take place on January 15, 1821 (or the next fair day). The sale consisted of all household and kitchen furniture as well as horses several negroes. All items were slated to be sold to the highest bidder. Credit was to be allowed for the purchase of some items; however the more expensive items (presumably the negroes) required the use of cash. The house of Thomas Blackwell was then to be rented for one year, with several negroes being hired out for the balance of the year. The last thing Wren mentioned in the notice is for anyone who had a claim against Blackwell's estate to come forward before the sale, so that they could be compensated after the sale for the balance that is owed."," The direct sale of slaves in Richmond during the early 1800s was frowned upon if it split up families or was deemed cruel in anyway. Richmond differed from plantation Virginia in this aspect, as in a city fewer slaves were needed and conditions were somewhat better. This specific sale is unusual because the enslaved people were being sold off due to the death of their master. Blackwell's estate was being auctioned to pay off debts that he had incurred during his life, and the slaves would bring in a substantial sum of money for this purpose. This episode is significant with regard to slave sales because it shows that while the sale of slaves may not have been the economic force it was in the deeper South this early in the nineteenth century, it was not so taboo that a man would shy away from posting about a sale in a commonly read newspaper."," This episode also shows how information was passed in this time period in a large city such as Richmond. The newspaper was used as a public forum for information such as this, for no better medium existed through which to inform the masses of current events. This was very important for Richmond, as the common events of daily life in the city would generally be recorded in the newspaper, making all aware of events going on in their city's daily life.

Sheriff Rogers of Jasper had in his custody the three men believed to be responsible for the murder: Floyd Woodlee, John Turner, and Cal Collins. In fact, Woodlee was the only man who confessed to the act. Sheriff Rogers was keeping the men in the county jail until such time as their trial could take place. However, a mob surrounded the jailhouse, demanding that the men be released to them. They were determined to get the men and to take them away, but the mob refrained from actually breaking into the jail with force. ","Sheriff Rogers went outside and stood among the crowd. He spoke to them calmly, rationally persuading them that justice was sure to take its course in the case. He quieted the mob with his speech and they eventually began to go home. The mob dispersed of its own accord, satisfied as it was that the three men would be found guilty and hanged anyway, with very little trouble to them. But the heat was not off. J.T. Simpson, a citizen of Jasper prognosticated that the black men would very likely be lynched, even over the protests of the sheriff, next time the mob assembled, if they were not found guilty of George Dawson's murder. ","This 1892 narrative seems to be an anomaly in the history of lynching in the South. That the local law enforcement prevented lynching in this case is particularly significant given that in this same year, the number of lynchings of black men across the south reached its peak- 155 men killed over the course of this one year. The scenario of the mob surrounding the jail, demanding that the offenders be released to them was common- if the suspected offenders even made it into the jailhouse alive. Some who study the phenomenon of lynching postulate that the practice became common around the turn of the century in the South because of weak social institutions, weak civic institutions, and ineffective law enforcement. They say that all these factors failed to develop sufficiently and so failed to instill in their communities a respect for the rule of law. However, we see in this episode a law enforcement agent standing up to the mob effectively, something that probably occurred rarely. Indeed, in many accounts of lynchings, local officers of the law participated or even instigated the incidents. The incident is tempered through with the prediction that the men protected by Sheriff Rogers will surely be convicted anyway.

Indeed, attendants of the People's Party mass meeting in Thomson Friday, December 5, were deeply stirred as Pearson described his wife who requested that she wanted to give something to help Mr. Watson get his rights. Of course, the Mr. Watson whom Pearson's wife referenced in her last moments was none other than Thomas Watson - the darling of the Populist Party in his campaign for reelection to the House of Representatives. Pearson circled the gathered crowd and, recalling his wife's indelible devotion and enthusiasm for Mr. Watson, sought to invigorate the gathered members and inspire them to act likewise. A People's Party Paper correspondent covering the meeting wrote, It stirs very deeply, very, very deeply, when I think of this good old woman, lying in pain and in the awful shadow of death, and yet having her heart so full of zeal in the cause as to make her last act on earth a proof of her devotion to it, and her last message one of cheer to me. Following such an emotional appeal by Pearson, it is difficult to believe someone would be averse to working for such a man as a Mr. Watson and his populist cause, and yet opponents abounded in his reelection campaign.","What became of Joseph Pearson and his quest to fulfill his wife's dying wish is unknown; however, it may be said that his efforts were part-in-parcel of Watson's eventual reelection to the House of Representatives as a Populist in 1892. Not only was Watson one of the founders of Georgia's Populist Party, but he was also a brilliant orator and incredibly charismatic speaker. Both of these traits helped him climb the ranks of the Populist Party as he strove to unite agrarians across class lines and overcome racial divides. Later, he even advocated for the right of African American men to vote - a radical appeal for a Populist to make given the party's traditional base among white farmers. Unfortunately, Watson's early support for and among African Americans like Joseph Pearson soured after the failure of the Populist Party to fuse tickets with the Democrats in the elections of 1896 and 1898. Watson blamed minorities in the South for the Party's failures on the electoral field of battle and thenceforth transformed into a bitter racist. Watson had always harbored intense anti-Semite and anti-Catholic sentiments, but given his early support for African American rights, few could guess that he would eventually call for the reorganization of the Ku Klux Klan. Watson proceeded on to the national political stage as both a vice presidential candidate in 1896 and a presidential candidate in 1904. He failed, however, to receive enough support to elect him on either front. ","When Watson initially formed the Populist Party in Georgia, it appealed primarily to white farmers, due to its emphasis on agricultural protectionism in the South following low cotton prices in previous decades. On a more national level, the Party advocated for issues like free and unlimited coinage of silver, the abolition of national banks, a system of graduated income tax, public ownership of the railroads, steamship lines and telephone and telegraph systems, and direct election of United States Senators. Fierce competition from Democrats - who were still a viable force in the South at the time - demanded that the Populists appeal not only to the white populace in Georgia but also to African American Republicans. This initiative to attract the black vote obviously proved successful in the case of Pearson's deceased wife. Emotional appeals like Pearson's prove the overwhelming success of Watson in reaching out to the African American populace - an incredibly symbolic attempt which struck a strong chord among many and enabled him to claim bi-racial support on agrarian issues."],"display_date":"December 5, 1892","search_date":"1892-12-05","locations":[{"id":1819,"lat":34.426000328,"lng":-83.2423737095,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3094,"title":"Advancement of Health and Sanitation in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-07-23","end_date":"1891-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the city of Norfolk on July 21, 1891, Dr. Morgan Health officer of Norfolk ","County, examined the dairies and livestock in the city.

That evening as the family recovered, the police arrested a black woman name Frances for the crime and planned to try her the next morning. ","Adolphus Sterne described this event in his diary on July 21, 1841. The only information Sterne gave about Frances was that she was a negro woman. This presumably meant that Frances was one of the Hyde family's household slaves, possibly a cook since she had access to their coffee. Frances's method of murder is significant as Joshua D. Rothman explains: In most cases, women were physically weaker than their owners. When they wished to harm a master or his family, arson or poisoning were more typical weapons of choice. True to Rothman's statement, Frances used poison as a way to injure her master and his family. Her physical limitations as a woman and the ease of obtaining poison and administering it made poisoning her preferred weapon. ","That their own household slave tried to murder them no doubt came as a shock to the Hyde family, and indeed upset many other white families in the area. When slaves rose up against their masters, regardless of the context in which they did so, they implicitly threatened all masters and all whites, observes Rothman. Frances's attempt set a dangerous precedent. If a slave woman could almost murder a family, what could a slave man, or worse a band of slave men do? Episodes like this created feelings of fear and distrust in the minds of slave owners. It also opened the way for other such crimes on the part of slaves. Thus the people had to act quickly on this matter. They planned to try Frances the very next day because they needed to show that they would not tolerate such undermining of a master's authority.

Overall, however, every southern state had a growth in the church population, with women constituting two-thirds of that population. Like African Americans, women were able to find leadership positions in the church that were unavailable to them elsewhere. African American churches during the era focused on the common interest and solidarity that linked the freedmen, and white women focused on these traits within the church as well. The fact that a southern woman like the grandmother used religious language to try and comfort her granddaughter shows how southern women were able to find strength in the church.","The grandmother also talked about the positive influence schooling had on the family's children, which was an aspect of southern education that would not be seen only five years later after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The children probably attended a public school because there were only two parochial schools in all of Arkansas by 1877.

Evans claimed that he would allow each customer to have the leg fitted and test it as much as he or she desired before they had to pay. "," One of the most common injuries of soldiers throughout the Civil War were to their limbs. The use of various large-caliber guns that fired at low velocities resulted in the balls and bullets to break bones or become stuck inside a soldier's body instead of going through it. The low amount of sanitation and generally unhealthy conditions in the hospitals at which the soldiers were brought contributed to infection in their wounds. Also, the Civil War surgeons were often overwhelmed with patients and amputation was usually the only operation they could perform. Roughly 75 percent of all operations done during the war were amputations. However, amputations were did not always result in success. Around 26 percent of the amputees died during or after the surgery. "," This high rate of amputated limbs naturally increased the demand for artificial limbs. At the same time, economic problems during Reconstruction hindered the state's ability to help fund programs to provide the amputated veterans with the much-needed limbs. However, some states were able to contribute some amounts of money to the growing market. Inventors began to patent various types of artificial limbs during and after the war.

White criminals faced one set of rules while blacks faced another. Southern justice did not favor the death penalty unless the accused was black, in which case there was hardly a hesitation in its authorization. On March 15, 1884 in Jonesville, Virginia, Absalom Russell, a white man, was hanged for the murder of Ira Dean. The murder took place two years prior in July of 1882. After the initial guilty verdict, the case traveled through several courts where the guilty verdict was never overturned. Surprisingly, the newspaper points out that the execution of Russell was the first in Lee County since a man was hung for murdering a police officer sixty-seven years before. ","Justice meant different things to different races. Russell, due to his race, was able to have his case heard several times in appeals courts before he was finally hung. The difference in the treatment of blacks and whites in the court room is clear. From 1800-1860, whites were hung in Virginia only for the crime of murder. Half of the blacks that faced the death penalty during that same time period were murderers. Black rapists, burglars, and arsonists were all hung from 1800-1860 in Virginia. This is true in many of the southern states during the nineteenth century. Absalom Russell was able to have his case heard in several courts before finally being hung, while a black man guilty of stealing faced the noose immediately. ","After the Civil War, when treating blacks as property was no longer allowed, many southern states gave their all-white juries the ability to hand down capital punishments. Thus, these states were able to ensure that blacks faced the death penalty far more often than whites. Many blacks did not have the opportunity to face these juries due to the sudden rise in lynchings that took place during Reconstruction. Those responsible for the lynching hardly ever faced repercussions in the court room. The hanging of Absalom Russell was front page news in Wytheville.

In 1870, Ella Painter wrote her Aunt Lena many letters from Dublin, Virginia, with updates and inquiries about Lena's new husband and children. On her fourteenth birthday, Ella wrote her Aunt a lengthy letter which she felt was long overdue. Ella's love and admiration for her Aunt is clear as she nearly begs her to come back and visit. She writes about her recent visitors, her grandfathers new farm, and all of the new additions to the family. The startling aspect of the letter however, is the news of the many close acquaintances living in Dublin who had contracted serious illnesses. Lizzie Cecil had contracted Consumption (Tuberculosis), Ann Martin had Rheumatism, and Julia Jackson had been ill with Typhoid fever. Ella had found out that Dr. Stearns believed Miss Jackson would die, and while she seemed to be doing better, he still believed she could terminate in Consumption. ","Each summer, towns like Dublin saw their cemeteries, dotted with graves of upper-class youth who were victim of disease. Diseases did not discriminate. Death rates in the South remained higher than that of the North for much of the nineteenth century. Without formal vaccines, southerners turned to their own forms of medicine. ","When typhoid fever was believed to be caused by soured tree stumps giving off toxic vapors, entire forests were burned. Someone who had come down with typhoid, or the slow fever, would be treated through sweating, purging, and puking. A more adventurous remedy involved cutting a chicken in half and placing each half on the soles of the feet in order to pull the fever out. ","Rheumatism describes a form of arthritis and other muscle discomforts. For this, Appalachians had more unique remedies. Rattlesnake or red worm oil was sometimes rubbed into the ailing area. Some believed that bee stings would bring relief and advised sufferers to disturb a bee's nest and allow themselves to be stung until it was unbearable. ","Very little could be done for those with consumption. Some slept with ice packs containing their own coughed-up blood on their chests, while others were told to inhale the fumes of a skunk that was placed loose in their room. These remedies most likely did very little to stop the onset of death. It would not be until 1929 that the death rates in Virginia would reach the low of eleven deaths per thousand people.

Most of the people who expired were victims of the same mysterious affliction: high fever, muscle aches, vomiting and an eventual yellowish tint to the skin that preceded death. Baffled physicians prescribed everything from doses of quinine to sponge-baths to calomel, with no telling what the results would be from patient to patient. After a hiatus period, the summer of 1853 was particularly bad for the city, with thousands upon thousands succumbing to this sickness. One Dr. J. S. M'Farlane expressed regret that the city had become complacent and fallen under the impression that the hygienic condition of our city would be meliorated to such an unparalleled degree, that yellow fever and cholera were to fly shrieking to India and Rio Janeiro... Things were so bad that the city published a pamphlet entitled The Epidemic Summer: List of Interments in all the Cemeteries of New Orleans, which, because of the staggering death toll, was in actuality the size of a slender book."," By 1853, a multitude of opinions regarding the fever existed in the medical field. Dr. M'Farlane composed the pamphlet's opening remarks, and made summarizing statements that included his thoughts: he did not believe that yellow fever was contagious, nor that quarantine regulations would effectively prevent the disease. His printed words expressed a rising conviction that yellow fever would have to be combated differently than the typical epidemic disease. Dr. M'Farlane's careful word choice, most noticeable in his presentation of these statements as opinions, still points towards a hesitation to categorize anything about this disease as absolute truth.; however, the fact that this was a city publication indicates that reasoning like his was beginning to gain some credibility. If the city was willing to support his claims by publishing them, those same claims must have been achieving more and more popularity."," As it still stood, popular opinion claimed that, since the freshest faces in New Orleans were most susceptible to yellow fever, it could also be referred to as the Stranger's Disease. The Epidemic Summer itself perpetuates this belief: of the 67 pages of small print filled with names of the dead, a significant number of them are shown to be immigrants; most often from Ireland or Germany. This common belief perpetuated stereotypes against these newcomers. Although in reality the city suffered from bouts of yellow fever because of its high volume of traffic with mosquito-ridden Latin America, the stratification of its victims played into the existing prejudices towards ethnicities and classes."],"display_date":"May 1, 1853 - November 1, 1853","search_date":"1853-08-01","locations":[{"id":5598,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3176,"title":"Livestock and Appalachia   \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-04-03","end_date":"1884-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Healthy livestock were imperative to running a successful farm in Appalachia.

Responsible for improving the livestock population, Bob Crockett was a local hero. Before the war, cattle fever, or glanders, was nearly non-existent in Virginia. As the livestock in North Carolina, Georgia and other southern states became sick prior to the war, Virginians made sure their cattle had no contact with them. When the war began and livestock grew scarce, Confederate soldiers demanded cattle be brought to them in Virginia. Thus, after forty years of no disease, cattle fever became rampant in Virginia by 1865. Other southerners blamed the disease on northern soldiers who purposely left their diseased horses on southern land, spreading the glanders disease. Soon southern farmers were faced not only with cattle fever but also an equine influenza that would do even more damage. ","The Civil War destroyed the southern landscape. Railroad tracks were torn up, farm land became infertile, and disease was everywhere. The livestock epidemic that ravaged Virginia only made things more impossible. High cattle losses meant farmers had very little homemade fertilizer. Low supplies of fertilizer made farming and recovery nearly impossible.

The city had lost a respected citizen and a leading businessman, regarded as one of the South's best railroad men. Gittio, thinking he had a cold, had called upon a doctor who discovered pronounced heart trouble and, to the shock of the region, he died a few days later. Gittio embodied a rags to riches story, as he started his work on the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad in 1854 as a sixteen year old boy. He would eventually work his way up to becoming superintendent of the line, and he would exert great influence in all the railroads that stretched out from the Norfolk region. Despite his personal high standing, the Norfolk paper explained, He took great pride in the advancement and the prosperity of his native city. As his wife and young boy looked on in grief, Gittio's pall-bearers, railroad men themselves, laid the forty eight year old to rest. "," Evident in the high respect afforded Capt Gittio, railroads would develop a special meaning to the postwar South, as they embodied forward progress and development. At the outset of Reconstruction, the South's prosperity lagged far behind that of the rest of the country, and people hoped railroad construction would revitalize the Southern economy. Due to political mishandling, railroad construction during Reconstruction hardly existed, but thereafter until the turn of the century, the South would build railroads faster than any part of the country. Utilizing mostly Northern capital, Southern railroad mileage increased from 16,605 miles in 1880 to 39,103 miles in 1890. Soon, 90 percent of Southerners would live in a county with railroads. In big Southern cities railroad consolidation and expansion would lead to the creation of a central downtown station, from which a vibrant business district would grow. Such improved access to this reliable, quicker means of transportation revolutionized the way business was conducted, evidenced in the boom of mass production and mass distribution during this era. "," Despite the aura that encompassed them, Southern railroads, like the one Gittio managed, did not always bring prosperity and happiness. Oftentimes railroads and railroad construction could be linked to corrupt ties with political parties, especially evident in Virginia's case. Economically, though railroads lowered transportation costs for businesses, their rates often seemed oppressive to farmers trying to ship their crops, leading to populist calls for rate regulation and government commissions. Socially, they became center stage for the separate but equal theory that would eventually manifest itself into outright segregation. Nonetheless, new railways seemed to bring new opportunities for many of those along the line, and for these reasons the Portsmouth community chose to remember Capt. Gittio and his career so gratefully.

Roland left New York on the steam-packet <em>Home</em> bound for Charleston. His trip quickly took a turn for the worst. By Monday morning, the ship encountered a violent hurricane in the waters around Cape Hatteras and was taking on water. All hands were at the pumps, women included, bailing out water, but the leak continued to increase. After water reached the engine, Captain Carleton White decided to beach the vessel in order to save the passengers and crew on board. At around ten o'clock in the evening, the Home struck the outer breakers a quarter mile from the shore. Roland reported, In an instant after the strike, all was utter confusion and alarm. Men, women and children screamed in the most agonizing manner, fearful of the almost certain death that lay before them. Amid all the chaos, Mr. Roland shed all his clothes except for his shirt and pantaloons and dived into the turbulent waters. Somehow, he managed to escape death and made it to the shore - though the current had swept him a mile and a half to the south. ","Roland recalled how the scene the next morning was too horrid to describe. The engine and the boiler being the only unbroken relics of what was the beautiful packet <em>Home</em>. The shore was lined with bodies constantly coming up. All hands were engaged in collecting them together. In a letter to the owners of the <em>Home</em>, Captain White estimated the death toll at around 80 souls. After the catastrophe, Roland returned to New York and told his story. ","Steam vessels like the <em>Home</em> always passed through the sea lanes off the Outer Banks. It was not uncommon for vacationers there to see as many as half a dozen vessels off the shore. The navigation of these sea routes enabled better access to local and national markets, fueling the economic development of North Carolina in the 1840s and 1850s. But how did the South respond to the maritime disaster of the Home? First, questions were raised about the safety of these steam-packets that were designed for luxury more than performance, in order to compete with railroad travel. Southerners looked to the steam vessels of Britain for engineering standards. A more illuminating response was the consideration of religion. One Reverend, clinging to a piece of luggage, was heard to utter these words in the frigid waters of the Outer Banks: He that trusts in Jesus is safe, even in the perils of the sea. If there was one thing common to Southern society, it was that most people found ultimate solace in religion. After the shipwreck, it was the only way to make sense of the destruction. Accordingly, Reverends throughout the area consoled their congregations, reminding them of God's divine plan even in the face of such a catastrophe."],"display_date":"October 10, 1847 - December 31, 1847","search_date":"1847-11-19","locations":[{"id":9397,"lat":35.8842931253,"lng":-75.6026917115,"zoom":8,"place":"CURRITUCK, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3280,"title":"African American Lynched During Prison Transfer\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-05-08","end_date":"1883-05-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 8, 1883, a Texan was arrested at the ferry landing in Shreveport, Louisiana for the murder of William H. Lyon. The Texan's name was D.C. Hutchins, and he was an African American. The paper described Hutchins as a desperado and noted that he had been a terror to the decent citizens of Bossier parish, La. The citizens of Bossier parish were indignant at the crime. The paper also noted with no surprise that they created a plan to capture Hutchins when he was being transferred between prisons at Shreveport and Bellevue in order to perform their own justice with the criminal. The transfer was to take place on May 12 through 13 and the group that conducted the prison transfer consisted of two deputy sheriffs and a group of 12 citizens including the Chief of Police, E.M. Austin. Hutchins rode in a wagon with one of the citizens, Chas. A. Dewing. Everyone except Hutchins was armed. The group met 75-100 masked men about four miles from town. When Hutchins saw them he tried to get Dewing's pistol, but Dewing kept it from him as Austin, the Chief of Police, put himself in between the wagon and the crowd. Austin attempted to get the crowd to lower their guns, while Hutchins begged the crowd to shoot him. The crowd refused both Austin's and Hutchins' requests, and yelled back their intention to hang Hutchins. With this threat Hutchins pulled a four-inch blade from his pocket and began to stab himself to try and save himself from hanging. Austin and Dewing got the knife away from Hutchins and the crowd took Hutchins, who had begun to lose large quantities of blood, away from the wagon and to a nearby tree. The crowd hung Hutchins from the tree, even though he was already dying from his self-inflicted wounds.","The most telling part of this episode is the opening line of the article: The lynching of D.C. Hutchins...was accompanied with more than the usual dramatic surroundings of such events. This article, which was published in a national newspaper, used the word usual to describe the death of an African American without trial. Lynchings became increasingly popular in the cotton uplands, and especially in rural places such as Bossier Parish. Counties or parishes with few towns, low rural population density, and poor law enforcement had high rates of lynching, especially as the African American population increased. The lynching of African Americans reached its highest point when new African Americans came to the uplands and were strangers to the community. Men like Hutchins had no one within the community to support them, allowing reputations as desperados to spring up. These reputations were also due to the white belief that African American crime was out of control and a serious threat. The paper describes Hutchins as a villain, while portraying the lynching mob as the decent citizens of Bossier parish. This description in a national paper cements the severe racism that grew in this era."],"display_date":"May 8, 1883 - May 13, 1883","search_date":"1883-05-10","locations":[{"id":5453,"lat":32.5800672889,"lng":-93.88223782,"zoom":9,"place":"CADDO, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3285,"title":"Hawkins, the Horse Thief","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-02-29","end_date":"1848-02-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Thursday, February 29, 1849, The Valley Star of Lexington, Virginia reported that the infamous horse thief, Hawkins, while in jail, slit his own throat with a straight razor. The guards allowed the inmates razors and stood outside the cells as the prisoners shaved. According to the article, Hawkins turned to the guard, said, Good-bye, and promptly slit his throat. Being near at hand, we ran to see him. He presented a shocking aspect. The blood was spouting rapidly from the horrid gash in his neck, and the bed on which he lay near his head and neck was all saturated with the purple current. A doctor soon arrived and determined that Hawkins had missed the primary artery and would survive.","The same edition of this paper describes Hawkins' escape from his jail in Harrisonburg, Virginia. For much of the time before his recapture, Hawkins was five miles from the jail. He then went to his family in Dayton, where he hid beneath the bed and passed his time knitting socks, which his wife subsequently sold to neighbors. After some time he gathered his family, stole what was believed to be three or four horses, and set out for the west. Authorities recaptured him on the road and sent him back to jail, where he subsequently attempted suicide. ","Hawkins' public escape and recapture brought the prison system into the public eye. One cannot be sure if it was the condition of the prison that provoked him to attempt suicide, or whether he was just a desperate. However, life was difficult for a convict in a penitentiary in Virginia. Labor occupied most of a prisoner's time. Much more so than today, states used penitentiaries to make a profit. In fact, some men bought or leased prisons and then worked their prisoners to death (The lessees worked them quite literally to death in many cases; the mortality rate ranged from 17-40 percent). Leasing became popular in the South, after the war especially, when states could not afford to keep up the prisons. ","As Edward Ayers states in <em>Vengeance and Justice: Crime and Punishment in the 19th-Century American South</em>, the system of slavery in the ante-bellum South kept much of the lower class under control. Because of southern ideals of honor, it seems that there would be less of a need of a prison system; nonetheless, the South built as many prisons as the North (with the exception of Florida and the Carolinas). The South spent much of the time preceding the war to debate whether or not the penitentiary was in fact in line with the American ideals of liberty. Ironically, unlike the North, their lowest class was already imprisoned within society.",">In 1796, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where the penitentiary started, were the only states that attempted to reduce deaths by capital punishment. At that time, the only offense that warranted it was murder. Punishment varied in every region in the country: the penitentiary system in the West was very different. On November 14th, 1856, James R. Whitehead wrote a letter from the Kansas Territory to his cousin Langhan Scruggs, who lived in the Valley of Virginia. In an earlier letter (September 11th), he had described to great detail the sort of men that were settled in the West; northern and southern relations were mirrored in Kansas. The young men were belligerent and chivalrous, always ready to fight. In Whitehead's mind, the West needed new kinds of settlers. In the letter on November 14th, Whitehead wrote about crime and punishment in the territory. More than three hundred Bills of Indictment had been filed, twenty of which were manslaughter. The punishment was far from death; the men found guilty served five years of confinement and hard labor."],"display_date":"February 29, 1848","search_date":"1848-02-29","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3298,"title":"The Peculiarity of William Knoth&#39;s Insanity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-09-14","end_date":"1853-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Knoth, an inmate of the Insane Asylum located in Augusta County, Virginia, escaped the facility and fled to Canada. He was described as being in a deranged state prior to his flight. Knoth had believed that the people of Augusta were hostile towards him because he was prejudiced against slavery. This is assumed to be the reason why he left for Canada. In addition, the inmate took with him 300, which he wasted away. ","After receiving the unfortunate news, Knoth's family became very disturbed at the peculiar direction their loved one's insanity led him. They spread word of his escape and their desire to have him brought back to them. Is Knoth's behavior really that peculiar? Historian Edward L. Ayers would probably disagree with this characterization of Knoth's behavior. In his work, <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</em>, Ayers places slavery at the heart of Augusta County's economy. He notes that in the 1850's over sixteen hundred white households owned fifty-five hundred slaves within the county. With this newly gained knowledge Knoth's actions; that previously seemed rash and contingent with his insanity; now appear rational. Ayers further ascertains that slavery stood as a fundamental fact in Augusta County. In fact, its roots dug even deeper into the heart of the county when slave prices inflated dramatically in the 1850s. This inflation reassured Southerners that slaves were a good investment, and further intensified their desire to protect the institution that accounted for their prosperity from the growing threats that were prevalent in the years leading up to the Civil War. It is no wonder why Knoth, though insane, was able to recognize and fear the hostility that Augusta citizens felt towards abolitionists, and those who harbored abolitionist beliefs."],"display_date":"September 14, 1853","search_date":"1853-09-14","locations":[{"id":13638,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3299,"title":"Illness Creates Need for Help within Rambin Household\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-02-12","end_date":"1871-02-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sally Young Rambin's letter to her sister opened with an apology for her long silence and an excuse: Rambin had been extremely sick and had only been able to get out of bed for two weeks before she attempted to write to her sister on February 12, 1871.

Rambin told her sister that the doctor could not or was afraid on account of my situation to give me the necessary medicine. Rambin had recently had a baby, and her husband blamed her illness on her nursing the child for too long. Rambin's illness created a need for additional help to keep the Rambins' household in De Soto, Louisiana running.

During the postbellum period, the Rambins' no longer relied on slave labor to run their household, but they did remain dependent on the African American work force.

This was not the case in the 1800's. Appearing in The Valley Star each week was a selected tale, including topics ranging from a loveless marriage to an alcoholic father. Though the language is not quite timeless, the themes certainly are, and are as relevant today as they were then.","The Lonely Wife follows Susan Morris and her daily life and loveless marriage. In the majority of her four-year marriage, she has been left at home with her son while her husband is either working or drinking. She begs him to spend time with her, but in his mind, giving her money and responsibility to run the house is enough. As time goes by, Susan is so worn by her inner demons that her physical appearance changes and she begins to encounter medical problems, but the doctor only suggests that she go to her prior home and spend time in the country. Her countenance cannot allow her to tell her husband the real reason she is so ill, so she gradually drifts away, knowing that she is not strong enough to save herself. ","The Temperance Cause was a story submitted by the American Temperance Recorder in an attempt to advertise for the temperance movement. Mary Edwards is a young woman who lives alone with her father. Ever since her mother died, her father has grown less and less responsible; he lost his job, his house, and now he spends most of his time drinking. One night, when he arrives at his local bar, there is a temperance movement speaker causing a raucous. With much encouragement, the stranger stands on a table and begins to sings. A sweet song comes from his lips about all that he lost when he started drinking. The father is so touched by the music that he rushes home to his daughter and vows to turn his life around. This story appeared in the paper in the hope that one could see the power of music and of stories and would take initiative to change his lot in life.","The newspaper showed the effects of heavy drinking through these two stories and warned its readers against following this path. In the antebellum South, and in Virginia in particular, many prominent men were involved in the temperance movement, including John Hartwell Cocke. Cocke was a good friend of Thomas Jefferson's and a supporter of the University of Virginia. The movement started mainly in Protestant churches. The M.E.

By the next day he was dead. ","The relationship between slave and owner teetered on a precarious balance. On one hand slaveholders reveled in their slaves' dependence and love for them. According to Raymond and Alice Bauer, masters saw their slaves' smiling, bowing, and scraping as evidence of their happiness, docility, and acceptance as part of an inferior race. On the other hand, slaves frustrated their masters with feigned illness and pregnancy, broken tools, and running away for short stints to avoid work. This laziness was punished through whippings and other humiliating practices. Slaves resisted day to day in these subtle ways, confusing and provoking their masters. ","Physical slave violence and insurrection were much rarer than these more passive forms of resistance. Attacks like the one against Mrs. Smith did not occur frequently. Melvin Ely writes that the wake of Nat Turner's rebellion in Virginia in 1831 revealed not a militarized culture of bold, well-armed, dead-eye marksmen born on horseback, but rather a land of frightened, often befuddled white men milling around in ragtag militia musters. They were unprepared for a slave revolt, and were often without the proper supplies to put down an attack should it happen. They feared and prepared for it the way a group of people fear and prepare for a natural disaster, like a volcano which has lain dormant for a hundred years. They had a plan but it was not an immediate concern, just uneasiness lurking in the back of their minds.","Attacks like the one that occurred on that hot July day showed up in newspapers occasionally. At moments like that, deep seeded fears bubbled briefly to the surface and made slaveowners, but also whites everywhere, question just how obedient and satisfied slaves were with their place in American society.

On that day, the coroner of Arkansas County held a formal inquest into the death of William Mabbet who had been found near Hickory Point. Curiously, Mabbet's body appeared heavily bruised and beaten, but showed no signs of resistance. If he had been attacked, should there not be some evidence of a struggle?","Violent deaths, like William Mabbet's, were not particularly unusual on the frontier. States and territories throughout the South passed statutes in an attempt to limit the number of concealed weapons a man might carry, but they were careful to specify that these weapons could and should be used in self defense. An important distinction lies in the fact that while such laws were passed, violent brawls and murders still occurred, enough to give the state of Arkansas a reputation as a dangerous place. ","This was due in part to the fact that the territorial government focused most of their attention on organizing new counties and petitioning Congress. The territorial government passed very little legislation concerning anything other than these matters within the first year of its creation and federal troops were often heavily engaged in maintaining borders with the Cherokee, Choctaws, Osages, Quapaws, and other Native American groups within and just outside the new territory. Local courts dealt with justice and, at times, formal proceedings were withheld entirely. As late as 1843, German traveler Friedrich Gerstacker witnessed a shocking account of a horse thief tied to a tree and beaten without a trial. ","The inquest into William Mabbet's death probably took the form of similar proceedings observed by Gerstacker. The court was typically held in a nearby postmaster's home, the jury was made up of neighboring landowners, and a lawyer journeyed to the local town from Little Rock to act as judge. At the end of the hearing, the jury would go outside to a porch or stable to deliberate. But luckily for the people of Arkansas County, the outcome of this particular inquest revealed that their lives were not in danger from some particularly violent drifter or vengeful Indian tribe; just a horse that had trampled his owner while the latter slept in the grass near Hickory Point."],"display_date":"January 22, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-22","locations":[{"id":449,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ARKANSAS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3341,"title":"A Trying Voyage\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-01-27","end_date":"1829-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sunday morning, January 27, 1829... a joyful thankfulness filled our hearts, for we were entering the land of promise. Mary Wightman Helm had good reason to rejoice after a most difficult journey to Texas. Helm related that the trip usually took a bearable seven days, but left without a breeze in the unpredictable Gulf of Mexico, her voyage took an astonishing 31 days. The ship only carried provisions for the expected seven days and was insufficiently stocked with water. It is no surprise that under these conditions Helm fell ill. She related, after our cooked provisions had given out, crackers and hard sea bread sustained life; but when the water gave out, then real suffering commenced. ","Helm had already survived extensive travels before she boarded the Little Zoe, the schooner that took her and her husband Elias R. Wightman to Texas. The couple departed Herkimer County, New York in 1828 and set out upon a popular route to the West. They traveled by boat down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the boarded a steamboat bound for New Orleans by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. At New Orleans, the Helms embarked upon their troubled cruise on the Little Zoe. At the time, such schooners were the primary means of travel between New Orleans and Texas because their shallow bottoms were less likely to hit the sandbars that existed along the coast of Texas. The small ships, however, were subject to the fickle weather of the Gulf of Mexico. ","Though the Helms found their voyage particularly unpleasant, it pales in comparison to the horrific passage of slaves brought from Africa to the American South. The South's economy created a great demand for slaves that fueled the trans-Atlantic slave trade even after it became illegal in America in 1808. Like Mary Helm, enslaved Africans faced hunger and sickness but also bore the added burden of generally inhumane conditions on the journey to America. Sources describe the system of transportation as gruesome and ruthlessly efficient. Such factors as malnutrition... and deprivation of sunlight from prolonged stays below deck made illness and high death rates unavoidable. And though the trade was outlawed by the United States in 1808, the illegal trade that continued through portals such as Texas brought about unprecedented horrors for captured Africans. Though most of the slaves in Texas were brought from the United States an illegal [trans-Atlantic] slave trade developed as early as 1835. The injustices that took place on slave ships occurred on the seas rather than American soil, but the blood shed on such vessels belonged on the plantations of the South. The demand for slaves created by Texas and the other Southern states led directly to the brutalities against Africans. As one source summarizes, Without the demand for slaves, there would have been no transatlantic slave trade... no illegal piracy along the coast-but, most of all, none of the terror and degradation suffered by slaves on their journey from the coast of Africa to the Americas."],"display_date":"January 27, 1829","search_date":"1829-01-27","locations":[{"id":15201,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3343,"title":"Contraception of the 1840&#39;s and 1850&#39;s\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["NEW EDITION OF DR WEISSELHOFF'S SCIENTIFIC WORK ON THE SUBJECT OF CHILD-BIRTH screamed an ad in Lexington's The Valley Star.

At first glance, it is not even completely clear what the product is: It will be found of special value to those whose means, health or other circumstances, do not permit them to increase the number of their family, without great inconvenience, suffering, or perhaps risk of life.","In Contraception and Abortion in Nineteenth-Century America, Janet Brodie describes causes for the decline in white fertility in the Nineteenth Century.

Carter Williams, a Norfolk resident, visible at the front of the Confederate line at Chancellorsville, led a most daring charge, the battle's first day, into the teeth of federal infantry and their cannons. The 6 Virginia captured the Union color bearer and seized the guns, resulting in Robert E. Lee, himself, personally thanking the brave Capt Williams the next morning. Soon after receiving such a high honor, Carter fell in battle, becoming one of many left strewn across the field that bloody day. "," On June 18, 1884, Capt. James Barron Hope asked those assembled from Pickett-Buchanan Camp of ex-Confederates and from the city of Norfolk to remember the sacrifices of fellow soldiers. He spoke of warriors like Capt. Williams, who never returned and whose resting spots constituted Virginia's most precious jewels. All those assembled witnessed the dedication of a Confederate memorial to honor the memory of fallen veterans and the Cause, though lost a cause which our brothers believed was right and which we believe is right today. After a solemn procession and readings of poems heavily laced with heroic imagery, the audience gathered as Confederates and declared each 18 of June a memorial day to those they would never forget. "," Southern romanticism with the Lost Cause and the Confederacy grew along with the increasing manifestation of a New South towards the end of the nineteenth century. The South suffered from a prevailing sense of inferiority and a constant need for justifying such a position, and the years of Southern reconciliation witnessed the peak in this cult of the Confederacy. The older generation recoiled as the younger generation embraced Yankee values and forgot or misunderstood what the veterans had fought for. Thus, the former Confederates felt compelled to make their offspring remember a society they saw evaporating before their eyes. By 1896, 75 percent of former Confederate counties had United Confederate Veterans groups, representing a third of the ex-southern soldiers still living. For similar reasons, women formed the Daughters of the Confederacy, which sought to raise money for building monuments, like the one in Norfolk, to make this past permanent. One of the biggest celebrations occurred in Richmond, where in 1890 100,000 people gathered to raise the Robert E. Lee monument. "," Ironically, some advocates pushing towards a New South, sought out Confederate imagery to help legitimize their projects. Railroads, oftentimes, would locate an impoverished, old Confederate general, and put his name on their letter-head as effective advertising. Even a new style of American literature played a key role in reassembling the values and virtues of the fabled Southern aristocracy. Fiction became distinctively Confederate in sympathy in a way that had not even existed in the ante-bellum South's defense of its peculiar practices. Northern authors even carried this theme. Likewise, one saw an increase in genealogy, as people tried to connect themselves to these lost heroes of the past. Eventually, those groups using Lost Cause imagery to profit no longer needed it, while those who truly embodied it gradually died off. Though perhaps diminishing in numbers, this undercurrent of Confederate nostalgia (especially seen in race relations) would remain into the twentieth century.

Another round of shots rang out, and the boys were excited even more. As they approached the area, the men hurried into their respective carriages and drove off. On the bank of the canal, lying next to the woods, the boys saw a man with a red handkerchief lying over his face. Wilkins and the boys hurried off to his uncle's to tell him of the dead man in the woods.","The man with the red handkerchief over his face was H.F. Harris; the man responsible for his death was E.C. Yellowly. They were both lawyers of the Greenville bar in Pitt County, North Carolina. During one particular court case, Harris had criticized Yellowly's legal proceedings; Yellowly had responded with harsh criticism of his own. After court, Harris and Yellowly had an altercation that was subdued by friends in the area. Harris challenged Yellowly to a duel, and the challenge was accepted. However, both were arrested and put under heavy bonds to prevent the violence for one year. On the very day the bond was out, Harris renewed the challenge, and it was again accepted. On October 1, 1847, the two rivals met on the Dismal Swamp Canal. Yellowly attempted reconciliation before the duel, but Harris refused. Even as Harris fired his first round, Yellowly shot his pistol in the air, again attempting to make peace. Yet, Harris remained firm and fired another shot that went wild. This time around, Yellowly's ball hit its mark, striking Harris in the forehead, just above his right eyebrow. Seeing Harris fall, Yellowly commanded his second, Go to him, for God's sake, for I don't want to kill him.","Dueling was a common ritual of antebellum Southern life. Southern gentlemen lived by a strong code of honor, and dueling was virtually accepted as a proper way to defend one's honor. In <em>Honor and Slavery</em>, Kenneth S. Greenberg observed how men feared that to refuse a duel was to become a social outcast. The stakes were that high. Accordingly, many men achieved great political success after duels, and among the wealthy classes, most men got off scot-free from their crimes. E.C. Yellowly was no exception: he was arrested in Virginia where the Magistrate let him go. Many historians have used the accounts of duels to illustrate how the South as a whole was an Honor society.

On the morning of the shooting, Wilcox entered the saloon in which Miller was seated. When he received no compensation upon demand of the money, he fatally shot Miller. Wilcox immediately escaped to the Fork Deer bottom, where he was pursued by the Sheriff and his men.","In the South, this kind of violence was an ordinary occurrence as many people opted to take justice into their own hands rather than leave it to the authorities. Historian C. Vann Woodward says The South seems to have been one of the most violent communities of comparable size in all Christendom. This kind of violence in the post- Civil War American South was extremely prevalent, as homicides alone sometimes doubled and tripled the number of such deaths prior to the War. Old census reports exist, however prove unreliable because the reports usually fell far short of the number of actual homicides. ","Freedmen such as Miller appeared in newspapers often for violent offenses as did others, but usually situations involving them were labeled colored. This significance allowed the majority of the newspapers' intended readers, white society, to understand what African Americans were capable of. ","However distinct the reports of incidents such as the shooting between Miller and Wilcox became towards black men, violence of the South in general could not have been attributed to only African Americans because in several southern states white men were killed much more often in proportion to their own population. Southern newspapers of the day were often crowded with homicides between professionals such as lawyers, planters, railroad presidents, doctors, preachers, and editors. The cause for many of these homicides were usually trivial, but were influenced by the phenomena of how carrying a pistol became normal for many Southerners.

The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3475,"title":"Traveling Epidemics Affected People in all areas of the Country\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-08-13","end_date":"1818-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As a public warning, lists of certain items that had serious potential of making one sick were often created and published in newspapers to inform the community. A Mississippi paper proclaimed that anybody who sold offer[ed] or expos[ed] any tainted, putrid or unwholesome fish or flesh, or the flesh of any animal dieing otherwise than by slaughter; or slaughtered when diseased for the purpose of being sold or offered for sale was breaking the law. Along with this warning of what not to eat, the paper informed the public that people who disobeyed these rules would be forced to pay a fine of five dollars. Provisional laws were given serious thought in regards to what people should be allowed to eat or sell with the intent of reducing the possibility of transmitting infection among the inhabitants of different communities.","Diseases were frequently established and spread by the consumption of poor food, infection, or contacting others who had contagious viruses. As trading increased and people began traveling around the world, new illnesses were found and exposed to people wherever these ships landed. In a conversation between William and John Bisland they discussed how the yellow fever began at New Orleans, and came up to Natchez by the Steam Boat, killing a great number of people. Due to the fear of contracting these unknown diseases states elected a member of their community to establish a board of health. The board of health in Mississippi was extremely concerned with the welfare of their citizens and established preventative measures to avoid the contraction of diseases, to help reduce the number of people exposed to sicknesses and determine rules regarding the presence of foreigners on their land. Incidences such as this one forced Mississippi to determine laws which were immediately enforced and stating that all empty or other boats landing [in this city], shall immediately notify the health officer and that the boats needed to immediately be cleansed, sent adrift or removed. If the possessor of a boat did not comply with the officers request, the owner of such flat or other boats [were considered] guilty of a misdemeanor and were subject to appropriate prosecution. ","Healthcare was a considerable problem in nineteenth century Mississippi because of the little knowledge communities had regarding specific diseases and the shortage of medicines needed to treat these widespread illnesses. Life became much easier for families when the creation of home medical guides were established in the late 1820's. These books were designed to serve as a guide for frontier and rural families who lived great distances from primitive medical care (McClary) so maintaining health would not require the attention of a physician. If any problems or sicknesses were identified, families could easily treat them without traveling to a major city. Books such as this one were easy helpful way to cure uncommon yet simple diseases. Establishing different methods of battling sickness was a crucial issue in the United States in order to prevent any devastating epidemics."],"display_date":"August 13, 1817 - March 3, 1818","search_date":"1817-11-21","locations":[{"id":7334,"lat":31.1620370957,"lng":-91.3093142159,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3497,"title":"Folk and Quack Medicine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-08-20","end_date":"1817-08-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Doctor Robertson had done it, and he had done it for western Virginia's Charlestown in 1817. He had discovered the most valuable medicine ever offered to the public (Farmer's Repository), a veritable cure all. Luckily, he was nice enough to share. The local Apothecary's Shop in Charlestown advertised that it would sell the phenomenal set of Doctor Robertson's Family Medicines. One cure was proved by thousands who have experienced its beneficial effects while another was confidently recommended as the most efficacious medicine for the speedy relief and cure of all nervous complaints. They were truly panaceas. The medical professional also offered the public antidotes for fevers and itches as well as infallible worm destroying lozenges. Clients must also have cared about the appearance of their teeth because Doctor Robertson made sure to include toothache drops and a remedy for improving the teeth and gums."," On the small chance that a woman's ailments were not covered by the above medicines, the good doctor offered a solution for all diseases peculiar to the female sex. Doctor Robertson's Vegetable Nervous Cordial, or Nature's Grand Restorative was the ticket out of depression, illness, faintness or any other disease associated with nerves. Such quack medicine gained popularity because there were few good options for southerners. According to John Duffy, Although tremendous strides had been taken in the realm of the basic sciences by the early nineteenth century, the practice of medicine had not kept abreast of the new discoveries. People were hungry for cures for everything from the common cold to the miserable contagious diseases that plagued society, but there was little help to be found."," Southerners also turned to folk medicines as orthodox practices became increasingly extreme. Duffy writes thatThroughout most of the period the average practitioner was prone to excessively bleeding, purging, blistering, and the administration of relatively large quantities of dangerous drugs. There was a great chance that doctors would harm patients more than help them. Faced with such horrific treatment options and unqualified medical help, it is no wonder that a large percentage of the population in the South looked to herbal medicines and folk panaceas."],"display_date":"August 20, 1817","search_date":"1817-08-20","locations":[{"id":14650,"lat":38.3861984314,"lng":-81.3578369854,"zoom":8,"place":"KANAWHA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3512,"title":"Blackburn&#39;s Emancipation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-03-02","end_date":"1835-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["General Samuel Blackburn, a lawyer, general in the militia, prominent and popular resident of Augusta County, died on March 2, 1835. While this would be of note in itself, of special interest is that in his will, according to the <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, General Blackburn liberated his forty slaves on the condition that they would immigrate to Liberia. Their trip was paid by his estate. No mention is made if the slaves reached Liberia, or if his wife, who survived him by five years, liberated the enslaved peoples immediately following his death. The <em>Annals </em>do stress his evangelical Christianity, including an excerpt of his will in which General Blackburn writes,  I die, as I trust, a Christian, believing as I must in the doctrine for the atonement by the death, the suffering and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ..."," General Blackburn was not alone in Augusta County in his desire to send enslaved peoples to Africa. In December of 1831, a petition with the signatures of 28 Augusta men was sent to the Virginia Legislature asking for their support of United States Constitutional amendment which would give the United States Congress the ability to raise and appropriate money to transport free persons of color to the coast of Africa, and also, the power to purchase slaves then transport them likewise."," A belief in slavery was anything but static in the white South. Rather, opinions on thepeculiar institution varied widely. Melvin Ely's <em>Israel on the Appamattox</em>, recounts how slaves from Prince Edward County, Virginia, are set free, given land, and co-exist relatively peacefully with their white neighbors for over forty years. Yet Ely also notes that Blackburn's response, Colonization, was not uncommon among whites with qualms about slavery, although informal surveys taken just after Nat Turner's revolt seemed to show that much of Virginia's enslaved black population had little desire to move from their birthplace to Africa.

Though shutting up the house on a Thursday morning was an unusual step, she had felt indisposed recently and so they thought nothing of it. It was not until the middle of the day, when a serving woman came to ask about dinner, that they realized something was amiss. Nancy Gray was not asleep; she was found in a closet, propped up into a sitting position by the shotgun she had used to kill herself. At her side was a buggy whip, with which she was thought to have pulled the trigger. Her husband, Mr. William M. Gray, was understandably distraught, as he had left her that morning in a seemingly cheerful state and had gone to help a neighbor who was building a new home nearby. ","The Democrat referred to the death as a mysterious suicide because she was young, lovely, but recently married, surrounded by every comfort, and apparently happy. Their only qualification was that, at times she seemed somewhat depressed and their conclusion was that at the moment of the suicide she must have been rendered temporarily insane. ","Ideas about women's mental health were extremely undeveloped at this time, and depression usually went undiagnosed. If identified at all, it was blamed on a variety of factors including idleness, exhaustion, childbearing, not being able to bear children, over-mothering, and the female wardrobe of the 19th century, among others. Though appearing among all classes, middle- and upper- class women were the most vulnerable to depression, possibly due to the relatively few outlets available for the high amount of education they received. But new wives were expected to create a stable and loving home environment for their husbands, and if depression prohibited a woman from doing so, the sense of failure could be overwhelming.","This episode is also symptomatic of the well-established patriarchal male ideas about womanhood in the antebellum South. Women were put on a pedestal, idealized as pure and innocent creatures to be taken care of and carefully worshipped. The fact that this woman was married, pretty and had every material object she desired available to her should have rendered her perfectly happy, and thus crazy to have wanted to kill herself. In Virginia, the heart of the Old South, this paternalistic idea of womanhood was particularly prevalent. Women, however, played a much larger role than the stereotype of the pampered housewife suggests. Most women were not wealthy plantation mistresses, but poor women struggling to raise a family. They had as much work as men in household chores, raising children, often helping with farm work, and all the while expected to be pure, fertile, chaste, and well-mannered. ","There is evidence that women at times felt strangled by this rigid and prescribed role created for them. The isolated nature of much of the rural South in 1856, limited a woman's access to other women, which prevented the creation of an alternative support system. Therefore, most women turned only to their husbands and children as their primary caring relationships. These relationships enforced already close ties to the home. The rise of companionate marriages in the South also helped create a system in which women held more responsibility for creating the ideal happy southern home, and more blame if they could not. Because the husband's sphere was considered to be outside the home, the task of providing a warm, welcoming family environment fell mostly upon the wife and mother in the household. There was little room for depression or mental illness in this idyllic world view and, as divorce was extremely rare and difficult to obtain (requiring a private act of the state congress) suicide could become a last resort.

Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3553,"title":"Obtaining a Pass to Face Suffering Soldiers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-04","end_date":"1861-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["While residing in his hometown of Washington, DC, a Doctor Snyder was summoned by the Head Quarters City Guard to tend to the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac who were currently stationed in Virginia.However, in order to reach the Army in Virginia, where he was to spend four days, he had to first obtain a pass For Civilians from the Provost Marshal's Office in Washington.The pass was of great importance because it affirmed Snyder's loyalty to the Union, despite crossing over into the Confederacy, while it also protected him from the Confederate Army as simply doing his job as a physician and not playing a direct and active role in fighting the Civil War.","The Army of the Potomac was created by Lincoln for the specific role of defending the Capitol.

The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today.

Civilized countries recognized the need of foreign trade to compete in this new arena. Foreign trade required the participation of everyone from government leaders to common citizens. A Florida resident, Cecil H. Alleyne expressed his concern over a Yellow Fever breakout and its effects on the world market. In his letter to the London Times in 1886 Alleyne describes the gravity of the disease in Jacksonville, Florida. ","Without health care systems or emergency rooms, Florida tried to deal with a Yellow Fever epidemic in the late nineteenth century. Subsequently, the disease ravaged parts of Florida including Key West, Manatee, Tampa, and Plant City. In Jacksonville alone by 1888 the disease had claimed 427 lives out of 4,656 reported cases. To try and tame the disease several cities set huge fires of pine and tar in an effort to cleanse contaminated areas. The Jacksonville Sanitary Association managed to raise 350,000 to fight the disease. At every level of government, Florida tried to control Yellow Fever from spreading. The mayor of Jacksonville quarantined areas in an effort to limit the outbreak of disease. Alleyne believed the quarantine and relief efforts that Florida put into effect successfully restricted the disease. One of the more radical approaches against the disease came in 1889 by Florida governor Francis P. Fleming. Fleming pushed for the creation of a state health board to regulate health problems and fight the yellow fever outbreak. Consequently, a new state constitution was created in 1887 putting Fleming's suggestions into legislation.","Alleyne's letter to the London Times Editor connects Florida to England in the world trade market. Alleyne felt that an outbreak of Yellow Fever was important enough to write the leading newspaper in London, illustrating the dependence of both parties for each other's imports and exports. In addition, Alleyne was able to paint a picture of how difficult life on the frontier was in the nineteenth century. Seminole attacks, outbreaks of disease, and aggressive Spanish inhabitants were everyday threats that Florida citizens had to cope with. Nevertheless, the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Florida produced a new state constitution and the creation of the Florida State Health Board.

Miss Baldwin reported that the school enrollment was at capacity and there was even a wait-list. There were many delicate pupils whose parents sent them to Staunton because of the healthful climate and atmosphere. The school's students hailed from 23 states. Miss Baldwin even noted that there were no deaths that year. She also believed that the school had succeeded in teaching the pupils practical skills for life and a deeper sense of their personal responsibility to God. The school gave awards for many different subjects, including Latin, French, German, Faithful Practice on Piano, and English composition. Seven young women received diplomas for Music and Book-keeping."," <em>The Staunton Spectator</em>, the Augusta County weekly newspaper, ran the article as the lead local article. The paper reported the programme for each day's celebration and all participants' names. For the concert section, the names were given in a standard formal formula of Misses M Bingham, C Woodard, A Wine.... For the awards section, there was a less formal tone. The professors and instructors had titles, but the paper did not list the young women's names with Miss and some were in their common form, such as Annie instead of Anne and Lizzie instead of Elizabeth. "," Some young women attended Augusta Female Seminary for health reasons, but there were women attending because they had families who believed Catharine Beecher's principle that women needed a practical education to be successful mothers and wives and, eventually, she believed, have a profession. For the expanding middle class created by industrialization and urbanization in America, there began a trend to send young women to schools because the importance of women's work grew. According to Janet James, the question of to what extent women should be educated was entertained by everyone and in magazines, novels, plays and books. Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire. That the young women came from so many different states indicates the new connectivity that Staunton experienced because of the railroads."],"display_date":"May 28, 1886 - June 1, 1886","search_date":"1886-05-30","locations":[{"id":13641,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3604,"title":"The Love and Marriage of Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L.

Hubard wrote approximately twenty letters to each other on topics ranging from the health of their respective families to the passion they shared for each other. Randolph lived in Buckingham County, Virginia and made occasional visits to White Sulphur Springs (now a city in West Virginia) while Hubard, who was originally from the same area, wrote his letters from several different locations around Virginia, including Richmond. Presumably, Hubard's recent commission as a colonel of the Virginia militia in 1858 required him to travel frequently for prolonged periods. During this period, militias sprung up all across central Virginia in response to the call for war. In addition to Hubard and Randolph's correspondence, James' little brother Robert T. Hubard also weighed in on the young couple's nuptials, adding his perspective, insight, and advice on starting life together in central Virginia as well as his dealings with African American slaves.","In his first letters to Randolph, Hubard expressed his concern for the health of his future mother-in-law; apparently, she suffered from some sort of ailment that required treatment in the city of White Sulphur Springs. Eventually, Randolph wrote that her mother had gotten better but complained of lovesickness within her own breast, imploring Hubard to break away from his work and visit as soon as possible. The two clearly cared extraordinarily deeply for one another; with each sighing request from Isaetta, James responded with his own assuaging remarks intended to reassure her of his unyielding love, expressed his regret that he could not come visit, and enumerated the many times throughout his daily activities that his mind wandered to her. The couple's excitement builds noticeably throughout the last few weeks of their correspondence, both writing repeatedly about how much they miss the other and, somewhat peculiarly, how their families long to be united through their impending marriage. In a separate letter, Robert T. Hubard wrote about the sickness of his wife Phyllis and that of several of his black slaves; because the slaves were exposed to a mysterious contagion, Robert decided to have Charity [and] her family moved to the house 200 yds west of Sam's house, as [he] did not like to have sick negroes so near [his] dwelling home. ","The relationship between Isaetta Carter Randolph and James L. Hubard was fraught with the difficulties often faced by southern couples during the antebellum period of the nineteenth century. Hubard, a recently commissioned colonel, was separated from Randolph but managed to save their relationship through his persistent writing. Moreover, the desire of the two affluent families to unite with one another represents a common desire of wealthy southerners to prolong their legacy through intermarriage. Their family's wealth, and to some degree benign nature, is exemplified in Robert's letter regarding his sick slaves. A nuanced reading of Robert's distancing of the slaves from his house reveals a form of racial suspicion regarding sick negroes; it seems as if he was more fearful of what was ailing them due their race than the because of the actual sickness itself. At the same time however, the slaves lived in family units, a condition that must tragically be considered a luxury considering the frequency with which children were separated fromtheir parents and husbands were stripped of their wives in the business of slavery."],"display_date":"August 8, 1860 - November 15, 1860","search_date":"1860-09-26","locations":[{"id":13691,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3610,"title":"Washington Says Farewell to Dick Wallach\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-02-26","end_date":"1881-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 26, 1881, the <em>Evening Star</em> printed an article, 'A Noble Life' about Mr. Richard Wallach. Though he had not yet passed away, the city was already mourning his inevitable passing that was sure to come within days.  The residents of Washington, D.C. had been proud to call Richard Wallach their Mayor for several years, and news of his impending death caused many to reflect on the beneficial impact he had had on the city and the well-being of all who lived in it. ","While he was mayor the City Hall, which had previously acquired the bad name of 'the Buzzard's Roost,' was very unhospitable quarters for the noble army of jobbers and strikers, said the <em>Star</em>, describing how full of integrity Mr. Wallach was. That same day, the <em>National Republican</em> sang his praises in an article entitled, 'Waiting for Death': As a citizen he was enterprising, energetic, liberal, laboring zealously and faithfully for the city, which appreciated his efforts on her behalf. Clearly, 'Dick' Wallach's personal and professional integrity had manifested itself in his mayoral accomplishments; the man had set the bar for mayors in Washington's future.  Mr. Wallach passed away during the afternoon on March 4th, 1881. His funeral was attended by many prominent members of the community, black and white, male and female. ","What made Mr. Wallach's death so monumental to the Washington D.C. community was the fact that he symbolized all that education reform had done and was continuing to do for the community. Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3611,"title":"Snuff Dipping and Mint Juleps\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-07-13","end_date":"1838-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women must be ladies first, opined The Raleigh Register.  In the event of tea this afternoon, there was a young woman partaking in activities that had attained epidemic proportions in the Raleigh city area: which is the disgusting, and vulgar act of snuff dipping.  An activity that had previously been specific to males in the community, appeared to have caught on with women once thought of as respectable ladies. This material was injurious and dangerous for women to even be experimenting with because from the words of professionals in the medical field and those of authority women were often made absolutely drunk by the substance.","Ladies were using the snuff with casual attitudes and little regard for their health and images in the public eye.  This was an utter injustice to their beauty and civility, which would not help them in attracting pursuers in the least.  Men expected women to be fragile creations, who changed the wilderness of earth into a garden and brought civility and manners to the household.  A significant problem with women allowing themselves to become addicted to such disturbing drugs was their probability of taking other intoxicants like loathsome Mint Juleps that would soon follow.  It was common knowledge that constant use of any powerful stimulant will be seen to create a desire for other and stronger stimulants.  The practice of snuffing was one that belonged to men because it was far too unbecoming and dangerous for naive women.  Women sought chivalrous treatment and privilege from the gentlemen of society, but it was appalling for them to behave as barbarians, and no man of distinguished stature would be tolerant of such nonsense. ","Womanhood in the Old South entailed the idea of women presenting themselves as good wives with domestic and common sense, in order to be pleasing both physically and in their mannerisms to potential suitors.  For women to participate in vulgar and unattractive activities refutes historian Mark Smith's description of the ingrained nature of Southern females to express a certain amount of piety and conservative lifestyles, and he claims that Southern men often found their unappealing behaviors sinful with implications of their lack of faith or respect for God.  These were considered pioneering times in the socialization of women.  They were encouraged to conform to the male dominant ideology, and live as servants to male opinions. The divisions between the most simplistic social activities that were deemed acceptable in roles for males versus females became larger issues because women were dependent on either fathers or husbands for financial stability thus forcing them to behave under strict male standards of behavior."],"display_date":"July 13, 1838","search_date":"1838-07-13","locations":[{"id":9841,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3618,"title":"Jacob Enders Buries a Slave Child\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1845 Jacob Enders, an undertaker employed by Dr. Marcus B. Buck of Fluvanna County, Virginia, constructed a coffin, dug a grave, and buried an African American child for the total fee of two dollars and seventy-five cents. This receipt of service is included in a collection of other receipts and letters; a doctor's bill from one John Thomson, dated December 29, 1840 and a letter from Buck's wife are among the most notable documents that exist from around the same time period of the slave's burial. In the letter from Elizabeth P. Buck, she tells the unknown addressee that her husband is quite and that she wants him to go over the ridge, or into the valley. Nineteenth-medicine had very few remedies for the many ailments of central Virginian farmers, and these sicknesses were often transferred from among members of a family living in close quarters as well to and slaves that may have worked on the plantation.","Jacob Enders' notation of the services he rendered for Buck is nondescript and exceedingly simple. The transaction is divided into two parts, enumerated in column form with the description of his action on the left and the price associated with each deed. First, Enders lists Making coffin for Negro child and the figure of one dollar and twenty-five cents; next, Digging grave and interring same is listed as costing one dollar and fifty cents. The coffin was probably made of simple wooden planks and the burial sight was most likely unadorned, perhaps marked by an inauspicious headstone or cross. The life of this particular slave child exists in the mere three lines of Jacob Enders' receipt.","No matter how historians may characterize certain slave owners as benevolent masters who took good care of their slaves, life on a central Virginian plantation for a field slave was brutal. Summers in Fluvanna County were at times unbearably hot and humid, and the close living quarters available to slaves of middle-class farmers were undoubtedly hotbeds for sickness and disease. The fact that Jacob Enders' receipt is apparently scattered amongst other records from Buck's family and friends, including various other doctors' bills and general correspondence from his wife, suggests the insignificance of the young slave's life. Unlike Robert Campbell, a barber in nearby Augusta County whose life was remembered fondly and was actually memorialized in an obituary, this particular slave child was buried anonymously and ignobly. Though human life was expensive on an economic scale, the only record of Buck memorializing or reflecting on the death of this particular human being is captured in a simple document of sale. The inconsequential regard for African American life and the poor living conditions of meager, slaveholding farmers are demonstrated in this incident."],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3620,"title":"A Day In the Life of an Amelia County Physician\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-17","end_date":"1831-12-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Like many county and small town physicians, Dr. Stirling Ford cultivated close relationships with many of his frequent patients. Thus, when some of his patients were unable to pay their medical bills, he would extend a grace period or wave the fee altogether. This more than likely accounted for the meticulous records of his daily visits and the financial accounts of his patients. One of Dr. Ford's wealthier and well known patients was Governor William Branch Giles. Giles died on December 4, 1830 after a brief illness. Dr. Ford chose not to charge Giles' family for the services rendered toward the end of Giles' life because he viewed the family more as friends than patients, no charge for personal attendance- in this I will consult my private feelings. Indeed much of my attendance was to consult the feelings of the family as a friend. Dr. Ford's journal reflected many other close friendships with his patients. In fact, Dr. Ford had a special method for differentiating the class and race of his patients."," In the early nineteenth century medical knowledge was still in its infancy. Prior to the Civil War the majority of doctors in the United States were trained through apprenticeships, if the doctor training the apprentices was competent he would produce competent doctors. In the case of Dr. Ford it seems as though he was one of the doctors to have received a quality apprenticeship. The most commonly prescribed treatment in Southside Virginia was quinine, which remedied maladies such as malaria. Other drugs prescribed for common afflictions during the nineteenth century were chalybeate pills, charcoal pills, morphine, and opium. Dr. Stirling Ford often prescribed such drugs to his patients.

In his journal, Dr. Ford gives an account of the slave woman's condition and treatment prescribed for her blister to the neck and open bowels [and] debility headache. Although it might seem normal that a doctor would treat an ailing person, not all nineteenth century physicians were willing to take on African Americans, free or enslaved, as patients. Dr. Ford, on the other hand, was known for giving free smallpox vaccines to his patients, both white and colored. Some southern states went as far as requiring masters to provide for proper maintenance of their slaves, this care was mainly achieved through the care of ailing slaves by their master or mistress. Following the 1808 abolition of the international slave trade, the health of slaves became a matter of greater importance to slave owners. Thus, many slave owners paid more attention to seeing that the basic dietary needs of their slaves were met. "," Again, Dr. Stirling Ford was one of the unique physicians willing to treat blacks. In his journal, Dr. Ford delineated all of his patients by various codes according to class, gender, and race. He referred to patients the black patients he served as man, woman, and child. Never in Dr. Ford's records did he use the word slave; instead he referred to enslaved peoples as servant. Though many of his contemporaries did not treat blacks, Dr. Ford was a kindly man, who took his duties as a physician seriously and served all in need of his services. On several occasions, Dr. Ford recorded visiting large plantations, noting that he visited the family, both white and colored. His reference to the black community living on the plantation as the family is an unusual term of endearment reflecting the affectionate concern held by the responsible class of slave owners for the well-being or the slaves that they owned and possibly Dr. Ford's personal views regarding slavery."," Though the law insured some level of healthcare for enslaved people, as aforementioned, many doctors refused to render their medical services to black patients. This attitude can be attributed to the popular belief in the inferiority of black people. This belief in the inferiority of blacks was used not only as a justification for slavery but received a good amount of ill researched of scientific support. The general medical consensus was that blacks were better suited mentally and physically in the environs of the slave south, where they worked arduously in the fields."],"display_date":"November 18, 1831","search_date":"1831-11-18","locations":[{"id":13611,"lat":37.3359551661,"lng":-77.9760581709,"zoom":10,"place":"AMELIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3641,"title":"The Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia Receives a Generous Donation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-01-01","end_date":"1817-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Eighteen Sixteen was an eventful year for the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia. The number of girls under the care of the Society was increased to twenty and a smallpox scare in the city required a visit from Society Physician Dr. Alex Whitehead for a round of vaccinations for all the girls. However, certainly the biggest event of the year happened in July when the Society received a letter from a generous citizen of the city. The letter was from the Executor of the will of Captain John Maxwell informing the Society that 2,500 had been bequeathed to them for the purpose of establishing an Asylum for Female Orphans. Additionally, Captain Maxwell's Executor had already purchased a lot on Brigg's Point for the new structure."," The 1816 annual report of the Female Orphan Society shows their elation at receiving such a large donation. The report states that they would desire... to proclaim our gratitude to our deceased benefactor & to God, the inspirer of all good, for this generous gift which promises to perpetuate our institution as a lasting honor & blessing to the community. Their happiness is well understood when one considers the average yearly earnings of a small-time farmer during the era was well under one thousand dollars. Simply put, 2,500 was a lot of money."," The Female Orphan Society was not a fledgling organization. It was founded in 1804 by Norfolk women in order to provide a temporary home, education and training for indigent white girls, orphans or otherwise. In order to stay afloat, the organization relied on the generosity of private individuals, churches, relief agencies, and finally clubs or other organizations to provide food, clothing, education for the wards, and wages for Society employees. The fact that after twelve years the organization had not yet acquired their own building shows the difficulty of financing a charitable organization such as the Society. In fact, at the time the Society received the donation, they were just deciding that they had sufficient funds to attempt to look for a lot for the construction of their own building. Such a large donation allowed the Society to build a larger building than perhaps they had hoped, enabling them to expand the breadth of their charitable work. Orphan Societies such as the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk factored greatly in the lives of America's poor children from the early nineteenth century until the 1920s. The Society of Norfolk was typical of these early institutions in that it was established to help female children and dealt mostly with children who had one or more parents living. These institutions served to help a family through tough times by providing for a child until the parent was able to do so themselves. The Norfolk Society was also indicative of Orphan Societies at the beginning of the nineteenth century in that it was entirely funded by private donations and managed by specific religious organizations. "," Orphan Societies began to be established in response to changes in the United States as a whole. During the early nineteenth century, American cities experienced massive growth due to European immigration. Cities grew by leaps and bounds and the population of urban poor grew with them. Additionally, the growth of wage labor often left many of these poor families unable to care for their children after a tragedy like the loss of a parent. Finally, improved transportation facilitated the easier spread of diseases like cholera, which led to a spike in the establishment of orphanages after an epidemic in the 1830s. By the Civil War, Orphan Societies had become very common across the United States and were thought of as being the best way to manage the upbringing and education of poor children outside of their own homes."],"display_date":"January 1, 1816 - January 1, 1817","search_date":"1816-07-02","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3643,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-07-17","end_date":"1830-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":"July 17, 1830","search_date":"1830-07-17","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3648,"title":"Settling the Debts of Robert Riddick\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-12-13","end_date":"1827-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 13, 1819, Joseph Prentis took over as the Executor of the will of the late Robert M. Riddick of Nansemond County due to the death of the named executor, Thomas Swepson. Mr. Riddick's will called for the disposal of his estate for the payment of his debts. However, Riddick stipulated that in order to raise the deficiency [the Executor was] fully authorized and requested to mortgage the lands and to hire out the slaves for the purpose. For the next eight years, Mr. Prentis hired out Riddick's slaves to neighboring farmers in order to pay off the debts of the deceased. At the time of his death, Robert Riddick owned eighteen slaves. This number, while not huge, was quite substantial and suggested a sizable agricultural operation. Although, when one looks at Mr. Prentis' description of the slaves and the value he placed on each, one can see that perhaps the number alone can be a bit misleading. ","Of the eighteen slaves Mr. Prentis listed in his account book on December 31, 1819, only six were adult males. Furthermore, of those six only two were considered valued over 300 and one of those, Tom Bray valued at 350, was well past his prime at forty-eight years of age. However, Armistead was valued at 500 because he was only eighteen years of age and presumably had a whole lifetime of labor in front of him. The only other male slave close to the value of Tom Bray and Armistead was a man named Jacob, described by Prentis as a small and weakly fellow forty two years old. The other three men were worthless or close to it. Dempsey, valued at 100, was approaching at fifty-five years old. The remaining two, Mingo and Jimmy, both were appraised at 0. Mingo was around seventy years old and very diseased having lost one eye and nearly blind in the other while Jimmy was about sixty years of age and listed as very decrepit. The twelve other slaves that constituted Robert Riddick's property were all adult females and their small children. Of these there were three adult women appraised at 300 or higher. These three were all between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-nine years old, prime childbearing ages."," Further reading into the account book of Mr. Prentis reveals that he was able to hire out Mr. Riddick's slaves to pay off the late man's debts, as directed in the will. Naturally, the amount received for each slave hired out makes sense when compared to their values listed earlier. In the year 1820, old Jimmy was hired out for only five dollars. The small and weak Jacob fetched 32.50 while fifty-five year-old Dempsey earned thirty dollars. Although much younger than Tom Bray, Armistead was hired out for 34 while Tom was hired for 55. Though one cannot be sure, this was probably due to the fact that the older Tom had some skill that was in demand by his temporary master."," The story of Robert Riddick, his slaves, and the posthumous management of his estate was a common one in the slave-holding South. Southern slaveholders, while wealthy in land and human property, did not have a lot of capital at their disposal and frequently purchased on credit which often plunged them into debt. The death of a slaveholder required that those debts be settled, and often that was accomplished through the hiring out of slaves to raise the money necessary to pay the creditors. This process was time-consuming but it allowed the late slaveholder's family to retain ownership of the slaves that a quick settlement of the estate (i.e. the auction of the slaves) would not accomplish. The amount of time it took to pay off the debts of a deceased slaveholder through the hiring of his slave property could vary greatly depending upon the size of his debts and the sex, age, and physical condition of his slaves. For example, the job of settling Riddick's debts may have taken less time if half of his slaves had been young, healthy males like Armistead. Richard Randolph a Prince Edward County slaveholder discussed in Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, owned a great number of slaves that were to be manumitted upon his death. However, his wife kept them in bondage for a further ten years until the debts could be settled. The fact that slaveholders were willing to wait years to pay off debts through slave-hiring speaks to the value of slave property in the antebellum South. Southerners would rather wait than loose their property forever in a quick sale."],"display_date":"December 13, 1819 - December 31, 1827","search_date":"1823-12-22","locations":[{"id":14070,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3654,"title":"A Family Reels from a Death in Southwest Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-07-19","end_date":"1844-07-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 19, 1844, William King, Jr. reported sad news to his sister Sarah C. King of Abingdon, Virginia. Their younger brother had died. Sarah had visited just a few weeks prior to the death. Everything was fine then in the town of Saltville, Virginia. Life had been pleasant when she visited her family. After all, she did not get to see them often since her marriage. Several weeks later, her family's harmony was interrupted by the death of her brother by illness. Her other brother William sent a horse to retrieve Sarah so she could take part in the funeral. Obviously angered at his brother's quick death at such a young age, William wrote his sister, Death is foredominant Today [at] about 5 O'clock youngest brother died ","This strong language emphasized the family's loss.  The tragedy in the King family not only altered their family dynamic, it prompted the family to take the necessary steps in burial and healing in the wake of the death. William not only wanted to alert his sister of the death as quickly as possible to bring the family together, he also wanted to execute appropriate cultural practices. Before the Civil War in the nineteenth century, it was the role of the women in the family to prepare the body. The women had to clean the body to arrange it for burial. Since the King burial took place in a rural setting where families did not have access to medical practices such as embalming, which were accessible in urban environments, the family had to take care of the body before decomposition. In all likelihood, there were not other women in King's family other than his sister who were available to treat the body. So it seems that William was so urgent to get his sister home, because he may have needed her to prepare the body before decomposition. ","The King family's loss and how they reacted to it could be used to illustrate general patterns related to death and dying in the South. Whether it was because of the numerous epidemics spreading throughout Virginia and the South or because medicine in the rural setting truly fell far behind its urban counterparts, people died young. Living in the South during the nineteenth century meant living under the threat of death, illness-related or not. The South reacted to these deaths realistically by getting the body buried before decomposition. From assisting the dying to preparing the dead to carrying out the burial, dealing with death in the antebellum South was characteristically a family affair.

Domestic Medicine, Or Poor Man's Friend, In the Hours of Affliction, Pain and Sickness by Dr. John Gunn was first published in 1830 and became one of the leading books on medicine in the South during that time. Many southerners confided in his knowledge of medicine when they needed help. One point that Gunn raises in his book is the idea of education in the South. He believed that education needed to consist more in a knowledge of things, and less in a knowledge of mere words. Schools and universities spent too much time teaching subjects such as history and English when they needed to focus more on the sciences and the study of medicine. Because of this lack of focus, the general knowledge of sickness and medicine in central Virginia during this time was very low, leading to numerous deaths from common colds and diseases.

Roper's narrative also reflects the treatment of mulattos since even some black blood in a person meant that a person did not deserve freedom.

When Joseph's mother read him one disturbing account from Ireland, his first instinct was to run and get his moneybox. After returning with it, Joseph informed his mom that he was going to carry his money to the man in charge of collecting donations to send to damaged families in Ireland so that his money could be used to feed and clothe the little boys in Ireland. The story of little Joseph is priceless, despite its obvious intention of boosting public awareness and aid to the devastated country. The boy took all of his savings, one hundred and three cents, and gave it all away with the best intentions. The author described in detail Joseph's sparkling eyes, claiming that they showed the workings of a truly generous heart. The author of the article felt that this story was an important account to convey to the public, declaring that such acts deserve to be noticed and commended. He also observed another little boy being entertained by the same story, read by his father just like little Joseph, the boy asked if he too could give his money away to help those in foreign lands.Though relief aid was vital and absolutely necessary for reconstructing the Irish economy, there were numerous disadvantageous circumstances that arose, even with massive amounts of foreign funds pouring in. L. P. Curtis' incumbered wealth illustrates some of these problems. Curtis states that both landlords and tenants depended on an elaborate and secretive system of short and long-term goals. Furthermore, in the post famine period, after the rural economy had become completely monetized, virtually every tenant farmer owed money to someone at one time or another. Despite these shortcomings, it was still acceptable to feel the way Joseph and the other little boy did during such a crisis.

Another guard saw him and began firing, which alarmed other guards to begin firing as they were chasing after him.

Floyd of Newberry District, South Carolina owned Ephraim and, in September 1862, sent him to the coast of South Carolina to assist with work on Confederate fortifications at the request of the Governor of South Carolina. Tribble took command of the slave upon his arrival. Shortly thereafter, Ephraim contracted an undisclosed disease and was placed under the care of Doctor Wrag. Despite intensive medical treatment, Ephraim suffered for several weeks from the illness before his death on October 8, 1862.  Tribble noted that Ephraim \"died in service of the Confederate Government.\" Ephraim was only twenty-three at the time of his death and was, by all accounts, a healthy and reliable source of labor for the Confederate Army. Upon his death, he was worth 1,300.","The impressment of blacks such as Ephraim was very common throughout the South during the Civil War. Both slaves and free blacks were pressed into service to meet the demands brought about by the war. Some slaveowners hired out their slaves with some form of compensation from the army, while the government mandated the impressment of others in order to meet the increased demands. Although many slaveholders opposed it, the impressment of blacks provided a significant boost to the wartime economy. African Americans performed tasks such as work on transportation lines and fortifications as well as the production of war material and supplies, principally serving as an \"auxiliary labor force\" to the Confederate Army."],"display_date":"January 12, 1864","search_date":"1864-01-12","locations":[{"id":14093,"lat":37.5053580744,"lng":-77.0015005804,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW KENT, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3885,"title":"Sanitation in Medicine\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-09","end_date":"1895-03-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    On March 9th, 1895, the <em>Times and Registrar</em> published an article detailing a new hypodermic syringe.

A screw-on needle kept the syringe itself from being dangerous, decreasing the chance of sticks and accidents.  Though the metal casing itself could be used many times, proving both useful and durable, the sanitation advantage of a sealed glass tube that contained the medications and fluid samples meant a lower risk of infection from person to person, be the victims patients or doctors.","    During the early nineteenth century, medical science was closer to the art of clever guessing than the practice of proven and solid facts.  The concept of the four humors, or the four principle body fluids, was still considered a fact until the American Civil War.  Previously, doctors would take a sick patient and assume that one of his humors was out of balance – either blood, phlegm, yellow bile [choler], or black bile [melancholy] – and so would take on the task of restoring balance to the patient's humors.","    Because the concept of disease was vague and often rooted in social and political agendas, the idea of sanitation was rather foreign.  It wasn't until the American Civil War, when medical officers and commanders alike began to notice that disease often followed battle.

Caps, gowns, gloves, and masks were all instituted as further sanitation measures.","    The <em>Times and Registrar's</em> March 9th article was a realistic and expected end to a century of quickly changing ideas and attitudes towards the medical profession.

In <em>The Mariner's Chronicle</em>, one gentleman on board described the scene in the boiler room as a \"complete wreck - a picture of destruction\".  He witnessed one man with \"the whole of the forehead blown away: the brains were still beating.  Tufts of hair, shreds of clothing, and splotches of blood might be seen in every direction\".  Outside the boiler room \"on every side were to be heard groans and mingled exclamations of grief and despair\" as men and women dealt with the injured.  One man's face \"was entirely black; his body without a particle of skin.  He had been flayed alive\".  To witness such horrors - fellow passengers in pain, near death, and begging for death to \"free them from present suffering\" - devastated the survivors.  The gentleman judged that between forty and fifty people perished either instantly, from injury, from inhaling steam or gas, or from drowning.  "," No doubt people faced danger when traveling during the 19th century.   John Burke in \"Bursting Boilers and Federal Power\" stated that between 1816 and 1848 about 233 steamboat explosions occurred.  The lack of regulation on the boilers at that time contributed to most of the accidents.  Steamboat explosions caused the loss of goods affecting the economy as well as the loss of lives affecting each individual and each family.  Ultimately, the loss of lives and goods played a crucial role in affecting American history.  The number of lives lost compelled American legislation to question how steamboats could become safer and whether federal power had the right to create regulatory agencies.    ","In 1824, the <em>Gibbons v Ogden</em> ruling handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that \"the power to regulate commerce, so far as it extends, is exclusively vested in Congress\" allowing Congress to regulate private business and to interfere where government had never interfered before.  As more steamboat explosions killed more lives, the American people reacted.  In 1830, Secretary of Treasury Samuel D. Ingham gave money to The Franklin Institute to experiment and inspect steam engine boilers.  The combination of the number of deaths due to explosions and the data from the experiments forced the Steamboat Act of 1838 to become law.  The Steamboat Act of 1852 established the Steamboat Inspection Service, one of the first federal agency to regulate private industry, allowing the Act of 1838 to be enforced by a government agency.  Aside from safer traveling, the impact of this legislation still affects Americans.  John Ward in \"The Future of an Explosion\" further explained, \"From that distant carnage on the rivers of the West came the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and all the other government regulatory and investigative agencies that seek to protect us today\".  A steamboat explosion occurring in 1830 changed the lives of Americans far after other transportation replaced steamboats.  The loss of human life makes a difference."],"display_date":"February 24, 1830","search_date":"1830-02-24","locations":[{"id":12366,"lat":35.2121822757,"lng":-89.8820367379,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3894,"title":"Reverends Discuss Death and Religion Before Politics\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-05","end_date":"1832-12-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 5, 1832 Reverend James M. Chiles wrote a letter to fellow South Carolinian Reverend James C. Furman detailing the health of Chiles' family and the surge of religious revival in his area.  Chiles began the letter with an apology that it had taken him so long to respond offering the explanation that he had been close to death and his youngest sister had died.  Joy and sorrow flowed together as he lamented the determination of the diseases that attacked his family, but praised God for his sovereignty.  Chiles continued on matters of God, taking a more optimistic turn as he recounted the great spirit of revival in his area that year, and he told Furman about the many baptisms he was performing in local churches.   He briefly mentioned the \"excitement of politicks\" regarding their state and how he hoped they were rightly following the path of God.  After committing to pray for these events he ended his letter asking for a personal meeting with Furman to see each other and preach together.","  Chiles' letter echoes the attentions of many Americans during the early 1830s.  The masses had a general awareness of political events and conflicts, but they concentrated most on personal matters with a particular emphasis on disease, death, and religion.  The early 1830s brought an onslaught of contagious diseases such as influenza and cholera, but the simultaneous onset of a widespread Christian revival offered hope to families stricken by epidemic disease.  Americans believed that God was in control and looked forward to the promise of seeing loved ones again in the afterlife.  Additionally, with death and religion capturing the attention of the people, there was little time left to ponder the tenuous condition of state and federal affairs.  Chiles' vague mention of excitement in his area most likely refers to the nullification crisis of the early 1830s when outraged Southerners proposed to nullify the high tariffs they believed favored Northern manufacturing cities and crippled the South.  President Andrew Jackson objected to the nullifiers and proclaimed secession unconstitutional, even while Vice President John Calhoun (a South Carolinian) led the faction supporting nullification.  The same month that Chiles wrote his letter, December 1832, Calhoun stepped down from the vice presidency as tension rose over the split in ideology.  Henry Clay managed to mollify the situation with the Compromise Tariff in February 1833 by calling for a gradual lowering of tariffs which eased the threat of conflict for the present.  Even in the midst of such seemingly crucial events, personal matters still consumed individuals like Chiles and prevented them from entering into the political dialogue.

Carr had just returned from nursing her cousin, Maria, who was sick with a fever. The threats of illness and death were prominent in her words.  At this time, the term \"fever\" was used to describe almost every kind of dangerous ailment.  Contemporary physicians believe that most southerners who were sick with \"the fever\" were victims of Malaria.  Carr told of Maria's feeble condition, noting, \"I had been nursing cousin Maria Carr who is recovering slowly, but so slowly that we rather hope than perceive the change from a tedious and dangerous fever and reduced to such hopelessness.\"  Most southern families, including the Carrs, did not use nurses.  Family members, especially the women, became the caregivers for the sick.  This often caused diseases to spread throughout the family, as the concept of germs was not understood in the 1820s."," The availability of legitimate doctors in the South was scarce.  According to historian Steven Stowe, the nineteenth-century medical profession was highly unregulated; many alternative healers disguised themselves as medical doctors. This, accompanied with the lack of available medications, made recovery from even a simple fever dangerous. Though no one in Carr's immediate family had recently died, she described that many of her friends felt the fatal effects of illness.  A close friend, Ms. Martha Minor, lost her six-year-old son. In her letter, Carr described the torturous emotions of losing friends: \"I maybe have been tedious in dwelling upon the scenes of sickness and death which have engulfed my time and thoughts for some weeks past, and which are not easily obliterated.\"  Carr embodied the emotion of all southern people in the 1820s.

He proposed the construction of a huge public park that would \"be enjoyed by thousands of all classes, without distinction.\"  The ideals of Romanticism and the Republican view of the importance of nature were at a peak among educated Americans at this time and this commentator proposed a way to manifest these ideals.  New York City, being the largest city as well as the informational center, certainly had many who supported the idea that nature should be valued and used respectfully to enrich one's mind and refresh one's spirit.  From these beliefs arose the idea for the creation of a huge park to be enjoyed by all the citizens of New York City.  This journalist, in <u>The Horticulturist, and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste</u>, was one of the first to publish his opinions on the issue and explain the beginnings of such a park.  He criticized New York for not having enough open public spaces, and emphasized the Republican idea that nature is closely linked with virtue and comparing New York to cities in Europe, most of which had public parks.  The mayor of New York at the time, Ambrose Kingsland, had recently proposed 160 acres for a park.  This proposal was the first of its kind in America for park of such large scale, but the writer condemned this as being too small.  He suggested a 500 acre plot of land between the Harlem River and 39th, land that is in fact today part of Central Park.   Although this author's passionate essay on the importance of establishing a large park brought no immediate action, it marked the beginning of a huge public interest in such an endeavor.  Two years later, in 1853, there were still only 143 acres out of New York's 14,000 dedicated to public spaces, including cemeteries.  Many later authors continued the journalist's argument; one enumerated the reasons why such a park was a necessity for the city, being a haven for health, recreation, and driving and riding.  The park's approval and design finally took form in the late 1850's.  The proposal for Central Park had a huge impact on New York City as well as the patterns of urban development across the country."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":8924,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3909,"title":"The Great Escape &#40;From Fort Warren&#41;\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-11-01","end_date":"1864-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On a cold night in November 1864, an anonymous prisoner, who referred to himself as \"John Paul Brown\" in Boston's <em>Dollar Monthly Magazine</em>, assumed the guise of a carriage driver, hijacked a parked supply wagon carrying vegetables, and, \"with an artistic flourish of the whip, drove through the opened gates, unrecognized and unchallenged.\" Several days previously, his accomplice, whom he calls \"Jones,\" made his own dash to freedom. Upon his arrival on free soil, Jones contacted Brown and made arrangements for Brown's escape. They communicated through a clever system that involved passing each other magazines in which \"letters in different words were undermarked by a dot or period, and which letters, when put together, made an intelligible sentence.\" Once a time and meeting place were agreed upon, Jones sent a supply wagon as a means for Brown to escape. Brown was filled with elation when he reached freedom and met Jones until, unfortunately for the fugitives, the prison commander immediately confronted the men and accompanied both back to the prison. ","While this anonymous account relates the story of an escape attempt, it also alludes to the favorable conditions that existed in some prison camps during the Civil War. For instance, regarding the commander of the prison Brown reported, \"Major Wilkes is emphatically one of Natures noble-men...perfectly unassuming, even with those under his surveillance-wishing them well, and endeavoring to promote their comfort and happiness.\" Likewise, Fort Warren, to which Brown referred in the description of his escape, was known for its benevolent treatment of prisoners. In his diary, former Confederate Secretary of State Alexander H. Stephens attested to the accommodations offered in the Federal prison. He revealed that he had a large room with plenty of light, a bed of \"tolerable comfort,\" pure water, sufficient food, and \"the privilege of seeing daily papers and reading books\" during his detainment at Fort Warren. The prison itself was originally built in 1851 on an island in Boston Harbor as a Union fort that had been converted in 1861 to hold high-ranking officers and political prisoners during the Civil War. Due to the high social and military status of most prisoners, their treatment and living conditions were overall exemplary in quality. Historian Minor H. McLain even describes Fort Warren as \"an outstanding example of humanity in time of stress.\" Despite the problems it faced due to overcrowding when it first opened, Fort Warren only amassed a total of twelve prisoner deaths during its existence, while reaching a high of 394 captives in February 1865. However, the relatively small death count that Fort Warren accumulated serves as an exception to the atrocious mortality found in other prisons during the Civil War, such at Andersonville, Georgia; Elmira, New York; or Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia.","Of the approximately 193,750 Union soldiers captured, over 30,000 died in Confederate captivity, while nearly 26,000 out of the approximately 214,900 captured Southerners died in Federal prisons. Military historian Robert S. Davis gives mortality rates for the worst prisons on each side; as high as 35 percent at the worst Southern prison, as high as 24 percent at the worst Northern prison, and an average of 12 to 15 percent of the troops for both armies. Although these rates seem high enough to motivate anyone to flee captivity, it was also a soldier's duty to escape and rejoin his army in battle. Historian Pamela Hain gives evidence of this obligation when she cites several escape attempts made by prisoners at Fort Warren, despite numerous testimonies to its benevolent conditions compared to those at prisons elsewhere. As Brown suggested in the account of his escape, regardless of the quality of treatment, \"there are those as ready and anxious to escape from this, as from that, or any other prison.\""],"display_date":"November 1864","search_date":"1864-11-15","locations":[{"id":6210,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3926,"title":"Religion on the Battlefield\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-09-16","end_date":"1861-09-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    In an unsigned letter dated September 16, 1861, a Confederate soldier wrote to his family to tell of his first few weeks marching to war.

","    The anonymous Confederate soldier wrote home that \"[if] it should be the Lord's will that I should fall on the battlefield, it will all be right. [...] the great end of this life is to prepare for death, and an entrance upon another.\" Of those who followed Christian beliefs, historian Steven E. Woodworth writes that their faith \"encompassed many facets of life, and they also believed that this present life was not the conclusion of their existence.\" This most certainly gave soldiers a sense of relief and peace, know matter what experiences they may have to endure on Earth. The Confederate and Union soldiers not only had a high chance of dying on the battlefield but also that it would be a very gruesome or lingering death, especially when the main method of healing a musket wound was by amputation. But the soldier from Nansemond County found that not all men outwardly practiced their beliefs. He witnessed that the circumstances of \"camplife are any thing else but favorable to religion, or deeptoned piety. Here I see and here [sic] more wickedness in one week than all that I ever met before put together.\" ","    In his letter the soldier reasoned with his family and urged them not to worry, arguing \"this world is not my home, and we should never shudder, or grieve at the escape of those we love, from a dreary desert, to a pleasant home.\" Of those who were Christian, Woodworth asserts that many soldiers \"spoke feelingly of heaven as home.\" This brought comfort not only to the soldiers but also to their loved ones or survivors left behind and out of the danger of war. ","    At the tail end of the soldier's letter he firmly advised his family to follow the word of God. \"Make the service of God the great object of your life, and He will make your salvation the great care of His heart.\" Woodworth states that many citizens and soldiers alike viewed \"heaven as a place of happy meeting.\" This view comforted both those close to death and those left alive. Soldiers and civilians both had the reassurance that death was not the end but only the beginning of life. The soldier not only wanted to ensure his own seat in heaven but those of his family as well so he could die peacefully with the knowledge that he would see them again.

Just days earlier, a catastrophic fire had destroyed the Huger's plantation home in Clermont, South Carolina; upon finding this out, Mrs. Horry had written a letter to her niece to ensure the Huger family's health. ","As Harriet Huger narrated in the letter to her aunt, the fire did no serious harm to the family. Although one of Harriet's daughters did suffer mildly from smoke inhalation after the blaze, the young mother's letter states plainly that \"the rest of the family [is] in good health,\" a fact that she looked upon with obvious gratitude.","Coincidentally, Harriet Huger's letter also described the family's intentions following the fire, saying that \"the greater part of our furniture was saved without much injury,\" and illustrating the family's plans for the near future. Part of a prosperous family (evidenced by the fact that Harriet, as a woman, could read and write exceptionally well), Harriet also mentioned that the family's \"two [slave] carpenters...immediately set about fitting up one of our outbuildings for our summer accommodation.\" ","With luxuries such as education and slave labor at their disposal, Harriet Huger and her family certainly belonged to South Carolina's planter class. In fact, according to South   Carolina historian Henry White, the affluent Huger-Pinckney family had been involved in large-scale rice planting since the first decade of the nineteenth century and owned \"among the rice fields...a spacious home.\" ","Despite their wealth, the devasting house fire <em>certainly</em> affected the Huger family. For one, the blaze destroyed an ancestral home of considerable value that had been passed down continuously over several generations. Also, as her letter clearly expresses, the burning of her house shook Harriet Huger emotionally, a fact she expresses to her aunt in the vain hope that her family \"be exempt from domestic calamity.\" Even so, Harriet and the rest of the Huger family were quite fortunate, for they rebuilt their plantation home within one year of the blaze due to the vast agricultural wealth held in the family coffers.","While the Huger family was quite privileged, both in their affluence and personal safety, the opportunities they enjoyed following their house fire were certainly not available to all Southern families.

Dated December 21, 1822, the letter described some of the details of Perkins' journey, including an illness that befell one of his traveling companions, Betty: \"...all well exept bety and she has bin very sick on the road hardly expected her to liv and was very trobesom on the road with that not in her side....\"  The description of the \"not in her side\" seems to imply that Betty suffered from some kind of pain, or possibly even a bulge, on the side of her body.  Historian Thomas Wertenbaker asserts that medical knowledge in the antebellum South was rudimentary at best.  Especially in rural plantation societies like Virginia and Maryland, doctors were hard to find, and even if found they were not always likely to be consulted.  Many in the South believed that doctors did more harm than good, which is probably true considering their widespread use of such treatments as bloodletting and their lack of knowledge concerning germ theory.  In this light it is understandable why Perkins did not hold out much hope for Betty's survival.","      According to F. N. Boney, a number of Southern doctors in the antebellum period performed medical experiments on slaves.  Doctors used the prevailing belief that blacks were inferior to whites to justify the often grotesque procedures to which they subjected slaves.  They performed many experiments, including the trial of a new (and highly dangerous) vaccination procedure and even an effort to discover an effective surgical method for sealing clefts that caused bladder leakage.  Slaves endured unimaginable pain and suffering due to such atrocities, but in the doctors' minds it was all in the name of science.  Regardless of the means through which discoveries were made, medical science in the antebellum South left much to be desired.  Concepts that are considered self-evident today, such as germ theory, were unknown at the time.  Perkins described most of his traveling as such: it \"...was water Bound three times and was very mody....\"  Frequently surrounded by water and mud, his traveling party must have come into contact with an untold amount of pathogens.  Although these days it is viewed as common knowledge, many people in the antebellum South may have had no idea that such conditions could be breeding grounds for disease.  Unfortunately, Betty suffered the consequences of this lack of knowledge.

The list of this young boy's maladies continues in the article.  One would think this boy had no hope for survival from whatever illness had attacked his young body.  However, \"on taking these Drops he recovered the use of his limbs, the sores healed up and he was restored to health, although thought incurable.\"  It does not seem plausible that a boy could suddenly return to full health after only taking some drops.  Was this a medical miracle or a fabrication of the truth?","    Apparently, Dr. Relfe's Botanical Drops were more than just an advertising gimmick.  According to the <em>Kentucky Gazette</em>, these drops \"have, in a multitude of cases, cured these...deep routed complaints in their worst and most hopeless stages.\"  While malaria was the disease for which Dr. Relfe created his drops, the advertisement stated that these drops were also successful in curing \"violent eruptions after the measles; red blotches, festering eruptions and pimples on the face.\"  The advertisement followed with several cases, much like those of the little boy, in which people were suffering from these ailments without any hope of a full recovery.  Symptoms ranged from \"humors\" on the neck of one older woman to blindness in both eyes of a five year-old girl.  Every person was in distress and hopeless until they took Dr. Relfe's drops.  According to this advertisement, it seems as if Dr. Relfe's drops were indeed a miracle.","    Disease, especially malaria, was distinctive in the southern region of the United   States.  Due to the hot climate in the summer, the South was a breeding ground for mosquitoes.  Infection rates increased during the change from the cool to warm seasons.  As malaria and other forms of the \"fever\" spread throughout the South, these diseases started to shape southern culture.  For instance, Southerners began to change their diets to help keep their immune system strong for the summer seasons.  Others started to address and attack reckless behavior among their community members.  For example, alcoholism and risky sexual behavior seemed to increase the likelihood of disease, as these bad habits lead to terrible hygiene and sloppiness, which left people susceptible to disease.  ","    It was the local doctors who stood at the center of this disease prevention and control.  Their importance in the community was significant as they provided remedies when all else failed.  Members of the community depended on them for guidance and advice.  In the South, they were not only doctors.  They were a part of the community.  This sense of belonging pushed local physicians to work extra hard in finding cures for ailments.  After all, these infected people were more than just patients.  They were neighbors, family members and friends.  This drive to help those they knew brought about huge advances in modern medicine as doctors worked to find remedies for the many diseases they encountered.  Without the bond between physicians and their community that existed in the South, it is difficult to say if modern medicine would have been able to evolve as quickly as it did."],"display_date":"December 29, 1832","search_date":"1832-12-29","locations":[{"id":4796,"lat":38.0422598094,"lng":-84.4586978215,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3956,"title":"The Education of African Americans After the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-01-01","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Our crops are poor on account of too much wet in the summer which prevented us from working with them,\" John McClure, a resident of Albemarle  County, wrote to his aunt and uncle.  He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.  Unfortunately, though, with the turn of the century, Edward Ayers notes that \"blacks in the south paid for schools for whites--not the other way around.  The more black citizens in a county, the greater the benefits to white students.\"  Racial tensions would not disappear for some time."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":13600,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3960,"title":"Conditions at Andersonville Reach All-Time Low\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-04-01","end_date":"1865-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When Robert Kellogg was finally released from the Confederate prison camp at Andersonville in 1865, he had only the shirt on his back and his life to his name.  He was fortunate to be a part of a soldier exchange that allowed him to return to the North, and when he boarded the steamboat to make the journey home, he was met with a new uniform, a new pair of boots, a bath, and a hot meal.  However, these luxuries were a far cry from the horrors he and the other Union soldiers experienced in the prison camp at Andersonville.  Before arriving at Camp Sumter, Kellogg and the men in his company had been under the care of a group of Confederate soldiers who had been released from a Union prison.  He and his comrades were well fed, and had a distinctly positive view of their pre-Andersonville captors.  He noted that the southerners were \"a gentlemanly set of fellows, and treated the northern soldier with some consideration.\"  The men were able to procure rations and other pleasure items from southern citizens through purchase and trade, and enjoyed a fairly comfortable existence.  "," The time before they reached Andersonville set the men up for a great shock, however, as conditions at the prison worsened daily.  When the men arrived, the sight of other prisoners foretold the fate awaiting them.  As one former prisoner said of his first sight of the camp, \"The uncheerful sight, near the gate, of a pile of ghastly dead - the eyes of whom shone with a stony glitter, the faces black with a smoky grime, and pinched with pain and hunger, the long, matted hair and almost fleshless frame swarming with lice - gave us some idea that a like fate awaited us on the inside.\"  Sadly, this soldier could not have been more right."," The prisoners were not provided with shelter, and were only given very meager rations.  No cooking utensils were provided, nor was there any wood for burning fires to cook their food.  The only water for the entire camp was located at the center of the compound, and was also used as an outdoor latrine, which laid the foundation for countless diseases to fester and grow.  Also, a death line was drawn around the camp, and any prisoners who crossed this line were shot immediately.  Many times, the guards would shoot for no apparent reason, leading to the death of a number of innocent men.  One confederate guard appealed to the president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis, to stop the violence.  He wrote, \"They think killing of a yankee will make them great men, they shoot prisoners, alleging they crossed the dead line.  I know you are opposed to such measures, and I make this statement to you to be a soldier, a statesman, and a Christian.\""," In 1864, the death tolls at Camp  Sumter were astonishing.  In the month of August, one in eleven prisoners died.  In September and November, one in three died, and in October, a shocking fifty percent of the prisoners at Andersonville passed away.  By the end of 1864, almost 14,000 of the supposed 33,000 prisoners held at Camp  Sumter had fallen victim to the horrible conditions they lived in.  Conditions in Union prisons were much the same, and by the end of the war, some 56,000 prisoners had lost their lives to disease and starvation.  This number of deaths in prisons during the civil war eclipsed the total number of United  States' deaths in the entire conflict in Vietnam in the 1960s."],"display_date":"April 1, 1864 - April 1, 1865","search_date":"1864-09-30","locations":[{"id":2222,"lat":32.0447139452,"lng":-84.1951910375,"zoom":10,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4029,"title":"Faith during the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-29","end_date":"1863-08-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1863 Priscilla Munnikhuysen Bond wrote in her personal diary about the hardships the Civil War brought upon her. Bond wrote regularly about her faith and how the \"Lord [will] direct our ways and grant we may follow them.\" Although a Maryland native, Bond moved to Louisiana in 1861 because of her husband Howard Bond's service in the Confederate Army. His departure invoked many of the religious passages in her diary as she used religion as a comfort and a way to calm her fears. Bond often prayed to God in that she \"may not be entirely cut off from [her] husband,\" and that \"the cruel enemy may be driven from our soil.\" Her prayers to \"put a stop shortly to this miserable war\" were her comfort, and God, she believed, would answer those prayers.  Religious belief was how Bond coped, and she held her beliefs close. Even through illness, which was common throughout her diary, Bond remained religious.  Sickness fell to Bond and almost all around her but she \"believe[d] [she was] perfectly resigned to God's Will...as though He will spare [her]...but if it is God's wish to take [her], He knows best.\" ","The effects of the Second Great Awakening could still be seen 30 years later. As Samuel S. Hill states in the <em>Encyclopedia of Religion,</em> \"Evangelicalism crossed the lines of time...because it so easily expressed the protest and hopes of ordinary people.\" Protestant religion was an especially important factor in antebellum culture and religion was, as historian Randall Miller states, \"at the center of the American Civil War experience.\" ","The Protestant Baptist religion was very popular among white women like Bond. Evangelicals believed that the Bible was their guide and their actions must follow the Bible. In Bond's case, she strongly believed in the teachings of the Bible and believed that her prayers would be answered. According to Miller, \"Americans believed God was on the side of those who were right with Him,\" and Bond believed he was with her.  In order to live a good life, Protestants like Bond tried their best to follow the teachings of their savior. Prayer was her salvation from the horrors of war and illness, and she believed God would reward her in the afterlife. On August 34, 1863, Bond prayed, \"Oh, I do pray the good Lord will grant me this prayer-that I once more may visit the place of my nativity.\" She arrived home, in Maryland on January 2, 1866 and died shortly after.

Though he was not the founding father with the same name, this John Adams led an equally compelling life as a free black contractor and plasterer in Richmond.  He was also one of the extremely few African Americans in the South who owned a substantial amount of property before the Civil War.  Now, seven and a half years after Appomattox, John Adams was dead.  Sensing its approach, he filled out his will on January 8, 1873, just six days before his demise.  In his will, before laying out his possessions, he stated that he wished his debts to be paid.  Everyone immediately swooped in on John's son Joseph, the new holder of the Adams estate.  Barely a month after the loss, a mister Samuel Adams, with the leverage of a justice of the peace, forced Joseph to cover a debt of 73.50, rather paltry in light of the Adams family's wealth.   ","Life for Adams was not typical of that for a typical free black person in the antebellum South.  While many lived in cities like Richmond, they were often low-wage laborers who competed with poor whites.

Ayers in <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, \"in the decades after emancipation the prison populations of the Southern States had burgeoned with black men convicted of property crimes.\" Newspapers perpetually published reports of African American criminals, murderers, and prisoners.

The simple fact that George Fagan died a natural death, and not at the hands of an angry mob or corrupt officers, was a significant finding in the coroner's evaluation. Despite the evidence that Virginia had one of the lowest lynching rates in the South, the peak period of black lynching occurred during the early 1880s. Often white citizens would take justice into their own hands and carry out a sentence that the courts had not dictated.

Previously, people did not know the cause of cholera, but by the 1860s, public health officials suspected dirty water to be the source of the disease spreading and the new public sanitary measures reflected this. The Board of Health ordered that certain lots, some privately owned, be filled with dirt to prevent standing water from accumulating.  Also, the Board expected all householders to clean their property every day and their gutters at least twice a week.  Furthermore, all docks were to be cleaned and all accumulating shells, mud, filth and decaying wood were to be cleared every day so that no area had less than two feet of water at any time.

His speech was a direct attack on drunkenness and the dangers it entailed.  Dr. Scholfield began his speech with the remark, \"It is well authenticated, that many habitual drinkers of ardent spirits are brought to their end by what is called 'spontaneous combustion.'\" He then told of a young man under his care, who at just 25 years old had been a habitual drinker for many years.  The doctor was summoned at approximately 11:00pm by the local blacksmith and arrived to find the young man \"literally roasted from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet.\"  The young drunkard had been found burning inside the blacksmith's shop, looking like the wick of a burning candle.  Nothing else in the shop was on fire; and there was no damage to anything, it was \"simply a case of spontaneous combustion.\"  ","    The doctor then began to explain, in gory detail, the path the man took to his death.  \"His flesh was consumed or removed in the dressing, leaving the bones and a few of the larger blood vessels standing.\" Thirteen days later, the young man died an excruciating death, his screams and laments were said to have unsettled even the most hardened men.  In his death throes, the young man screamed out that \"he felt no pain of the body, for his flesh was gone. He was suffering the torments of hell; that he was just upon the threshold and should soon enter its dismal caverns.\"  Dr. Scholfield concluded his story with this remark: \"I have seen other drunkards die, but never in a manner so awful and affecting.  They usually go off senseless and stupid.\"","    By the early nineteenth century, temperance societies began springing up across the Untied States, in protest to the drunkenness running rampart throughout the country.  Although alcohol was not made illegal until the eighteenth amendment was passed in 1920, temperance societies began to grow in popularity as early as the 1790's.  By 1831, when Dr. Scholfield's article was published in the Western Luminary, a religious periodical, there were more than 8,000 American Temperance Society chapters across the country.  Speeches like the one given by Dr. Scholfield were an attempt to convert more people to the way of temperance and the avoidance of spirits.  Although scare tactics such as those used by Dr. Scholfield worked on some people (mainly women and devout individuals), the majority of the American public largely ignored such stories of spontaneous combustion. The consumption of spirits was a vital part of society and because of this, it was impossible for many people to imagine life without them.  The large change about the use of spirits came after the American Civil War, when the abuse of alcohol by veterans in both the north and south helped bring about a change in the way people viewed its destructive nature.

Dr. Smith was horrified to see so many helpless poor Russian children die and he realized that all countries should get together to make water cleaner and try to figure out a cure.

The cholera epidemic affected tens of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands more around the world. The cholera epidemic spread because technology had not yet been invented to help clean water.  Most of the articles about cholera were about dying families and commenting on how water must be cleaner.

The statement is only one of many Hardy presents in his 1887 book, <em><u>Oranges and Alligators</u></em>, that illustrates the verbal abuse other U.S. regions heaped on Florida. In defense of the state, Hardy wrote about the exotic nature and beauty of Florida that he discovered on his own journeys through the area. ","            Hardy relays an interesting personal story in this document about the assumption that Florida was malaria ridden. While Hardy was traveling in Orlando, one man in his group fell ill with a high fever and aching pains. The group assumed he had contracted malaria. In response one gentleman said, \"Malaria?...He can't have malarial fever, for there is no malaria here-Unless, he has been imprudent enough to be out-of-doors after sunset.\" ","            Insurance companies were as particular then as they are now. To the Hardy group's dismay, they discovered that because of the risk of malaria, most insurance companies declined to provide life insurance below a latitude line of 30° south. At that time the group was traveling considerably below 29° south. The rumor that malaria was rampant in Florida was not entirely false. Gordon Patterson's scientific journal stated that mosquitoes bred well in the many bodies of water covering the state. It took a yellow fever epidemic in 1888, one year after the publication of Hardy's book, for the government of Florida to develop a board of health for disease control. ","            Alligators were a big attraction for Florida tourists in 1887, just as they are today. While Hardy was traveling by Lake Maitland, a young man in his group heard of an alligator that had been spotted by the bank of a lake near a neighborhood. The young man, thinking it was dangerous, found it, shot it, and brought it home to display. Soon after, a resident wrote him a letter, saying he had, in fact, slaughtered a pet alligator the resident had raised from a baby. Hardy's description of the whole scene includes the observation that at the time, alligators were popular domestic pets in South Florida. Hardy also states that it was possible to mail an alligator to the North (alive, unless it died in the process); all it took was a box to put it in. Promoters pushed alligators as ideal domestic pets; they only needed to be fed once a week."],"display_date":1887,"search_date":"1887-07-02","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"United States History to 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":9,"school_id":5}},{"id":4218,"title":"Cyclone Ravages Charleston\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-08-24","end_date":"1828-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the early morning of August 25th, 1885, dark clouds began to roll in over Charleston.

The weather grew steadily worse throughout the night, and the storm from the Atlantic Ocean moved in.  According to one Charleston resident, \"Looking out into the gloom during the closing hours of the night and the early hours of the morning, the eye encountered a scene never to be forgotten, and which the beholder would scarcely care to see twice.

Electrical wires covered the streets, trees lay across the roads, and water stood knee deep all around the city.  In the words of McKinley, \"The brave, beloved city which had been swept by fire, stormed at with shot and shell, and occupied by a hostile army, within a quarter of a century, had now been buffeted for hours by raging seas, and shaken to its foundations by the most fearful storm that has ever visited our coasts within the knowledge of man.\"","          Winds in the storm reached an astounding 125 miles per hour, and the cyclone claimed the lives of twenty-one people.  Ninety percent of the private homes in the city were damaged, and about one fourth had the roofs torn away.  In the week after the storm, approximately 10,000 cartloads of debris were removed from the city streets.  The damages began to add up, and the cost of the destruction exceeded two million dollars.  Interestingly, the storm destroyed the city's gas lamps, but instead of funding a project to begin to adopt electricity in the city, Charleston officials continued their contract with the Charleston Gas Light Company, which had more local investors than its competitors in the electricity market.

As one of the survivors of this horrible episode in history, she wrote a letter to Levi Fosdick on May 22 of the following spring recounting her experiences.  Her concluding remark was \"I have told the bad news, and bad as it is I have told the best.  No tongue can exceed in description the reality.\"","            Mary Ann Graves, along with her large family of twelve, left for California in the fall of 1846 and joined with the Donner Party, bringing the total number of the party to 81.  Reaching the mountains later in the year than anticipated, the emigrants were forced to make camp because the snow rendered the trail impassable.  Mary Ann remained in the camp from November 4 until December 16, where they barely survived on \"poor beef.\"  She and fourteen others left to seek help for the starving and desperate emigrants on the sixteenth of December.  On the eighth day of their fifty mile journey, the small party got lost in the snow-covered mountains.  Completely out of food, the men of the party had no choice but to kill two of the Indians traveling with them.  For the rest of the journey, they lived off of the meat of their former companions and acorns.  Mary Ann's father died Christmas night.  They finally reached the settlements on January 18, but only seven out of the original fifteen members of the party saw this day.

The Commission focused on the details of Union soldier's imprisonment during their service. The soldiers gave testimony as to their experience as a prisoner of war. The compilation of accounts details the suffering and privations of different soldiers both commissioned and non-commissioned officers. ","            Private Joseph Grider was sworn in and examined in Virginia by the Commission. He detailed his survival from both the Libby and Danville Prisons operated by the Confederate States of America. The main discussion elaborated on the health of Private Grider and the conditions in which he was held. Grider detailed the rations allotted to himself and his fellow prisoners of war; the main storyline revolved around the bread ration, a staple in the diet of Civil War soldiers. The bread was rough with whole grains; when he was moved to Danville he received black bread made of cane seed. Grider discussed the deterioration of his health as a result of the food rations and inadequate housing. The prisoners suffered from diarrhea and other ailments. One other area of interest from Grider's testimony involves the severity of punishment enforced by the Confederate guards; during his stay at Danville seven men were shot for out the window. Other punishments involved the holding of men in chambers until they 'fouled on the floor.'","            Another testimony from Private Robert Morrison detailed the differences between Richmond, Pemberton, and Danville Confederate Prisons. Similar to Grider, he discussed the loss of personal items and the deprivation of clean and warm shelter during his early experiences in the prisons. The deprivation of healthy and clean food was another problem for Private Morrison. He noted the decline in his health as coinciding with his entrance into the prisoner of war encampments. Prior to his capture he did not have problems with diarrhea or fever; sickness did not take hold upon Morrison until he began eating the rations given to him by Confederate guards. Unlike Grider's testimony, Morrison detailed his final living quarters as warm, spacey with endless amounts of food and also access to a 'privy.' ","            The similarities between these two privates testimony is parallel when it comes to their experiences with food rationing. In many instances they expressed their opinion that it was contaminated or perhaps undercooked. Private Morrison stated, \"I got a chunk of corn bread daily...sometimes it was about half baked.\"  Dr. Joseph Jones, a witness in trial against Henry Wirz, 'formerly the commandant of the interior of the Confederate States military prison at Andersonville', shared this hypothesis stating, \"As far as my experience extends, no person who had been reared on wheat bread, and who was held in captivity for any length of time, could retain his health and escape either scurvy or diarrhea, if confined to the Confederate ration (issued to the soldier in the field and hospital) of unbolted corn meal and bacon.\" ","            Interestingly enough, Confederate law decreed that all prisoners should have access to the same privilege and food rations as the Confederate Soldiers; this act was acknowledged by General Robert E. Lee himself in a letter to a relative stating, \"The laws of the Confederate Congress and the orders of the War Department directed that the rations furnished prisoners of war should be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy, and that the hospitals for prisoners should be placed on the same footing as other Confederate States hospitals in all respects.\" Whether this was an act of forbearance or an act of compassion it is easy to see, Union soldier in Confederate prisons suffered through disease and desperation similarly. Although this was an act in effect, prisons in the South failed to comply with all its' standards and requirements. William Best Hesseltine pointed out that the closing of the summer of 1863 brought about the halt of a cartel in which prisoners from both sides of the war were exchanged; this halt increased the number of mouths to feed and also the growing debt of the Confederacy. Prisoners in southern camps suffered the consequences of this halt. Hesseltine remarked that the quality and quantity of rations for prisoners especially at Libby prison decreased markedly as the days passed by and yet the officers continued to enjoy luxuries such as apples, sugar, eggs, molasses, and corn."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4292,"title":"A Seemingly Normal Day for President James Garfield\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-02","end_date":"1881-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["1 Gearing up for the 4th of July President James Garfield's itinerary for the weekend is printed in the Washington Post this morning.

The President's train will depart from the Baltimore and Potomac Depot at 9:30 A.M. this morning. ","            Garfield was originally elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican from the state of Ohio.  He immediately distinguished himself as a very competent and likable person.  His tendency to try to please everyone helped him win the Republican Presidential nomination in 1880 but would eventually hinder him during his presidency.  ","            2 On the morning of July 2, 1881 President Garfield made his way to his executive train car in the Baltimore and Potomac Depot. On the way he was shot twice from behind by Charles J, Guiteau.  Garfield would later become ill from infection and eventually died two months later on September 19, 1881.  Garfield's Vice President, Chester A. Arthur, was sworn into office the next day.  Garfield had only been in office for four months before he was mortally wounded.  Only William Henry Harrison had a shorter term in office. "," 3Ironically the most lasting legacy of James Garfield is the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 which passed 3 years after his death.  The civil service reform movement capitalized on the assassination by a \"deranged office seeker\" by blaming the spoils system for Garfield's death.  The Pendleton Act has had a significant effect on the civil services in the United   States.  It forced presidents to make appointments based on merit instead of patronage.  This helped eliminate corrupt practices inherent in the spoils system and also made the civil services more efficient because the new appointments were better educated and more experienced.

The result was the needless deaths of thousands of men on both sides due to malnourishment, lack of medical care, and abuse by prison guards.  But one set of prisoners fared slightly better than the other.","In a documented 1876 interview, Dr. R. Randolph Stevenson spoke of a provision in the Confederate Constitution for captured Union soldiers. The provision says, \"and the rations furnished for prisoners of war shall be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished to enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy.\"  Union prisons did not uphold such guarantees.  Many Confederate prisoners were denied basic needs by a nation with all kinds of resources.  The Confederacy on the other hand even went so far as to sell valuable supplies in order to feed and care for captured Union soldiers.","Indeed, many surgeons commented on the poor health of returned rebel soldiers. Those diseased souls spoke of abuse and neglect at the hands of their captors.  It was not uncommon for prisoner trade barges to contain the bodies of dead and dying persons.  Some prisoners spoke of being placed in prisons where disease like Small Pox ran rampant and medical aid was denied. Such accounts were collected and published after the war by historians.  Such stories seem at odds with the fact that the Union had funds available to improve the health and well being of captured rebels.","The Confederacy, on the other hand, made sure it upheld its belief in equal treatment of captured soldiers.  When money became scarce within the Confederate prison system, cotton and tobacco were sold to provide additional funding. When disease began to ravage prisoners, Confederate officers tried to barter with Union commanders for medical supplies, only to be rebuffed.  Accounts of favorable treatment and hospitality by Confederate prisons came from men like Mr. John F. Frost of Folgers Company 19th Maine.","In some circumstances, Union soldiers were held prisoners inside hospitals, while Confederate troops were held in makeshift camps.  The unequal treatment of captured soldiers by the two sides stands in contrast to the readily accepted notion that Union soldiers were treated much worse than Confederate troops.  This is perhaps the belief because of northern propaganda like \"Report 67.\" A renamed Congressional report on Confederate prisons based on conditions of soldiers and not on testimonials of POWs.   However, the truth is eventually revealed, and the light shone on the misdeeds of others.

Finally on July 4, 1862 Surgeon General Tripler was removed from his position and he was replaced by Jonathon Letterman. Letterman, the man for whom the plan was named after, was the official organizer of the new system. ","            This Order from McClellan was implemented a month prior to Antietam, the bloodiest single battle of the war, and also provided great service in the Battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg for the Army of the Potomac. After the Battle of Fredericksburg, Surgeon Charles R. Leary issued a statement in his official report claiming, \"During the engagements of the 13th, the ambulances being guided and governed with perfect control and with a precision rare even in military organizations, the wounded were brought without any delay or confusion to the hospitals of their respective divisions.\"","             Order No. 147 established a strong system of order for use in a chaotic atmosphere. The success of the Order led to the adoption of the Ambulance Corps into the Army of Tennessee by Grant. Ultimately this order led to an approval of the system by President Lincoln on March 11, 1864; Congress passed the Uniform System of Ambulances act which standardized an ambulance system for all military forces.

The article continued to claim, \"the value of such sanitary care was particularly tested in 1878, when the disease was very fatal in Memphis, Shreveport, and in Texas.\" In the wake of numerous epidemics of yellow fever, cholera, and the like, people throughout the country called for sanitary reform and regulation. The rapid urbanization experienced during the nineteenth century had highlighted the insufficient methods for disposing of waste and refuse. As exclaimed in the <em>New York Daily Times</em>: \"we need nothing but noses to know that there is something rotten in the street.\"","The initial push for sanitary reform came in the 1840s, yet would not culminate in any significant changes until the 1870s and 1880s. In the early stages of urban development, city-dwellers practiced private-lot waste removal, in which, as Peterson describes, they \"discharged their wastes upon the land adjoining their dwellings and shops, principally within the confines of the private lot but also into the streets.\" In reaction to similar problems in England during the 1840s, British reformer Edwin Chadwick developed an innovative system of water-carriage sewerage, in which pressurized water was passed through small, egg-shaped pipes to carry solid wastes away from the city. Chadwick also accepted the filth theory, which held \"that gases or miasmas emanating from decaying organic matter caused disease.\" However, not much progress was made in sanitary reform in America before the Civil War; as Peterson remarks, \"only Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Chicago, in fact, attempted major works before the Civil War. Not until after the war and the return of cholera in 1866 did many cities introduce systematic sewerage.\" At that point, American pioneers followed Chadwick's suit, installing comprehensive and integrated sewer systems in major cities across the nation. Legislation was passed to provide for the administrative reform of sanitation. Boards of Health began cropping up in cities around the country. The American Public Health Association, which Peterson claims, \"became the principal voice of American sanitary reform,\" was formed in 1872. Sanitary survey planning emerged as a useful practice, as it \"required the study of every street, lot, and building in a city to determine the precise location of any prevalent and all suspect environmental conditions.\"     ","The impact of American sanitary reform was most readily observed in the comprehensive reconstruction plan developed for Memphis, Tennessee in response to a devastating yellow fever epidemic in 1878, which claimed 5,150 lives out of its population of approximately 45,000. A National Board of Health was created in March 1879 to deal with the problem. It conducted an exhaustive, citywide survey and made nine proposals to improve the city's sanitation. George E. Waring was chosen to construct an innovative and controversial sewage system in the city. According to the <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>, Waring's \"pipes were much smaller than customary, were for house sewage only, without manholes, well ventilated, and were flushed every twenty-four hours by means of automatic flush tanks.\" Although the plan only pertained to health matters and not to the city's future growth, the sanitary reform conducted in Memphis considerably improved the city's sanitation and proved to be a significant step towards the eventual practice of city planning. ","However, in the 1880s and 1890s, German and French bacteriologists soon discovered the microscopic pathogenic organisms responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera, among others. Peterson states, \"As this new public health approach gradually took hold, it shifted attention away from the root premise of sanitary reform - that most infectious disease had its source in the visible environment.\" Thus, preventative measures such as isolation, immunization, disinfection, and antitoxins became more important than sanitary reform. Sanitary scientists developed methods of filtration and chlorination of water, allowing polluted water to become purified. Although sanitary reform eventually lost momentum in the face of microorganisms and filtration, the movement sparked valuable innovations in sewerage and city planning as methods to control the byproducts of urbanization during the nineteenth century.

In 1861, at the age of twenty-one, Cooper enlisted in the 77th Pennsylvania. Cooper saw first hand the effects of diseases and injuries on an army. In his letter to Lieutenant George D. Schott, Cooper wrote that he had gotten over a fever fairly well but was still suffering from bad Rheumatism.  He also did not know what had happened to some of his comrades and was very worried about them, so asked Schott to let him know if they were alright. Cooper wrote, \"Let me know If James Is Sick or If there Is anything Happened him and If there Has Let me know If there Is any Letters Send them to me the Boys are all Getting Better.\"","Civil War doctors were not very experienced and their patients and the press often referred to them as \"butchers\".

They both had a classical education, taught by their mother and live-in tutors, and both enjoyed reading and writing.","They lived a content, carefree existence, hunting, fishing, and \"galloping around the country,\" but there easy, hard working life was not to last. The threat of this new war loomed and Maurice, at 17, joined the army of the Confederacy, followed by his father and lastly, his brother Will Henry. Thompson served in the 4th Georgian Infantry, and served in the Confederate army throughout the War.","His poem, \"The High Tide at Gettysburg\" is different from poems of wars from previous authors, as it is of an \"elegiac strain.\" The poem is definitely in tune with the mid-nineteenth-century \"preoccupation with mortality and morality,\" which makes sense as Will Henry would have been very young when he joined up, and still young when he wrote and published this work in 1888. It begins with the much repeated lines, \"a cloud possessed the hollow field, the gathering battle's smoky shield. Athwart the gloom the lightning flashed, and through the cloud some horsemen dashed, and from the heights the thunder pealed.\" From this verse, the poem could be about any battle, or even any of the many Gettysburg battles, but it is not much later that Thompson mentions Pickett, and \"leading grandly down,\" implying that this poem is about Pickett's Charge, the final surge of the Confederacy and Lee to push north. As we know, Lee failed and in the process many thousands died at the Battle of Gettysburg.","It is written without poetic flourish, and fluffy language; Thompson created a smoke filled atmosphere with guns and flashes and death surrounding it all. The reader of this poem is taken to Pickett's Charge, and shown in no uncertain terms that the war was gruesome and horrific, that men died, and for leaders who had almost forgotten the original cause. Thompson compared the fight to the fiery losses of the British at Waterloo, and shows how straggled the Confederates are by 1863, by discussing the colours or the battle flags. He writes \"Virginia heard her comrade [Tennessee] say: 'Close round this rent and riddled rag',\" and a little later, he says the \"tattered standards of the South,\" both double entendres, as they don't just mean the actual flags are torn and full of holes, but the Confederates and the South as a whole, is tattered and torn, and full of holes.","The famous lines \"they smote and stood, who held the hope of nations on that slippery slope,\" has been attributed the first use of Slippery Slope, by language specialists and the surprise is that here it is literally slippery from blood, but now means something different. The last verse is beautiful, with Thompson changing tack slightly, using love as a reason to stop fighting, and finishing with the image of a mother \"lamenting all her fallen sons\" This is possibly why Colonel Will Henry Thompson was commissioned to prepare \"proper wording\" for Edgar Allen Poe's mother's epitaph. He wrote similar words of a mother leaving someone very special behind.

","Little was known about yellow fever, especially ways to prevent or treat this disease. Almost annually, it seemed, the Gulf Coast and in particular, New Orleans, suffered mass outbreaks of the fever and any aid that could be offered from doctors in surrounding areas was much appreciated. Municipal medical examiners in New Orleans were quick in issuing licenses to practice medicine to refugee doctors, including Christian Miltenberger. While during his time in St. Domingue, serving as a surgeon for a British garrison, Miltenberger treated many cases of yellow fever and was well equipped to handle the outbreaks in New Orleans. ","With his experience in dealing with yellow fever, the Mayor of New Orleans saw great potential in Miltenberger and appointed him to supervise indigent health care for the Mayor's district. Miltenberger also had the opportunity to present a paper before the Medical Society of New Orleans in 1819, theorizing that yellow fever was not a contagious disease, thus changing the understanding and reaction to the outbreaks of yellow fever.","With this great influence on the medical community came great reputation for Miltenberger. He was an active mason and served as president of a commission to raise funds for the construction of a Masonic hospital in the city of New Orleans. Miltenberger also acted on an opportunity to merge 120 acres of his property with 320 acres owned by Madame Joseph Bayle, creating a rather large sugar plantation just outside of New Orleans. After buying her out three years later, Miltenberger became one of the wealthiest men in New Orleans, and by far the most reputable St. Domingan refugee in New Orleans.

At the time, no one knew exactly where the sparks had ignited and the fire begun, but by Thursday afternoon, the flames had engulfed approximately seventeen square blocks on and surrounding Wall Street. An article in the magazine The Albion indicated that by Thursday evening between 700 and 1000 buildings in the financial district, many only five or six years old, had been damaged.  Firefighters desperately attempted to extinguish the flames, but the unusually cold weather was accompanied by high winds.  As a result, flames quickly spread and water hoses froze, making the job near impossible.  Finally, fire companies chose to collect gunpowder from Navy Yards nearby and demolish buildings in the path of the fire to prevent it spreading to other parts of the city.","The final estimate suggested New Yorkers lost the equivalent of fifteen million dollars in private property during the fifteen hour fire. Insurance companies holding policies on many of the city's downtown buildings were ruined, some able to pay only twenty-five to fifty cents on the dollar in benefits.  Remarkably, shipping facilities along the river's banks remained safe from major damage.  Yet New York lay in ruins, and local officials sent in militias to protect against looting and damage over the coming weekend.  \"The arm of man was powerless…\" a journalist wrote, \"and many of our fellow citizens who retired to pillows in affluence, were bankrupts upon awaking.\"","New York had grown quickly in the early nineteenth century, and as the city expanded, fire companies, which had served as social clubs to many property owners in the past, now became associations for the poorer and much larger working classes of the American city.  Not only did these companies grow rapidly (some individual companies exceeding memberships of 300), but they became rallying points of community loyalty, oftentimes based on ethnicity. The result was fierce rivalry between the companies themselves.  In Philadelphia, for example, Irish Catholic and Irish Protestant companies raced horse-drawn hose carriages through the streets en route to a fire while in the process sabotaging one another's equipment, disabling truck wheels and cutting tow lines.  Competition between rival companies would often become so fierce that riots began.  In New York, as in Philadelphia, this trend only worsened as time went on, as some companies carried overlapping memberships with community gangs that could lead to further violence.

Progressive reformers believed that high infant mortality was linked to adulterated and infectious milk, a concern that remained even after New York passed regulation laws. On March 25, 1913, the Committee of Women's Organizations of the New York Milk Committee held a meeting to educate mothers living in the tenements of the Lower East Side on the importance of \"pure\" milk and of clean living areas. Dr. Lee W. Thomas, a member of the New York Milk Committee, encouraged the mothers to get milk from New York Health Department milk stations, to keep clean homes, and to influence their husbands to vote for the passage of pure milk bills, which were introduced to the New York Legislature by the Milk Committee. After Dr. Thomas spoke to the mothers, films were shown to illustrate the dangers of impure milk.","During the mid-nineteenth century, most of New York's milk supply came from \"swill\" milk stables attached to breweries and distilleries in the city. The cows in these stables ate the leftover grains from the fermentation process in the brewery or distillery. Unfortunately, the milk produced from these stables was very low quality and often full of bacteria. Even milk brought to the city from the country was often adulterated with water and carrying bacteria. In 1842, social reformer Robert Hartley published his <em>Essay on Milk</em>, which both praised milk as the \"perfect food\" and argued the importance of pure milk in New York City. Though New York City began to pass milk regulations in 1856, milk continued to be a concern for social reformers as a potential carrier of germs and diseases. Milk reform was part of a larger reform movement to regulate food, drink, and drugs, a movement that eventually resulted in the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906, which made it illegal to adulterate or mislabel food or drugs. This put the power of information and choice in the hands of consumers, most of whom were women. Thus, even after this law was passed, social reformers felt impelled to guide tenement mothers in the importance of choosing good quality milk and keeping a clean home.","One of the means used by Progressive reformers, eager to use new technology, to preach cleanliness was moving pictures. Though this is an early instance of moving pictures being used as health propaganda, it is not the first. Three years before this meeting, Thomas Edison made a series of health propaganda films for the Tuberculosis Association.

The poem followed the coffin throughout the country where you could see the remains of the devastation caused by the Civil War. The country women were still mourning for their own family members. They seemed ready to mourn for their president, as they were already wearing black veils and the images of past battles haunted men's thoughts. The poet addressed his despair, not knowing how to mourn such a leader properly. Was he to mourn like he would for a family member? A part of the country was disoriented by this assassination, only adding to the trouble caused by the new situation of the country after the Civil War. The poem itself seemed to show that even nature was disturbed by the death of Lincoln and willing to honor the president.

The prison was overcrowded with prisoners crammed in rooms, inactive and secluded from society, lacking food, exercise and fresh air. The atmosphere was so polluted that people could hardly breathe. The promiscuity made sickness spread in a heartbeat, and in the winter of 1865, the prison witnessed an epidemic of what was called hospital gangrene, in addition to the usual scourges of diarrhea, dysentery and scorbutus. The assistant surgeon of the hospital reported that the epidemic was due to all these factors. Gangrene started from a bacterial infection in a wound and could spread to the whole body and eventually kill the patient if not handled in time. In the hospital, out of 325 patients, 208 died over the three months before January. Usually gangrene could be handled easily, but the hospital was so over-burdened and not prepared to medical care, that far more people died than typical. The patients of the prison's hospital formed a crew of 1,600 to 2,000 people, who slept in tents, with at least five other persons. They wore their battle clothing that they had not washed in six months or more. In their state, they needed strong food that could give them strength, but the hospital could not provide it for them. The medicines that the hospital received lasted only for ten days, and then they had to accommodate with what they could, such as vegetables picked in nature around the hospital. They were in such a lack for medicine that they had to carry out experiments on the patients, out of natural plants that they picked up in the countryside.

According to Freemon, hospital gangrene was a sickness in which skin tissues became black, and it happened only in certain hospitals, due to horrific sanitary conditions. He believed that the hands of the surgeons themselves could be responsible for the spread of the disease from a wound to the other. In Catton and McPherson's view, the living conditions were atrocious and the death rates were alarmingly high.

Lerchenmuller resided in a Veteran’s Administration psychiatric ward due to the concern of a judge who had sentenced him to a psychiatric hospital instead of prison on the grounds that “it would be silly to put someone like him behind bars. With his history, you knew he could kill himself.”","Whether called Combat Fatigue, Shell Shock, or War Neurosis,these terms all refer back to the same thing: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder<em>. </em>Caused by exposure to traumatic events that threatened injury or death, the soldiers of theVietnam War experienced high levels of severe psychological strain. Throughout the sixteen years the war lasted soldiers had to fight an enemy they often could not see while they watched men dying all around them. At the end of the war over fifty-eight thousand men had died fighting the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army. Five hundred thousand would return home, only to learn that PTSD had impeded their readjustment in post-war America.","The men who survived and returned to the lives they left behind sometimes found their world changed. The veterans would relive their days in Vietnam through the nightmares and flashbacks to the war they endured. Much like soldiers in earlier conflicts, PTSD had appeared again. Affected by alcoholism or drug abuse, relationship deterioration, or other physical and mental symptoms, Vietnam veterans even turned to suicide to solve their problems. According to a study completed by the Centers for Disease Control, Vietnam Veterans are twice as likely to contract PTSD symptoms when compared to other veterans."],"display_date":"December 2, 1983","search_date":"1983-12-02","locations":[{"id":39584,"lat":40.9100159753,"lng":-73.7674032747,"zoom":9,"place":"Westchester, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":4762,"title":"Charles Knowlton and <em>The Fruits of Philosophy</em>","course_id":40,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-01-01","end_date":"1832-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Charles Knowlton was one nineteenth century doctor who was not afraid to talk about sex. Despite prosecution and jail time he stood behind the ideas of his 1832 work <em>Fruits of Philosophy</em>. The book was deemed obscene for its discussion of sex for pleasure and birth control methods. Knowlton saw sexual desire as a passion that started in the nerves of the genital organs and extended to the brain. He saw sexual desire as natural, but realized that no “sensations” could be excited without causing some kind of negative reproduction. In the case of sex negative consequences included having children out of wedlock and contracting venereal diseases. However, Knowlton also believed that man was gifted with the ability to discover ways to prevent these negative occurrences. If mankind desired sexual gratification and could prevent the disagreeable aspects of engaging in such activity, Knowlton believed there was no reason not to engage.","He advocated the use of four types of “checks” to limit the negative consequences of sex. The first was entire withdrawal by the male. But this was not his preferred method due to the loss of some enjoyment. The second check was a sponge that had been dipped in chloride of soda and then inserted into the female’s vagina. This was agreeable since it was effective at managing venereal diseases. The third method was the use of a thin skin to cover the male sexual organ. This was objectionable on the basis of cleanliness and the expense for an item that is not reusable. The fourth check was what Knowlton advocated as the best option. This practice involved syringing the vagina directly after sex. It could be used after the sexual act, was very clean, and the materials were cheap and easily obtained.","The ideas put forth in <em>Fruits of Philosophy</em> were an innovation in the nineteenth century. This book was the first text published in the United States to deal with contraception from an empirical medical standpoint. As Knowlton published new editions of the book the descriptions of the anatomy of the sexual organs and their functions became more elaborate. The book represented cutting edge knowledge concerning women’s bodies and reproduction. Knowlton moved the discussion of sex from a moral issue to the realm of physiology. He was one of the founders of a framework that historian Helen Horowitz has called \"reform physiology,\" which was concerned with the functions of the reproductive organs and recommending healthy lifestyles. Sexual desire was then recognized as being part of the mind, in the communications between the nerves and the brain. The nineteenth century did see a decrease in the average number of children born to white women. Couples sought to have fewer children for reasons such as their new urban lifestyles, the sense of responsibility brought by the concept of republican motherhood, and ideas of romantic love that separated sex from conception. These goals could be achieved with the advice of doctors', such as Knowlton, describing how to prevent sex from resulting in birth."],"display_date":1832,"search_date":"1832-07-01","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":364,"tag":"sex"},{"id":362,"tag":"contraception"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Sex and Culture in the 19th-century United States","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":40,"school_id":2}},{"id":4778,"title":"Union Private Describes Raiders at Andersonville Prison","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-04-08","end_date":"1864-04-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1864, Robert Knox Sneden, a Union private and mapmaker, lived as a prisoner in the notorious Andersonville Prison. During his stay, Sneden kept a diary of the conditions and daily monotony of the captives. Occasionally he gave up trying to write a daily account and would lump his entries together by the week as he did from April 8 to 20, in 1864. This particular week, Sneden talked about a group of Union criminals within the prison known as “The Raiders.”","Andersonville was a Confederate prison that was originally designed in early 1864 to hold 10,000 Union prisoners of war. By April, the prison population had reached its capacity and continued to increase until August. Prisoners suffered from terrible burdens caused by overcrowding. These problems included unsanitary living conditions, an insufficient amount of Confederate supplies, and disease. Along with these horrible living conditions, prisoners also had to deal with the threat of being mugged and killed by these thieves.","Sneden first encountered the Raiders in April when one of his fellow prisoners was killed. On a foggy night, the group killed a prisoner with pine clubs and subsequently robbed him of his overcoat and money. Due to the fog, the Raiders were able to escape undercover. The scoundrels kept together and continued to steal from prisoners on foggy nights."," Sneden described the Raiders as a desperate set of thieves and murderers from the Belle Island prison camp located west of Richmond, Virginia in the James River. Most of them were from the slums of the cities and originally served time in prison before they listed in the Union army. Sneden expressed discontentment in saying “…no one’s life is safe among us as long as these Raiders have their own way.” To help each other fight, members lived in groups. Sneden added that “They are given a ‘wide berth’ and no right minded prisoner will venture into their quarters knowingly, as he is sure to be robbed of everything he has if he does.”"," To counter the Raiders, prisoners organized a police force known as “The Regulators.” This group of fifty or more of the largest and strongest men used club force to keep Raiders from attacking. Twenty of the men were to move about the camp during the day while twenty-five stood at important points at night to head off and club Raiders. A certain portion of each man’s ration was to be allotted to these men in order to keep them in shape for fighting. The chief of the Regulators, “Big Pete,” was to decide the cases among prisoners and lash them with the cat-o-nine-tails when they were found guilty."],"display_date":"April 8, 1864 - April 20, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-14","locations":[{"id":2222,"lat":32.0447139452,"lng":-84.1951910375,"zoom":10,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4838,"title":"Mrs. Robert E.

Lee passed away from pneumonia while surrounded by his family at home in Lexington, Virginia. General Lee gained celebrity from his service as a general in the Confederacy during the Civil War. The pneumonia followed a stroke that had occurred two weeks earlier. Despite death looming, Lee maintained composure that he accumulated over his lifetime during his last two weeks of life. Lee’s wife, Mary Anna Custis, described her husband’s last two weeks in a letter to a dear friend.","General Lee suffered a stroke on Wednesday, September 28, 1870 after attending a meeting at his church. He returned home to have tea with his awaiting family. Mary Custis Lee remarked “You have kept us waiting a long time. Where have you been?” He did not reply. Instead, he stood as if he was about to say grace, but he did not utter a word. Lee quietly sat back down in his seat with a breath of resignation. Mrs. Lee said “That look was never to be forgotten, and I have no doubt he felt that his hour had come…”","Doctors promptly arrived to aid the ailing Lee and remained by his side over the last two weeks of his life. Mary Custis explained that, “He never smiled and rarely attempted to speak, except in his dreams, and then he wandered to those dreadful battle-fields.” At one point, Lee began to feel better. A doctor said “You must soon get out and ride your favorite gray!” referring to his horse, Traveller. The General did not reply as he closed his eyes and shook his head emphatically. He was stubborn about taking his medicine, saying once to his daughter Agnes, “It’s no use,” even though he would always take it afterwards.","In his final hours, Lee slept a great deal. It became more certain to doctors and his family that his case was hopeless. His pulse stet weak and rapid as his breathing grew heavier. Despite his tiredness, he was still able to recognize his family, and he loved having them around, greeting them with all with a gentle press to their hands. Slightly after nine o’clock on the morning of October 12, he at last sank to rest as his eyes closed to the world. The old hero had lost his final battle as a deep sigh drew across his face. “What a glorious rest was in store for him!” said Mrs. Lee.","After death, Lee’s image was still resented by some Northerners because they viewed him as a traitor for siding with the Confederacy during the Civil War. For generations of Southerners, he became a symbol of the virtues of the Old South. At Washington College in Virginia, Lee served as president and publicly deprecated violence. After his death, the college changed its name to Washington and Lee College.

Previously soldiers that surrendered on the battlefield were often paroled. These soldiers were expected to return home and lay down their arms. However, often these men would return home then reenlist and fight the enemy again. Armies recognizing this problem placed punishments on soldiers who were captured violating their parole. Though these punishments were in place, there was really no efficient way to keep track of those who violated their parole, thus enemy prisoner of war camps were established. Although prisoners were placed in these camps, often treatment and conditions were so difficult that there was no guarantee that they would survive. The best example from the American Civil War is Andersonville prison camp Andersonville prisoners suffered so immensely that the camp’s commander was trailed and imprisoned for war crimes. Attaching blame to the commander was and is the obvious course of action, however, reviewing the history of the camp reveals different information.  Who is actually to blame?"," ","Howell Cobb, the commander of the military district Andersonville was located recognized the problem of overcrowding in the camp as early as May of 1864. “There are now in the prison twelve thousand prisoners…The effect of increasing number within the present area must be a terrific increase of sickness and death during the summer months.” So while the conditions suffered by Union soldier imprisoned with the walls of the were horrible, it was recognized by the Confederate administration that conditions were sub-standard."," ","So who is to blame? Many argue that is the responsibility of the commander of the camp. However, the commander was not allocated resources sufficient care for the number of prisoners interred at the camp. The Confederacy, when conditions at Andersonville were at their all time worst, barely had the resources to provide for armies in the field, so naturally, the amount of resources allocated to the commander of the camp extremely limited. Blame can be assigned ultimately by putting the situation in historical perspective."," ","Perspective is an interesting subject in regards to how the legacy of a particular event or place is viewed. Often, especially when the event or place is viewed negatively, blame shifts depending which side the reviewer takes. Pro-Union reviewers will place blame on the commander, or the Confederate government for the conditions suffered by the union detainees.  However, conversely pro-Confederate reviewers will place blame on the lack of resources across the Confederate states and will cite similar instances in camps located in Union territory for committing similar atrocities.

Still believed that he could gather statistical information that would be strong enough to refute claims of black inferiority by testing intelligence and gathering stories from those he had helped on the Underground Railroad.","Pennsylvania became a safe haven for blacks in the mid to late 1800s because of the increased involvement of private organizations and groups of people such as the Quakers.  Quakers in southeastern Pennsylvania helped an unknown number slaves reach freedom and refused to aid in the retrieval of escaped slaves, even after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the penalties that went along with it.  With the help from people such as Still, blacks would receive a warm welcome and a helping hand to freedom in the state.","William Still helped several slaves on their way to freedom through Pennsylvania.  He also did what he could to speak out about slavery and everything that he believed to be wrong with the institution.  Still was one of a group of pioneers in the United States who believed that slavery was not only atrocious but also completely immoral.  His work was all aimed towards the goal of ending slavery in the United States."],"display_date":"November 25, 1857","search_date":"1857-11-25","locations":[{"id":11229,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5402,"title":"Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment Examined by HEW","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"7/26/72","end_date":"7/26/72","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 26, 1972 <em>The Alton Evening Telegraph, </em>a newspaper in Alton, Illinois<em>, </em>released an article discussing The Department of Health Education and Welfare's investigation of the Tuskegee Syphilis experiment. Although the experiment was conducted in Alabama, the news was a national story. Jean Heller, the author of the article, found this study so disturbing that she decided to report on it. The experiment’s purpose was to study the effects of syphilis on the human body. The investigation was sparked because the participants of the study, 600 black men, were denied proper medical treatment for their ailments. Dr. Merlin K. Duval announced the investigation; he stated he wanted to investigate why the study lasted so long. The study started in 1932 and lasted until 1972. Public Health Service officials questioned the morality of the study because the study continued after penicillin had been proven to be the cure for the disease. While seeking subjects for the study Dr. Raymond Vonderlehr searched the largely illiterate, poverty-stricken population of sharecroppers and tenant farmers. The individuals participating in the study were all poor black males.","There were 600 participants divided into three groups: 200 not suffering from syphilis, 200 with the disease and treated with the best methods known at the time and 200 not treated for syphilis at all. After the investigation began the investigators determined that of the 400 men infected with syphilis none of them were treated. The pre-penicillin treatment for syphilis consisted mainly of arsenic and mercury injections, and a death rate of 1 in 100 was considered good. Dr. J.D. Millar, chief of the venereal disease branch of Atlanta's CDC, believed \"the moral problem, if any in 1932 was very vague because the risk of treatment was in the minds of physicians worse than the disease\". Millar is in charge of the remains of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.","In a 1968 Hastings Center Report, Allan Brandt stated that in retrospect the study \"revealed more about the pathology of racism than about the pathology of syphilis\". The study was widely reported without arousing any significant protest in the medical community. Brandt suggested that there needs to be more attentiveness in evaluating the specific ways in which social values and attitudes affect professional behavior. Heller agrees with Brandt because she suggests that racism was one of if not the only reason behind the study."],"display_date":"July 26, 1972","search_date":"1972-07-26","locations":[{"id":34382,"lat":38.8298808603,"lng":-89.9051581527,"zoom":9,"place":"Madison, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1237,"tag":"Tuskegee"},{"id":1238,"tag":"Syphilis"},{"id":1239,"tag":"Study"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5404,"title":"Study Shows Rates of Syphilis Higher for Poor Individuals","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"10/11/37","end_date":"10/11/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Charleston Gazette reported that poor individuals have higher instances of acquiring syphilis.

Not only is it a career, but also it is a way of life. That way of life was threatened by the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill. Over 80% of the protein in Alaskans’ diet comes from fish. They rely on seafood as a main source of food and they didn’t want to risk cancer or other organ damage. They also needed a good harvest to make a living. One fisherman told <em>the Globe and Mail</em> that the incident “took our resources and washed them down the sink.” Other local Alaskans worried about the clean up process and hoped that the oil company could indeed clean it and not leave the locals to suffer. Other fishermen fretted that it would change the $100 million industry by leaving fish that are not edible.","Early morning March 24, 1989 at 12:04 AM the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil tanker went aground on the Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. Over 260,000 barrels of oil spilled out of the 300 meter long, steel single hull, oil tanker. This created the most devastating human caused environmental catastrophe. The crude oil lay uncontained for twenty-four minutes before the accident was recorded. Seven hours after the spill, response teams tried attempted a dispersant test, but failed to contain the oil due to foul weather. It took Exxon thirty-six hours to finally put containment booms around Prince William Sound. Throughout the first week, efforts to clean the crude oil off the reef, beaches and affected animals began and would last over a year.","An environmental catastrophe as large as the<em> Valdez</em> oil spill, had a major impact on the local people, animals, and environment. Crude oil is toxic and a volatile compound and the fresh oil provided harsh fumes for the animals and workers to breathe. The effects of oil can be horrendous; contact of oil on skin, for example, can cause acute dermatitis. There were 350 sea otters that were rescued and only 180 of them survived. The ones who died had severe emphysema along with liver, kidney, intestinal, and bone morrow damage.","By the summer of 1990, the beaches were all cleaned up, but a high price was paid. Many animals were affected and the damage to fisheries still remains unknown. This massive, dangerous oil spill taught a lot of lessons. One of them is that single-skinned tankers should be phased out and the response to spills needs to be quicker and better prepared.

Pope’s bold design to evade the Confederate held Island No. 10 involved bypassing it by cutting a canal along the base of the northern “S” meander and directly connect the river areas between Island No. 8 and Island No. 9, along with New Madrid."," Engineers and an infantry regiment from Wisconsin devised ingenious tools to saw down trees below the level of the spring floodwaters. Some 600 soldiers eventually cleared a fifty-foot wide, eighty- mile long canal, taking about three weeks. With the Mississippi River being as unpredictable as it was, floodwaters would soon subside several inches a day after April 1, 1862, meaning that the tress that were cut at a higher mark would have to be cut again so the ships could pass. As Pope recalled, “To do this a cross-cut saw was attached, or rather was made the lower side of a triangle, the upper angle of which was fastened to the tree just at the water-line, and the depth from this point to the lower side of the triangle (the cross-cut saw) was about five feet.” With the canal completed on April 3, 1862, it was fully operable for ships and other vessels to use with the existing water levels of the Mississippi.","With the completion of the canal, on the stormy night of April 4, Captain Walke ran his gun boat, the <em>Carondolet</em>, past the battery of enemy troops on Island No. 10 untouched. Two nights later, Walke ordered his other ship, the <em>Pittsburg, </em>past the battery for Pope’s use. With these two ships, Pope intended to silence the battery on the bank called Watson’s Landing, in order to land troops for battle. On the morning of April 7, Pope ordered his men to open fire on the enemy using their ground battery and gunships to silence their weapons so he could land troops. According to Pope, “I at once communicated the fact to Paine and ordered him as soon as he effected a landing to leave a guard and push on himself with his command as rapidly to Tiptonville, to which point all the forces of the enemy were tending, assuring him that the rest of the troops would cross rapidly and be up with him soon.”","At about four o’clock in the morning on April 8, the Confederates evacuated Island No. 10 and were driven back to Reelfoot Swamp on the Tennessee side, unable to resist the Federals anymore.

They faced many struggles along the way including disease, thick mud, and broken roads, but the men pushed forward to the Confederate-held town. The Confederate General John McCown had caught wind of the movement of Pope’s divisions and decided to strengthen his defenses. McCown had a grand total of fifty-two pieces of artillery on his side, along with five foot thick bags of corn and dirt that could hold up to three regiments per fort. On March 3, Pope and his men set up their field guns in order to cut off Confederate communication, as well as to try to seal the fate of McCown’s remaining two forts.","On the night of March 11, the 10<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Illinois moved heavy artillery into place, about 800 yards from the Confederates lines, without the enemy knowing. Pope commanded Captain Mower, the Union siege gun commander, to concentrate fire on the C.S.A gunboats until they were silenced and then to batter the fortresses, in order to save ammunition. Confederate General McCown went into complete panic. He demanded that Polk and Beauregard give him 20,000 more men to fight because he thought that Pope had constructed an army of 50,000 soldiers, when he only had 12,000. On the evening of March 13, McCown realized that the heavy artillery that Pope’s men had brought through the swamps would lead to failure for his army. McCown, in defeat, told his leading commander Stewart to evacuate New Madrid and head to Tiptonville, Tennessee.","According to Pope, “A few minutes after daylight a flag of truce approached our lines with information that the enemy had hurriedly abandoned the works both below and above New Madrid, and been carried to the other shore of the river by gunboats.” The Union Army of the Mississippi defeated the Confederates with perseverance and dedication due to their fearless general, John Pope.

News of this exchange quickly spread among the Confederate prisoners held at Fort Delaware, although the more skeptical men pointed out the lack of evidence, and without further information, the discussion quieted. The rumor revived when a Union sergeant told an officer guarding prisoners there had been an exchange, and the federal government was arranging another. On August 17, 1864 a Union officer named Sergeant Murphy called six hundred names, all officers, who the prisoners believed would be the next group exchanged. One prisoner, John Ogden Murray, wrote: “When the M’s were called on the roll I could hardly contain myself; when my name was called I could have shouted for joy; and I really felt sorry that all my comrades were not included in the list, as we thought, for exchange.” When there was no movement from their guards the next day, the prisoners began thinking that the whole thing had been a cruel joke, until finally, at 3 p.m. August 20, 1864, roll was called again and the six hundred ordered to take their belongings and march onto the steamship <em>Crescent City</em> headed for Morris Island, South Carolina. After eighteen days, with only brief turns above deck, the ship arrived off Morris Island early in the morning of September 7, 1864. Unfortunately for the prisoners, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant sent a letter on August 21, 1864, specifically forbidding the exchange of the prisoners now at Morris Island. Prisoner exchanges were officially halted in July 1863, due to Confederate refusal to include black prisoners of war, but some generals continued arranging unofficial exchanges. By 10 a.m. September 7, 1864 the prisoners were informed there was no intention of exchanging them. The general who ordered the prisoners to Morris Island, Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, was retaliating for Union prisoners of war being placed in the parts of Charleston the Union was shelling. The battery on Morris Island was a target of the guns in Charleston, and he hoped the Confederates would be reluctant to fire on their own men. Although none of the prisoners died from the artillery, they were far from comfortable. Murray wrote that rations consisted of “the luxurious diet of four hardtack army crackers, one ounce of fat meat, and half a pint of sandy bean soup (which often tasted like it had been seasoned with soap).” The prisoners had to dig to the water table to get anything to drink. Three prisoners died on Morris Island of starvation-related illnesses. In early October 1864 a yellow fever outbreak in Charleston led the Confederates to remove their prisoners of war from the city, and in response Foster ordered the men, who would eventually be known as the Immortal 600, moved to Fort Pulaski at the mouth of the Savannah River.

Lawrence, quoted Edwards when she stated that she received the news from “several doctors” and they told her that “[Kennedy] would not be alive if it weren’t for cortisone.” After these accusations, Robert F. Kennedy, the Senator’s brother, stepped in and denied everything the Johnson supporters claimed. Robert F. Kennedy not only denied the fact that his brother had Addison’s Disease, but offered an explanation that is brother’s condition resulted from his “war time experiences.” JFK’s two doctors released a medical report basically clearing him “to hold any office to which [he] may aspire.” In truth, Kennedy relied on daily shots of steroids and cortisone, took amphetamines, and any other drug that would relieve his pain. Robert Dallek said, “Kennedy’s charismatic appeal rested heavily on the image of youthful energy and good health he projected.” John F. Kennedy lived with a serious disease without the public’s knowledge, and even when exposed by the press, he continued to hide his illness and battle for the presidency."],"display_date":"July 4, 1960 - July 5, 1960","search_date":"1960-07-04","locations":[{"id":52990,"lat":34.0522342,"lng":-118.2436849,"zoom":8,"place":"Los Angeles, CA, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.
