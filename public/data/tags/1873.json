Additionally, even though Democrats often sacrificed their political ideas for the war, they did not want to let the trend of a Republican-dominated government to continue after the war.","The article also sought to persuade readers of the righteousness of the Democratic view by comparing the election season to another battle in war. It stated, “Let not one man be left behind: get them all to the ranks and go to the polls determined, invincible, and in farness!” The Civil War had only been over for short six years at this point and such martial imagery still had the ability to move readers’ emotions.","The election of 1871, which is being described in the article, was not a presidential election year. Possible low Democratic participation in the 1871 election is described in the article as a large issue due to concern that if Democrats did not rally for a local election, then the trend would carry over into elections for years to come. This is stated in the <em>Watchman </em>as, “One or the other of these alternatives will result from the influence in which Democratic defeat or success in the present campaign will have upon the presidential struggle next year.” The article attempted to rally the Democrats by suggesting that there will be “alternatives” if constituents do not vote. Despite this call to action on the part of the Democrats, in the 1872 presidential election, the hopes of the to eliminate the Republicans from the executive are crushed because incumbent President Grant defeated their candidate Horace Greely."," "," "],"display_date":"October 7, 1871","search_date":"1871-10-07","locations":[{"id":10918,"lat":40.9190359343,"lng":-77.8196278227,"zoom":9,"place":"CENTRE, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":658,"tag":"Elections"},{"id":1873,"tag":"Republicans"},{"id":1874,"tag":"Democrat"},{"id":1875,"tag":"Presidential Election"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5818,"title":"Northern Democrats Rally Around the Union Flag","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-18","end_date":"1861-04-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Upon the end of the siege on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, <em>The Democratic Watchman</em> of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania reflected a disappointment with the Lincoln Administration, but gave support for the Union war cause. The Union lost the fort for the remainder of the war during the first battle of the American Civil War, but the newspaper was more concerned with the fact that the North was going to be under control of the Republican Party because the war had officially started.","During the battle, not a single life on either side was lost to hostile fire, but in the eyes of the northern Democrats the real loss was the representation of Democrats in Congress, according to the newspaper. The political unrest, such as outlined in the Democratic-leaning <em>Watchman</em>, occurred as a result of the war starting to spread throughout the country. Citizens had many new worries including the length and cost of the war, and whether  the states would unite under again.","Despite the many different reactions to the attack on Fort Sumter, the one aspect that was commemorated was the flag. The flag of the United States, a symbol of freedom and democracy in the Union was taken down after the battle and replaced with the Confederate national flag. In the article, the tone changed when the flag was discussed. Historian Mark E. Neely commented about the flag at the fort, “the first prints of Sumter were quickly supplanted by those depicting the American flag under attack. These constituted the earliest manifestations of the Union image…” As Neely points out, the tone of the Watchman piece was hardly unique in expressing fervor for the Union despite opposing Republican leadership in general. As the <em>Watchman </em>article stated, “We can have no government on any other terms, but it has often been found in the world’s history that a bad government is better than none at all.” The statement exemplifies that the Democratic northern citizens know that they need the government to win the War Between the States and without it there would be not be a chance.","The article portrays a negative connotation towards all government bodies, but the rally-around-the-flag cry had a larger impact because the people know that they need the government to win the war."],"display_date":"April 18, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-18","locations":[{"id":10917,"lat":40.9190359343,"lng":-77.8196278227,"zoom":9,"place":"CENTRE, Pennsylvania"},{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1873,"tag":"Republicans"},{"id":1876,"tag":"Fort Sumter"},{"id":1877,"tag":"Flag"},{"id":1878,"tag":"Democrats"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6144,"title":"The Republican State Convention","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-04-01","end_date":"1892-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In April 1892 the republican state convention was held in Tallahassee, Florida. An event where Republicans can choose who to elect and who will represent them in the national republican convention.[1] The state convention was an important event in time where the Republicans attack the Democrats and elaborate on the reasons why they shouldn’t rule in Florida. The Republicans were angry that the Democrats were taking their votes over the years and feel as if the Democrats are manipulating the system. The Republican vote has dropped significantly in Florida since 1888, basically losing more then fifty percent of their votes. The Republicans go as far as calling the Democrat’s rule in Florida  “tyrannical” and dishonest. They accuse them of arson, robbery, murder, and assassination if in the interest of democracy. The state convention is also where the republicans chose their delegates to attend the national republican convention. The delegates were Joseph E. Lee, E. R. Gunby, James A. Shann, John G. Long, W. R. Long, George F. Horr, S. H. Coleman, and H. S. Chubb. H.S. Chubb being the well-known mayor of Winter Park. Half of the delegates were black and the other half white. These delegates were instructed to vote for the renomination of Benjamin Harrison.[2] In attendance was a staunch Republican who is well known for both his newspaper editing and political involvement in Florida. G.C. “Gus” Henderson was a newspaper editor in Winter Park, Florida. He established the second black newspaper in the state of Florida. He was not just a political advocate in Winter Park but also a newspaper editor around Florida. Henderson saw the Republican Party as an advocate for the black Americans. He interestingly states in one of his speeches in Hannibal Square 1888  “…all we ever received came from the Republicans. Our citizenship, our freedom, our free schools, and numerous good laws that have done great good for the Negro came from the Republican Party, and, gentleman, if that party never does any more special good for me, I shall die a Republican.” It would only make sense for G. C. Henderson to attend this pivotal state convention in Tallahassee, Florida.[3] The national republican convention was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota also 1892 a couple months later. The Republicans would meet from all over the country for secret meetings, public rallies and speeches, which resulted in the nomination of then Harrison as the party’s presidential candidate.   Harrison is then nominated as the Republican candidate for president on the first ballot on the final day of the 1892 Republican National Convention. Unfortunately, Harrison did not get reelected falling to the Democrat Grover Cleveland.[4]"],"display_date":"April 1892","search_date":"1892-04-15","locations":[{"id":1399,"lat":30.4580531641,"lng":-84.2778621385,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2326,"tag":"Politics 1892"},{"id":1873,"tag":"Republicans"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}}]}
