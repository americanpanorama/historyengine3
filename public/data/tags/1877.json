The Union lost the fort for the remainder of the war during the first battle of the American Civil War, but the newspaper was more concerned with the fact that the North was going to be under control of the Republican Party because the war had officially started.","During the battle, not a single life on either side was lost to hostile fire, but in the eyes of the northern Democrats the real loss was the representation of Democrats in Congress, according to the newspaper. The political unrest, such as outlined in the Democratic-leaning <em>Watchman</em>, occurred as a result of the war starting to spread throughout the country. Citizens had many new worries including the length and cost of the war, and whether  the states would unite under again.","Despite the many different reactions to the attack on Fort Sumter, the one aspect that was commemorated was the flag. The flag of the United States, a symbol of freedom and democracy in the Union was taken down after the battle and replaced with the Confederate national flag. In the article, the tone changed when the flag was discussed. Historian Mark E. Neely commented about the flag at the fort, “the first prints of Sumter were quickly supplanted by those depicting the American flag under attack. These constituted the earliest manifestations of the Union image…” As Neely points out, the tone of the Watchman piece was hardly unique in expressing fervor for the Union despite opposing Republican leadership in general. As the <em>Watchman </em>article stated, “We can have no government on any other terms, but it has often been found in the world’s history that a bad government is better than none at all.” The statement exemplifies that the Democratic northern citizens know that they need the government to win the War Between the States and without it there would be not be a chance.","The article portrays a negative connotation towards all government bodies, but the rally-around-the-flag cry had a larger impact because the people know that they need the government to win the war."],"display_date":"April 18, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-18","locations":[{"id":10917,"lat":40.9190359343,"lng":-77.8196278227,"zoom":9,"place":"CENTRE, Pennsylvania"},{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1873,"tag":"Republicans"},{"id":1876,"tag":"Fort Sumter"},{"id":1877,"tag":"Flag"},{"id":1878,"tag":"Democrats"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6005,"title":"Signed, Sealed, Delivered: A History of Detroit's City Seal and Flag","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"6/30/07","end_date":"6/30/07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The seal of the City of Detroit was adopted in 1827 when Johnathan Kearsley was the mayor and John Quincy Adams was president of the United States of America. Michigan was not yet a state, officially initiated in 1837.","The seal features two female figures, one representing Detroit when it burned down in 1803 and the other representing the modern day Detroit that rose from the ashes and rebuilding and growing into a very successful city. The text on the seal reads Speramus Meloria and Resurget Cinerbus, which means \"we hope for better things\" and  \"it has risen from the ashes,\" referring to the fire of 1803.","In the background are three lions, fleur de lis, red and white stripes and thirteen stars. The fleur de lis are symbolic of our French origins and the lions our British origins. The thirteen stars and red and white stripes represent the original thirteen colonies of the United States of America.","Looking at the flag from a modern-day perspective creates an eerie and almost future-predicting juxtaposition. The Latin inscription is very relevent in the lives of modern-day Detroiters who live in a city ravaged by poverty, unemployment and governmental neglect, but remain ever-hopeful through organizing to grow their own food on urban farms, mentoring programs to keep young youth from gang violence and cleaning up blighted areas themselves because the government has no funding to do so."],"display_date":"June 30, 1907","search_date":"1907-06-30","locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2133,"tag":"Detroit city hall"},{"id":2132,"tag":"emblem"},{"id":2131,"tag":"founding of Detroit"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1877,"tag":"Flag"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
