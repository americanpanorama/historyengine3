While many of these books did not stand the test of time or were kept private by future generations, some ended up in the archives of Furman University. One of these scrapbooks belonged to Mary Margaret Walker; born in Greer, South Carolina, Walker attended the College as an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and participated in many extracurricular events. Her personal collection is illustrative of how she spent her time at Greenville Woman's College.","Walker's scrapbook is filled with tickets to events, amongst them one to the Camp Kennebec Annual Charity Show of 1919. This record stands out because it is valid for an event that did not take place in the nearby area, but instead in a hotel located over one thousand miles away: in order to see the show, Walker had to travel to South Poland, Maine. The pathway between Greenville and South Poland was long, and dominant ideas about the vulnerability of women in the 1920s often prevented them from undertaking such a dangerous journey. Supervision was a pre-requisite for almost every occasion; at one time, a student was expelled for ''going out from the college in company of a young man more than once.''","Along with the ticket and program for the show (which included short plays and a dance) was a ticket stub for the train, which guaranteed first class passage to Maine. Due to persistent ideas about the safety of women, it is reasonable to believe that Walker was accompanied by other students who would attend the event with her. At the time, cars were gradually becoming part of daily life but were not yet a basic need; instead, the train and the omnibus were ''the dominant models of transportation.'' This did not mean, however, that these forms of transportation were recommendable. Regarded as ''uncomfortable, inconvenient, and expensive,'' they were an uneasy way to travel for daily commuter, and other forms of travel such as the horsecar were more popular.","Going to the Charity Show was one of the planned and more ''elaborate entertainments'': often, cultural events were held on campus and it is unclear whether or not the College was associated with the show in South Poland. This ticket, however, shows that female students – albeit still having to adhere to certain rules and expectations – very well could extend their urban pathway with the help of public transportation."],"display_date":"August 4, 1919","search_date":"1919-08-04","locations":[{"id":52845,"lat":44.0351316,"lng":-70.3694755,"zoom":13,"place":"Summit Springs Hotel, South Poland, Main"},{"id":52844,"lat":34.8569027,"lng":-82.4021014,"zoom":15,"place":"Greenville Womans College"}],"tags":[{"id":786,"tag":"Student"},{"id":1414,"tag":"Greenville Womans College"},{"id":2828,"tag":"Public Transport"},{"id":2829,"tag":"Leisure"},{"id":2830,"tag":"Scrapbook"},{"id":2831,"tag":"Student Life"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":148,"school_id":4}},{"id":6442,"title":"Nature as the Antithesis to College Life","course_id":148,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/19","end_date":"12/31/23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mary Margaret Walker, a Greenville Woman's College student in South Carolina, collected many documents during her college years and collected them in her scrapbook. Her memory book not only included ticket stubs, but also contains photographs of her and her friends engaging in activities. Walker's scrapbook, as noted by historian Judith Bainbridge, ''speaks volumes about the college life of a pretty and popular young woman in the 1920s and provides a student's-eye view'' on what it was like to study at the Greenville College.","In one of the photographs, a man and a woman (probably Walker herself) are captured sitting in a boat that is floating on the water. While it is unsure where this picture was taken, it must have been in a quieter area rich in nature, for there were no lakes near Greenville. Other photos from the scrapbook show Walker posing with friends near a car on the side of the road, so the most logical explanation would be that they drove to the lake – with or without the boat.","Going out into nature is something that proved to be popular amongst students of Greenville Woman's College: Walker's scrapbook is filled with other photos and stories of people enjoying the countryside. Such activities were, however, not only a change of pace from studying, but also ''relaxed tensions and refreshed body and spirit.'' They most likely appealed to students because it provided an escape from ''hectic city life.'' ","Nature, however, was also associated with escapism. In the 1920s, ''relations between the sexes differed depending upon the collegiate tradition and the . . . ratio of college men to others'': this meant that on campus, there were often strict rules imposed on the students. Yet when going out into nature, their interaction could go by largely unnoticed. Moreover, women ''no longer had to pretend that females were non-sexual beings.'' With the automobile bringing ''access and privacy,'' the rural environment became the scene of ''heterosexual play,'' where male and female students enjoyed each other's company.","College students not only sought refuge from their responsibilities in nature, but also enjoyed other activities. Walker's scrapbook is filled with invitations to a moonlight dance, the Roll-a-Way skating rink, and a concert. The college itself provided many of these activities to the students. The campus included, for example, a Fine Arts Center and a swimming pool. Receptions were also ''wildly popular,'' for they consisted of ''promenading through the parlors and eating cake and ice cream under the eyes of [male] chaperones,'' who came from Furman.","Gradually, the students of both Furman University and Greenville Woman's College began to mingle. While piety and purity were still expected from women, social events and trips off-campus provided the students to socialize with the men from Furman. It would take until 1962, however, for both student bodies to be integrated on one campus."],"display_date":"1919 - 1923","search_date":"1921-07-01","locations":[{"id":52844,"lat":34.8565054,"lng":-82.4017176,"zoom":15,"place":"Greenville Womans College"}],"tags":[{"id":2831,"tag":"Student Life"},{"id":2830,"tag":"Scrapbook"},{"id":1412,"tag":"Greenville, SC"},{"id":1414,"tag":"Greenville Womans College"},{"id":786,"tag":"Student"},{"id":739,"tag":"Nature"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":148,"school_id":4}},{"id":6447,"title":"Scrapbook of Zillie Workman Culbertson (1908) and the Increased Visibility of American Women in the Early 1900s","course_id":148,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/04","end_date":"12/31/08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A scrapbook from Zillie Workman Culbertson of 1908 showed the changing role of the students at the Greenville Female College between 1904 until 1908. In her scrapbook, Culbertson collected articles on the commencement ceremonies of each year, photographs of her “places of interest”and newspaper articles. Her collection of photographs of “Places of Interest” were not limited to places on campus, but rather locations of important buildings all over Greenville, including North Main Street and the Furman (male) college. Culbertson’s photos and collection of activities suggest an increase in the female students’ independence and mobility through the city, compared to the lives of a Greenville Female College student from the 1890s.","At the same time, although their mobility increased, it was nonetheless limited to Greenville and its surroundings, as few southerners in this era yet owned automobiles. Furthermore, although Greenville Female College’s new president was less strict on rules of interactions between young gentlemen and young ladies, a catalogue from 1907 still emphasized how important boarding was, as “students would be ‘free from exposure in bad weather, from tempting diversions of society, and from the entertaining of company.\"","Nevertheless, Culbertson’s diploma in Senior Pedagogy and her recommendation letters showed that she had not only been able to graduate the College, but was also able to find a good job in teaching after university. This is reflected in the school’s curriculum, as “The L.I. degree offered a permanent South Carolina teaching certificate upon completion and was state-initiated due to the increasing need for teachers.\" Culbertson’s experience corresponded with the changing role of women in the city. If one takes Greenville as an example, the massive boom of the town with its implementation of the railroads and the textile mills created job opportunities for women, which allowed them to move out of the domestic sphere into independent wage-earning jobs. Mass migration or white flight from the rural county to Southern cities meant a break with traditional rural values and correspondingly a re-assessment of conservative gender-roles. Thus, in this progressive, changing society the focus of the Greenville Female College was no longer on creating women that were attractive for marriage, but focused more and more on educating women in gaining their own employment. "],"display_date":"1904 - 1908","search_date":"1906-07-02","locations":[{"id":52848,"lat":34.855882,"lng":-82.400352,"zoom":16,"place":"300 college st. greenville"}],"tags":[{"id":2835,"tag":"Mobility"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":849,"tag":"Progressive Era"},{"id":2830,"tag":"Scrapbook"},{"id":1413,"tag":"Greenville Female College"},{"id":1467,"tag":"Greenville"},{"id":786,"tag":"Student"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":148,"school_id":4}}]}
