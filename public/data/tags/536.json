In May 1849, in his small New York cottage, he wrote what was to be his last completed poem, “Annabel Lee,” in which he returned to the themes that had haunted him for much of his life. The poem, set long ago in a kingdom by the sea, describes the speaker’s undying love for the beautiful Annabel Lee. Despite their youth, they share a “love that was more than love,” a love so powerful that envious angels send an unnamed illness to shatter their happiness. Though she dies, his love for her endures, and even years after her death “the moon never beams without bringing me dreams / Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.” He is drawn each night to her \"sepulchre...by the sea,\" where he lies down to sleep beside her lifeless body. Having lived only for her, his life without her is bereft of purpose. Now, he yearns only for death, to return forever to the happiness they shared so briefly in this world.","The rhythm of repeated words and phrases creates a haunting, mournful melody that mirrors the speaker’s mood. Even the poem’s meter, scholars argue, was structured to echo the very ebb and flow of the sea to which the speaker is drawn. Again and again, in “Annabel Lee,” “The Raven,” “Lenore,” and “To Helen,” Poe returned to what he called “the most poetic topic in the world—” the death of a beautiful woman. Indeed, love and death drove much of Poe’s writing, reflecting a life defined by tragedy. Abandoned by his father, orphaned as an infant, he found happiness in his marriage to his young cousin Virginia—only to watch her slowly waste away from tuberculosis. “Annabel Lee,” written two years after her death, was Poe's attempt to give words to the love and sorrow that still consumed him.","This obsession with death typified Victorian culture, which responded to the disease-defined realities of the nineteenth century by blending Christian and classical understandings of death. They infused death with beauty and redemptive power, transforming it into a work of art capable of giving meaning to one’s entire life. A “good death” was one in which the individual embraced their own mortality with hope and acceptance. Death was spiritualized as focus shifted from the dying, decaying body toward the soul. Their vision of heaven was of a physical, material place, a place of natural and artistic beauty where they would be reunited with those they love. Heaven was, as Mark Schantz argues, “a tabula rosa upon which Americans could inscribe their most profound hopes and aspirations.”","Americans blurred the boundary between heaven and earth, as if a breath of poetry—as if the power and passion of one’s love—was enough to reach those they had lost. In “Annabel Lee,” Poe describes such a love—a love that literally triumphs over the forces of heaven and earth, a love that haunts the living and that transcends death itself. It is the anguished cry of a man giving voice not only to his own pain but to the entire cultural climate of his age."],"display_date":"May 1849","search_date":"1849-05-16","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":724,"tag":"Cult of Death"},{"id":1312,"tag":"Disease"},{"id":536,"tag":"Poetry"},{"id":1317,"tag":"Edgar Allan Poe"},{"id":1318,"tag":"Annabel Lee"},{"id":1319,"tag":"tuberculosis"},{"id":1320,"tag":"love"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":6108,"title":"Colonel Edmund Lilly Transcribes Some Poems","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"4/9/42","end_date":"7/5/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Colonel Edmund Lilly Jr. sat in camp Tarlac in the northern Philippines. He, along with his unit, had surrendered to the Japanese in April and had been subjected to the Bataan death march which saw many prisoners expire from horrid conditions. Edmund then decided that the best way to live out his captivity was to keep a diary to both record his experiences and give him something to occupy his time. Edmund also had a friend, a Brigadier General and poet by the name of William Brougher, who would recite a number of poems to Edmund; Edmund would then record these poems in a notebook that he had smuggled into the camp. These poems ranged from descriptions of hardships of their captivity to memories women they knew from back home. The poems played a crucial role in maintaining the morale of the captives.","Brougher’s first poem is titled “First Fruits of the Spirit” and seems to describe how humans are able to cope with extreme hardships. The poem opens with the first stanza describing hardships:","Some burdens are more than human flesh can bear;","Some tasks are more than human hands can do","Some dangers more than human hearts can dare","The first stanza metaphorically details the rough conditions endured by the men during their captivity. The hardships hinted at in the poem show the tremendous strain placed upon the will of the men. The contents then shift to a topic that is slightly more upbeat as it describes the men’s ability to cope with these difficulties:","When weary bodies crumple on the road,","Spirit lifts us up and bids us stand;","When hearts recoil with fear before the foe,","Spirit draws the sword and takes command","This stanza shows the human spirit’s tenacious ability to cope with hardships, such as the poor conditions in the camp and the cruelty of the prisoners’ captors. The work also seems to reference the bond of comradeship developed by the soldiers as the verses seem to be a reference for the men helping each other during the troubling times. Overall, the work may be symbolic of Edmund and William’s will to survive their ordeal.","Historian Charles B. Rolland argues that the seemingly mundane act of writing poetry was extremely useful in helping the prisoners of war survive. The poems themselves were utilized to help the men vent their emotions and served as a mechanism for coping with both the rough conditions in the camps and the brutal working conditions imposed upon the prisoners. Furthermore, Roland states that poems were useful for dealing with boredom as the Japanese captors often banned any activity designed for entertainment; consequently, Edmund went through much trouble to secretly keep his journal and would have likely suffered a beating if he had been discovered with this illicit possession. The banning of activities often had an adverse effect on the prisoners’ morale as the only thing they were able to look forward to was work. Thus the writing of poetry gave the men something to pass their time with. In conclusion, poetry was a useful way for prisoners of war to both pass time and boost morale."," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"April 9, 1942 - July 5, 1945","search_date":"1943-11-21","locations":[{"id":52663,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1402,"tag":"Prisoners of war"},{"id":536,"tag":"Poetry"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6693,"title":"A Poet Turned Nurse","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","A Poet Turned Nurse"," "," "," ","Born in New York on May 31<sup>st</sup>, 1819, Walt Whitman was the second of nine children. His family was poor and he had no real schooling. He loved to read and write and studied many classics on his own. At age 12, he began a trade in printing and started writing poems. He held many jobs over the years and one was editor for a newspaper down in New Orleans called The New Orleans Crescent. While living in New Orleans during this time, he got a firsthand look at what the slave trade looked like and he was sickened by the sight. This inspired him to write, “I Sing The Body Electric”"," ","In 1861 when the Civil War began, Whitman was a freelance writer that would interview wounded soldiers in hospitals in New York. A year later, Wal Whitman’s brother was injured in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Soon Walt came down to help his brother and take care of him. When he got to Fredericksburg, he was so awestruck that he felt the need to volunteer as a nurse and care for the soldiers. He would help take soldiers to Washington D.C. so could receive better treatment. He only planned on staying a few days but ended up volunteering for the next 11 years. "," ","During this time in the Civil War, nurses received no proper training. This was a trial and error effort on the nurse’s part. They simply learned but doing. “Those who called themselves nurses learned by doing and, for the most part, gave medicines, fed patients and kept the hospitals clean.” Also during this time during the Civil War, there were fewer female nurses then there were male nurses. More times than not, male nurses were just recovering soldiers. Soon, the number of female nurses increased due to the fact that many of the soldiers turned nurses would die or become sick again. This called for an increase in the female nurse population. "," ","Unable to find a decent paying job in Washington D.C. because of his book, <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Walt was forced to take a job as a cashier. On his days off and free time, Walt spent every second he could at the hospitals tending to soldiers. His favorite hospital to visit was Armory Square Hospital. He saw the doctors and nurses as some of the best for their work but sadly many nurses did not like him for the time he spent with the patients. "," ","The war is over but Walt stays in Washington D.C. He worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Attorney General’s office. Many years later, Whitman suffered a massive stroked that compelled him to move to his brother’s home. Although Walt Whitman never regained full strength again after the stroke, he continued to write up until the day he died.
