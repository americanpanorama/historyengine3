Bath Glasson (1898) continuing through Doctors Eugene Grove (1943-1953) and Brian Winter (1979-1983) and into the arrival of the present conductor Doctor William Nichols, to name a few.  The Alma College Choir still tours annually and alternates between a national and an international tour every other year.  Originally touring during Christmas time around the Northwest United States, the choir would perform mostly for churches and stay with the church families.","The Alma College choirs have been responsible for bringing much joy to the college and communities around the world due to both the talented leadership and vocalists’ dynamic effort during daily practices, concerts, recordings and tours.  Janet Zeilinger Wolf, class of 1956, describes her four-year choral experience as a “grand time” and holds close to her heart the choir’s “family feel;” she remembers specifically the a cappella choir’s tour to Niagara Falls, New York.  From touring around Canada to singing while serving dinner in Tyler VanDusen, former students, including Nancy Dederer of 1985, have long enjoyed the unique atmosphere the choirs project and the lasting fond memories.  Music major Alan Watterworth, President of the a cappella choir in 1957, experienced one of the choirs’ overseas trips to Europe and expressed the “sense of belonging” the program offered.","With a variety of choral groups, Alma College has been able to offer students an enjoyable elective where they can exhibit their talents and spread the “soul” of Alma College across the state of Michigan, throughout the nation and around the world.  The current program consists of three groups, each with their own inimitable characteristics that make it unique in the Alma College community; the Women’s Glee Club hosts younger women as there is a great deal of interest and here they can work on sight-reading.  The Chorale has become a group of higher developed women vocalists and the entry level for young men, while the Alma College Choir is the most elite and respected choir of the three.","There is no question that the choral program has grown and developed exponentially within the last century as close to fifteen percent of Alma College’s population are members of one of the choirs where the vocalists seek to cultivate a adoration for the choral program, discover skills that will promote additional interest and to coach those who wish to further their education in the field of music."],"display_date":1887,"search_date":"1887-07-02","locations":[{"id":6340,"lat":43.2926870754,"lng":-84.6047678086,"zoom":9,"place":"GRATIOT, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":968,"tag":"Liberal Arts"},{"id":967,"tag":"Choir Tour"},{"id":966,"tag":"Choir"},{"id":946,"tag":"Alma College"}],"course":{"name":"Histories of Alma College","school":"Alma College","course_id":68,"school_id":45}},{"id":6592,"title":"Communism in Education","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"12/31/51","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Paul Wagner “preached on a theme that audio-visual education is the only remedy for the woefully inadequate teaching methods in public schools all over the country.” Wagner’s ideas of implementing audio-visual technology into Rollins College resulted in society accusing him of being Communist. But why? The emergence of McCarthyism became a nation-wide sensation that placed fear into society. McCarthyism exaggerated and exploited the Communist threat, creating an atmosphere of false accusation in which people believed they were bettering society.  “And their voices were all the more credible because of their anti-Communism, which was born not out of fear or anxiety, but rather the conviction about the wrongness of Communism.” Jennifer Delton argues that the goal of anti-Communism was to thwart liberals, not to get rid of Communists. She continues to state that Communism attacked and took over the leftist and liberal organizations due to the fundamental contradiction in the Communists’ relationship to mass movements.","Communist influence was to be kept out of all aspects of society, including education. American people became increasingly worried that Communist influences would infiltrate the schools and pervert the minds of children.  The U.S. Commissioner of Education, Earl McGrath, played a role in spreading anti-Communism throughout education. McGrath summarized the thoughts of many Americans when he stated, “Two conflicting philosophies of government and of life are now competing for the allegiance of the peoples of the world. One of these is totalitarianism… in Communist states of Russia and her satellites. The other is democracy.” When Wagner pitched his idea of audio-visual education, he believed it needed to be implemented after how successful it had been in Germany under Hitler, in which he made Belgium a Fascist state in two years.","Soviet Foreign Minister Andri Vishinski sought to conquer the world not with an atom bomb, but by spreading  “... our ideas, our brains, and our doctrines.” Due to this, civil liberties were impaired in America all in the name of national security. The academic freedoms of educators were limited, as seen with Wagner. James Rodgers and Wesley Null argue that the longer America faced the Communism problem, the broader the definition of “Communist” became. McGrath understood that the Cold War was different, as it was more intellectual than physical. Public schools existed under McGrath to win the Cold War. In order to help win this battle, McGrath implemented “Americanization” programs that teached new immigrants the American way of life. Teachers were screened to make sure that they were not too liberal, and were forced to sign loyalty pledges. Some teachers were fired and even blacklisted from employment in America.","A study was conducted on the tolerance of Communism amongst college students based on social background, secular values and religion at the University of California-Berkeley campus. According to Armand Mauss, the right-wing groups are anti-Communist and hold traditional values. The primary source of this anti-Communist group was religious and militant beliefs. Left-wing groups hold more liberal ideology and do not condone limiting civil liberties.","Paul Wagner’s idea of audio-visual technology was shut down due to Cold War politics. These politics allowed for society to accuse Wagner of being a Communist because of his liberal education idea. Little did society know that Wagner’s idea was ahead of it’s time, and audio-visual technologies would play a huge role in the future of education."," "],"display_date":"1947 - 1951","search_date":"1949-07-01","locations":[{"id":52921,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2247,"tag":"communism"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":968,"tag":"Liberal Arts"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}}]}
