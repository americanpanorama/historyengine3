During her acceptance speech, Mo’Nique gave recognition to a woman who had won the same award seventy years earlier. She expressed her deepest admiration for this woman in these words: “I want to thank Miss Hattie McDaniel for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to.”","Seventy years earlier, at the 12<sup>th</sup> Academy Awards ceremony held in 1940, Hattie McDaniel won the award for best performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of “Mammy” in David O. Selznick’s production of <em>Gone with the Wind</em>. A win for any woman at these awards would not have been as notable as it was for Hattie McDaniel and the entire community of African Americans. McDaniel’s award marked the first win for African Americans in the history of motion pictures.","Although McDaniel’s role and film presence were vital in the story of the film, her presence was not always welcomed. When the film premiered in Atlanta, McDaniel was not permitted to attend the premiere alongside her white co-stars. Strict segregation laws in Georgia required that Hattie McDaniel enter through the back door and sit in the area reserved for blacks. Furthermore, the laws did not permit her to stay at the hotel where most of the cast was staying for the premiere. Rather than incite a disturbance, Hattie McDaniel chose not to attend.","Although she played her role of “Mammy” outstandingly, black activist groups vilified her and boycotted the film. They attacked her and her fellow black cast mates for accepting their roles in the film and charged that the portrayals of blacks in the film did little to assuage the white perception of blacks as loyal servants to whites. In the essay about the historical accuracy of the film <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> author Catherine Clinton, acknowledges that <em>Gone with the Wind</em> did not take into consideration the concerns about the treatment of blacks in the United States and adds that the portrayals of black characters in the film, “[rang] true to Hollywood’s typical betrayal of African Americans.”","As much as <em>Gone with the Wind</em> trivializes the work of blacks in film, it did make certain breakthroughs for non-white actors. Clinton explains that it was the first film to portray black actors in a “plantation style” setting where they did not spontaneously burst into song. It was also the first feature film to portray black characters as themselves instead of white actors in blackface. After her win, the minds of many of those who boycotted the film changed their minds and accepted that Hattie McDaniel’s choice to portray a mammy in a post-civil war period drama did indeed change the perception of blacks in film. In her acceptance speech, McDaniel thanked the Academy for their recognition of her craft. She further expresses her thanks and hopes for the future: “I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything I may be able to do in the future. I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry.”","Seventy years later, blacks are seen in roles that may not have been possible without Hattie McDaniel, but it is still considered a breakthrough in modern media for African Americans to be included.  It is now a matter of what roles they should choose to portray.  Hattie McDaniel made it possible for African Americans to take on roles in Hollywood, but most importantly, she gave them the ability to choose their roles."],"display_date":"February 29, 1940","search_date":"1940-02-29","locations":[{"id":27733,"lat":33.0342766311,"lng":-118.614221051,"zoom":8,"place":"Los Angeles, California"}],"tags":[{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":1040,"tag":"Academy Awards"},{"id":1041,"tag":"Film"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":6776,"title":"Americans Shocked by Television Movie The Day After.","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"11/20/83","end_date":"11/20/83","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Day After,</em> a made-for-television movie directed by Nicholas Meyer and written by Edward Hume, aired November 20, 1983, on the ABC Television Network. The film dramatized the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The movie took place in Kansas City, Missouri and included cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. <em>The Day After</em> explored the effects of nuclear war from the perspective of ordinary Americans. The story focuses on several sets of characters: most notably Russell Oakes (played by Jason Robards), a doctor and professor at the University of Kansas, the Dahlbergs, a farming family from Harrisonville, Missouri and Billy McCoy (played by William Allen Young), an Air Force reservist stationed at Whiteman Air Base. The film became infamous at the time for scenes of violence and the graphic portrayal of characters perishing from radiation sickness. The movie ends with the ominous warning that “the catastrophic events you have just witnessed, are in all likelihood less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States…” <em>The Day After</em> attracted 100 million viewers, and remains the highest rated television movie in U.S. history.","The controversy surrounding the movie’s release caused an uproar among the American population. Americans criticized U.S. nuclear policy because of what they had seen in the film. ABC and the White House received hundreds of calls from anxious viewers, many of whom supported the movie’s message. Anti-nuclear activists rallied behind movements such as “Let Lawrence Live” and 800-NUCLEAR. Those in favor of nuclear deterrence, however, worried that the emotional fall-out of the movie and controversy surrounding it would negate any critical analysis of nuclear weapons. Director Nicholas Meyer stood firmly on the side of the anti-nuclear activists, denouncing ABC’s attempts to tone down the movie’s political nature. According to historian Deron Overpeck, Meyer wanted to “clobber sixty-million people over the head” with his criticisms of nuclear weapons.","The role <em>The Day After</em> played in changing U.S. nuclear policy is debatable. When the movie premiered in 1983, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were at their worst levels in twenty years. President Ronald Reagan viewed it days before its premier on ABC. While the movie left Reagan shaken and disheartened, he continued to defend nuclear deterrence as a means to pressure the Soviet Union to the negotiating table. Despite this, <em>The Day After</em> spurred public conversation about nuclear war to reach levels unseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis twenty-one years earlier. The movie’s greatest impact was not changing the minds of policy makers, but its effect on how ordinary Americans debated nuclear policy."],"display_date":"November 20, 1983","search_date":"1983-11-20","locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.7804872,"lng":-73.9679741,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1041,"tag":"Film"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"},{"id":3507,"tag":"ABC"},{"id":3508,"tag":"Anti-Nuclear Activism"},{"id":3509,"tag":"Movie"},{"id":3510,"tag":"Nuclear War"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":178,"school_id":3}}]}
