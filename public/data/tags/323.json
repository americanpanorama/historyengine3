More often, than not, these men are not the ones who make the history books. Small unit combat is not something that we often associate with the Civil War. Often our images are of masses of men moving at each other with flags waving and horns blowing. But this was not always the case. Often it was a few men scattered around hiding behind trees taking advantage of what cover they had firing at another group of men doing the same thing. However, according to the combat principles of the time this was to be avoided as much as possible because when this happened Civil War era communication practices and technologies made it almost impossible to retain unit cohesion and command structure. It is often thought that situations like this were more favorable to Southern troops because of their largely rural upbringing as well as the fact that most white Southern men had spent at least some time on the quasi military slave patrols. This meant that these men had worked together before in combat like situations, whether it be stalking a deer, or chasing an escaped slave, and these experiences gave them a distinct advantage over their enemies.","One good example of this comes from Second Lieutenant Kelso of the 25th Tennessee at the Battle of Petersburg. During the initial Union assaults on June 16th Lieutenant Kelso noticed a gap between his unit and an artillery battery of about one hundred yards. After the first Union charge was beaten back, Kelso organized a group of 17 men and moved them into the gap taking up cover wherever they could. Another charge came bearing down on Kelso as he was moving, His men had just gotten into position when the Northerners were within fifty yards. The Tennesseans began firing rapidly at the Union men forcing them to take cover in a ravine. While under cover the Federals began waving their handkerchiefs, Kelso ordered a ceasefire and asked them to surrender, they did not so he began to fire again. However, Kelso then adavanced with is men and took them captive. As he did this a third charge came upon his men which he was once again barely able to beat back. Despite these assaults Kelso was able to retain possession of the prisoners and their colors.","This is very interesting and important low level officer work. However, it was not supposed to happen. In civil war combat these kind of small unit actions were never part of the plan. It took a lot of bravery and leadership on Kelso’s part, who was also earlier commended for bravery at Drewey’s Bluff, to accomplish this."," ","This episode can be translated into many larger themes of the Confederacy at this stage of the war. Men who earlier would not have held positions of leadership had been thrust upon the stage. It also shows that by now most men in the Army of Northern Virginia had become veteran soldiers, used to taking the initiative and thinking in terms of the broader picture. It would be hard for us to imagine a Lieutenant in either army taking this kind of responsibility on himself at First Manassas, however, by now men had become used to dealing in death and destruction"],"display_date":"June 16, 1864 - June 18, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-17","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":323,"tag":"Petersburg"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4724,"title":"The Mishaps of Being in a Halfhearted Assault","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-15","end_date":"1864-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The battle of Petersburg is remembered as one of the most destructive of the war. <br /> Petersburg can be considered the last stand of the Army of Northern Virginia. After months of maneuvering and fighting, Grant had finally forced Lee into defending Richmond itself. Before this the campaign had consisted of Lee moving to block Grant’s advances, trading ground for time. Now there was no more ground left. Lee and the Southerners would be forced to fight it out with Grant where his much more numerous and much better supplied army could only ultimately win.","The 29th Massachusetts was one of the units involved in the heavy fighting, especially early in the campaign. People often forget that the first couple of days of fighting consisted of a lot of movement and rapid advances as Beauregard scrambled to meet and check the Union advances. The 29th crossed the James late on the night of the June 15th. On the afternoon of the 17th they assaulted the Confederate works which they were able to take control of, however by 10 p.m. they were forced to retreat because of lack of ammunition. They were then put in the trenches until the 30th of July when they were involved in another assault against the Confederate works. They were able to capture a fort however they were forced to retreat this time as well. During this fighting their brigade suffered very heavy casualties. Just a week before the last attack their colonel was relieved of his duties. Then during the attack their commanding general was taken captive, this meant that in one week the command had been moved to 3rd in charge. Meanwhile another Massachusetts unit in their brigade, the 57th, was being commanded by a lieutenant and an enlisted man. In fact in his report, Lt. Colonel Barnes apoligizes for its tardiness due to the many different changes in brigade and regimental command. This helps to show some of the confusion that can occur when just a few people are wounded, go missing, or are killed. The death of one low ranking general could leave thousands of men ineffective and leaderless."," ","This pattern shows a lot about the battle of Petersburg. Initial Union assaults had the possibility of carrying the day, but the Union high command was loath to commit the numbers or power needed to complete victory. There have been several theories put forth for this lack of elan. One is that the Army of Northern Virginia and Robert E. Lee had achieved a near mythic status in the mind's of the Army of the Potomac. Some Union soldiers thought that no matter what they did, no matter how many they outnumbered them by the men in grey would find a way to win. While this may have been true earlier in the war I think that this had been dispeled by then. The Union armies had taken all that the Confederates could throw at them at Gettysburg and had held fast. However, the other theory holds more traction. This was the belief in the \"Cold Harbor\" syndrome. At Cold Harbor the North launched several massive assaults on prepared positions and had suffered horrendous casualties as a result. This it is thought made the Northern commanders scared to commit all of their reserves in an assault even if it had promise of succeeding, as did those of the early phases of the battle or even on the assault of the 29th."],"display_date":"June 15, 1864 - July 30, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-07","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":323,"tag":"Petersburg"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}}]}
