Lurleen Wallace had been elected governor of the state a year before, and could not make it to the event. “As you know, she is quite sick,” the former governor told the crowd according to the <em>Birmingham Herold Post</em>. Lurleen had been diagnosed with cancer and she was in Montgomery recovering from a recent surgery. The AEA’s president, Vernon St. John decided to send a telegram to the beloved governor and tell her that “the teachers were inspired by her courage, [...] spirit, and uncomparable devotion to Alabama and her people”","In 1966, the state became aware that their new governor was being hospitalized for a hysterectomy. The administration did not tell the press about Lurleen’s condition, but rumors circulated that she had cancer. George Wallace instructed his staff and the doctors not to tell his wife about an abnormality in her biopsy they had found back in 1961. “His decision was not unusual for its time”, writes historian Dan T. Carter. When Lurleen found out from a mutual friend that she had been misled, she was furious. George had a number of reasons not to tell her; he simply did not want rumors spreading that the governor was dying.","George and Lurleen’s oldest son, George Jr. wrote a book about his famous parents in which he recounts the time when Lurleen followed George as governor. “My mother was not the kind of woman you would have expected to be a Governor,” he writes. It was widely known that Lurleen ran for the office simply because her husband, George, desired a third term in office and he was also planning on running for the presidency. He suggested that she run for the governorship, and she became determined to win the election. The crowd that gathered to listen to her inaugural speech could tell that she was tremendously humbled by the people’s confidence in her. More than likely, she knew that without her husband’s help and his presence, she would never have taken part in public life. “I entered the race for Governor for the purpose of permitting my husband to take our fight to the final court of appeal - the people of the United States,” she told the crowd at her inauguration. Although Lurleen was the one who made the decision to run for the executive office in her husband’s place, George’s decisions and policies ultimately shaped her administration.","The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s compelled the nation to reflect on social issues beyond those of segregation and racism. Women realized they still suffered discrimination and injustice in employment, social security, legal treatment of women, and education. Women made up 40 percent of the work force by the end of the 1960s, and more than half of those women were married. They soon began organizing to acquire equal pay and to end job discrimination. Although young women were joining the fight against these social issues across the South, Lurleen Wallace and her politics did not reflect these changing times. She was neither a part of the work force, or an activist for social justice. Governor Wallace’s short administration was overshadowed by not only her husband’s segregationist and conservative policies, but her failure to stand up for change during a time of social transformation."],"display_date":"March 15, 1968","search_date":"1968-03-15","locations":[{"id":31662,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2260,"tag":"female governor"},{"id":2259,"tag":"governor"},{"id":2258,"tag":"women's movement"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":1071,"tag":"Civil Rights Movement"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1507,"tag":"1960s"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6247,"title":"Black Feminism and The Women's Liberation Movement","course_id":125,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1970s were characterized as an era of protest, activism, and change in America. Anti-war protests against the war in Vietnam and the involvement of the United States in Indochina were popular. As the women's liberation movement continued, the disparity between the needs and agendas of black feminists and white feminists became more evident. In the \"Black Women's Liberation\" pamphlet, two articles, \"Why Women's Liberation is Important to Black Women\" by Maxine Williams and \"Take a Look at Our Problems\" by Pamela Newman, identified the unique needs of black women that served to divide black feminists from the women's liberation movement. The authors identified the aspects of the women's movement that hindered the involvement and development of minority women, like racist sentiments and a narrowly-oriented set of goals that favored white, upper-and-middle class women. The narrow, class-focused orientation and goals of white feminists led many black feminists to value racial liberation over gender liberation.","A major source of tension between black feminists and white feminists was the push by upper-and-middle class white feminists and Southern Republicans for Congress to pass the Equal Rights Act (ERA) that granted both sexes equal rights under the law. The ERA was strongly opposed by the American Federation of Labor and other labor unions because they feared that the amendment would invalidate and weaken protective labor legislation for women. Black feminists, like the labor unions, favored state protective labor laws because they protected the minority women, who disproportionately formed the bulk of the women's labor force, from horrible working conditions like extreme hours, unfair pay, and dangerous work environments. Upper-and-middle class white feminists, however, unfamiliar with labor-intensive jobs and their harsh conditions, saw these laws as restrictive for upwardly-mobile women in the workplace. Black women and black feminists experienced a far greater array of oppression than their white counterparts-- as a woman, as a worker, and as an African American. As the case on state protective laws illustrates, the oppression that black women faced also came from the women's liberation movement. Disparity between the needs of the races functioned to solidify black women's resolve and efforts to focus on racial liberation rather than the liberation of women as a gender."],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2492,"tag":"state

a warm June day in the year 1966, 28 frustrated women went to Washington D.C. to attend the third National Conference of Commissions.[1]  The topic for this conference was the status of women in the United States.  While some believed that women became equal in America the moment that they gained the vote, others, these 28 women specifically, believed that the U.S. still had a long way to go to gain equality between the sexes.  Yet upon attending the conference they felt that not enough of the issues were being dealt with or even discussed.  Issues like that of equal opportunities for employment for both sexes.[2]  These 28 intelligent and educated women experienced first-hand the discrimination and limitations that came with being a woman in the job market during that time.[3]  Even though, governmental departments such as the Women’s Bureau may have been putting out reports of female contentment in the private sphere, or the home, these women said different.[4]  Soon after the conference these 28 women founded the National Organization for Women, an American Feminist Advocacy group.","These 28 women after leaving the conference threw their anger at the lack of progress for women into creating an activist feminist organization whose goal was to attempt to tip the scales in the favor of women everywhere in America.[5]  They wanted to challenge a system that would have much preferred women remain in their supposedly traditional roles in the home.[6]  Also to give a voice to the issues that women cared about and effected them directly, on a political and national scale.  With the help of Betty Friedman, the author of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, these women formed a feminist civil rights group.  Friedman also came up with the idea to name the group “NOW” or the National Organization for Women.[7]  Books like Friedman’s <em>Feminine Mystique </em>helped to create a consciousness in the United States which led to more discontentment with the status of women in the country.[8]  This consciousness along with many other factors contributed to the women’s movement in that time and eventually the creation of the National Organization for Women.","Later as NOW grew to include chapters all across the United States they felt the need to share their origin story.  So pamphlets were distributed, recounting the narrative of the founding of the organization to the newly formed chapters all over the country.  This most likely give the new chapters a sense of connection to the group on its national level.  Rather than just each individual chapter creating its own ideology and goals, NOW wanted all the chapters to understand the importance of the ideas that the organization was founded upon and the goal of helping women to gain their political voice."," ","[1]NOW Origins Pamphlet, in MSS 310 National Organization for Women National records,","Administrative 1966-1993, Special Collections, Augustana College, Rock Island IL.","[2]

June 30, 1982, the extension for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) expired. In Lafayette Park, Washington, D.C., the members of the National Organization of Women (NOW), led by Eleanor Smeal, were in mourning. Just two miles away, at the Shoreham Hotel, the victors held their celebration. A ballroom filled with balloons and thousands of attendants sang patriotic songs in triumph. Phyllis Schlafly, the leader of the “STOP ERA” movement, hosted the “Over the Rainbow” Celebration, in which well over a thousand  men and women from around the country commemorated their victory over the ERA. The banquet hall at the hotel was set for a reception of almost 1,500 attendants.  The attendants exuded both patriotism for their country and strong Christian convictions. Schlafly delivered her speech, saying, “it is a great victory for women, for men, for families, for the combat-effectiveness of our armed forces, and for our nation that ERA will not go into the U.S. Constitution.” She and other speakers proceeded to discuss the future of their movement, which included promoting military spending to increase U.S. security, campaigning against a nuclear freeze, opposing the teaching of sex education, and ridding schools of all feminist influences from school texts. The celebration concluded with the singing of “God Bless America.”","Phyllis Schlafly and her fellow conservative opponents to the Equal Rights Amendment had been actively pursuing the death of the ERA since 1972, when the bill passed in Congress. Schlafly and other female opponents argued against the amendment, saying that the ERA was a fraud and actually took away their rights.  Schlafly asserted that the passage of the ERA would lead to the women losing “the most precious and important right of all” of having children and being supported while watching them grow and develop. Most importantly, she asserted that with the passage of the ERA, women would be forced into the military draft, which she believed would be disastrous. Schlafly said that the “women’s libbers” did not represent the majority of women in the U.S., and were undermining the American family by promoting “day-care centers for babies instead of homes…and abortions instead of families.” After ten years of opposing the ERA, Phyllis Schlafly and other conservative ERA opponents successfully killed the amendment in 1982. ","The death of the ERA was in large part due to a significant resistance from many conservative women. These women believed their rights and femininity were being taken from them by being granted equality based on sex.  Men also played a part in the battle for the ERA, both for and against, although the majority of the male population had a much more ambiguous stance on the issue than women, who had more clear views on their positon. In Kansas, one of the fifteen states who rejected the ratification of the amendment, thousands of citizens wrote to their representatives in opposition to the ERA.  According to Kristi Lowenthal, of the over 2,000 authors of these letters, ninety percent were women, illustrating the widespread opposition by women to the women’s rights movement and the ERA.  The death of the ERA illustrated a strong American resistance to change, even by the women it was aiming to free from oppression."],"display_date":"June 30, 1982","search_date":"1982-06-30","locations":[{"id":52868,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Wahington, D.C., USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2258,"tag":"women's movement"},{"id":2864,"tag":"Equal Rights Amendment"},{"id":2863,"tag":"Conservative Movement"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}}]}
