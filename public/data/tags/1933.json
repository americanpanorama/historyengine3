Young International Airport).  Later, in the 1990s, the city decided that there should be a buffer between the airport’s runways and the neighborhood that now existed right next to the airport.  The disappearing houses are largely thanks to a 1994 plan by the Detroit City Council to buy out around five hundred neighborhood residents in order to create this buffer, called the French Road Mini-Take.  Assured that the project would only take 18 months and they would not be left in a no-man’s land, the residents agreed to it.  Twenty years later, however, the project has still not been completed.  Several mayors have since promised to finish it, but the lack of funds available to the city have resulted in 100-150 occupied homes still remaining in a sort of limbo amid the empty lots— there are homes, but the neighborhood has been stripped away."],"display_date":"1981 - 1997","search_date":"1989-07-02","locations":[{"id":37726,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2018,"tag":"aerial photograph"},{"id":2017,"tag":"French Road"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1933,"tag":"Detroit City Airport"},{"id":1935,"tag":"Nortown, Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
