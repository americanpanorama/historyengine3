A magnificent site where the unbroken forests were filled with lilies, mossy roots, and rivers running through the mountains. However, looking towards the west, smoke clouds filled the skies, and gold mines scarred the once-untouched forest landscape. When gold was found in California in 1848, miners flooded into the valley and seized resources from the Modoc Indians, taking possession of the land in search of wealth. Now, more than forty years later, the land was perforated with gaping holes and shafts. The \"gentle savages\" who Miller had known for years had inhabited the land with far more kindness. They did not smite the rocks for gold or cut down tress, nor did they roil the water and ruin it for fishermen. The tribes had at first welcomed the gold rushers, only to be forced out. American settlers used the land for the pursuit of wealth and impoverished the ecosystem for both the native people and for their fellow settlers, the farmers. Miller lamented the Indians' suffering, and regretted that they had no advocate to help preserve the lands that had been given to them by the \"Great Spirit.\"","The California gold rush of the mid-nineteenth century brought tens of thousands of settlers into the valley within just a few years, making the San Francisco area an international port. The companies and miners who flooded the area molded the law to fit their own interests. The sudden influx of population and business did not allow for a stable political framework to be established, leading to a free-for-all. When the settlers rushed in the Indians were forced out of their land to make way for those that wanted  riches of gold and silver. Companies used far more water than was necessary, and hydraulic mines destroyed mountainsides, simultaneously displacing Indian tribes that had used the land and threatening American farmers. All of this needless destruction to nature and livelihood, was based on nothing more than the pursuit for fleeting material wealth."],"display_date":"August 7, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-07","locations":[{"id":52906,"lat":41.3098746,"lng":-122.3105666,"zoom":7,"place":"Mount Shasta, California"}],"tags":[{"id":2963,"tag":"Modocs"},{"id":2918,"tag":"West"},{"id":2917,"tag":"Frontier"},{"id":2916,"tag":"Gold"}],"course":{"name":"HIST 3550, American Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":155,"school_id":73}},{"id":6797,"title":"Women's Role in the Court System in Early Marietta","course_id":182,"status":"P","start_date":"1790-01-01","end_date":"1795-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women on the frontier may not have had the right to vote, but they did have the right to charge their abusive husbands with assault and defend themselves in court. Once Marietta was established as a permanent settlement in the Northwest Territory in 1787, the legal and court system was created to keep order along the frontier of the United States. Although many laws focused on men and land ownership, women also had a role to play. There is relatively no mention of women’s roles in legal documents, but there is enough evidence to suggest that women gained a voice within this newly established legal system. Abigail Kilfoil and Eliza Brasher, for example, demonstrate both the positive and negative situations that women could experience within the court system.","            Abigail Kilfoil, a local woman of Marietta, was indicted in the Court of Common Pleas, for the use of “force and arms, assaulted the body of William Linet.” She was accused of being an “evil example in like kind,” and “offending the peace of the United States of America.” This language was in her indictment, signed by the court foreman, in June of 1791. This is the only existing record of her account. Nevertheless, this document reveals a great deal about the role of women within the legal system. Although Abigail was charged for a violent act, the fact that she had a right to jury trial was significant because it illustrated that women had similar rights to men in the court of law. According to Article 2 of the Northwest Ordinance, the rights of “inhabitants of the said territory shall always be entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus, and of the trial by jury.” While inhabitants, during the 1790s, could have meant only men, it can be seen that women were entitled to these rights as well. Women had a voice in the court system, as seen through court records, even though their rights are not explicitly stated in the Northwest Ordinance.","            While the outcome of Abigail’s case did not survive, the case brought by Eliza Brasher did. Eliza Brasher filed a complaint against her husband, John Brasher, for “beating and abusing her most inhumanely,” and “attacking her with a knife drawn in his hand.” Rufus Putnam filed this indictment in July of 1792. The indictment detailed Eliza Brasher’s relationship with her husband John. Eliza was heard and acknowledged by the court through an interview and recorded statement. A warrant was issued for John Brasher. He was arrested for assaulting her both physically and verbally. Eliza Brasher demonstrates the rights of women to use the court system for their safety and advantage, despite living along the frontier in Ohio. Her testimony was central to the case against her husband, which was an uncommon trend in eighteenth century.","            Marietta was founded on an idea of fairness and freedom, which extended to all races and genders. The Northwest Ordinance made clear that the principles of life, liberty, and property were essential to the foundation of this new settlement. Marietta was progressive in providing legal rights to women, whether it be prosecutorial or defensive. Abigail was charged with assault, while Eliza was able to prosecute her abusive husband. While none of the accounts of the foundations of Marietta explicitly stated that women were able to utilize the court system, early court records from the 1790s demonstrate that this new legal system was progressive regarding the rights of women.  "," "],"display_date":"1790 - 1795","search_date":"1792-12-31","locations":[{"id":53139,"lat":39.415352,"lng":-81.4548436,"zoom":9,"place":"Marietta, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":3560,"tag":"Women, Law"},{"id":2917,"tag":"Frontier"}],"course":{"name":"Professional Historian","school":"Marietta College","course_id":182,"school_id":101}}]}
