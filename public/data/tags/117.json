Hotchkiss had just received news that one of his children had passed away. He longed to be at home with his family, but said, \"It is forbidden of me & it is now too late to reach you before the crisis has passed.\"  He continued to describe for her the most recent skirmish with the Union that happen on March twenty-third, a \"bloody battle…resulting disastrously to our arms.\" He mentioned that Jackson conducted the retreat well and the Confederacy only lost a few miles because of it. Hotchkiss commented that \"'Stonewall' Jackson was deceived as to the number of the enemy when he started,\" and that as it progressed more Union troops joined the fight.","The Fifth Company of Virginia bore the brunt of the battle and slowed the advance of the Union. At the end, the Confederates lost forty soldiers and some three-hundred wounded. Hotchkiss lamented that the Union \"refused to let us bury our dead or bring away our wounded.\" The Confederates did not have their wounded men removed from the battlefield until March twenty-fourth. After transporting their wounded soldiers from the battlefield, the companies met with Jackson who ordered them to retreat.  Hotchkiss wrote that the companies now lay ten miles away from the Union, approximately sixty miles from Staunton, Virginia. He ended his letter extending his thanks to his neighbors at home for helping his wife through the troubling times, and added that his wife address letters to him as  \"Mt. Jackson to be sent to Jedediah Hotchkiss\" because the Augusta Battalion of Virginia potentially could have departed from this area by the time the letter reached her.  ","Hotchkiss's experience was not unlike that of both Confederate and Union soldiers. Many suffered from homesickness. William Marvel wrote about this in, <em>Andersonville: The Last Depot</em>,<em> as </em>something that doctors at Andersonville Prison later termed, \"nostalgia,\" deeming it the first mental depression to be diagnosed. Soldiers' morale also suffered because of the inhumane treatment of the dead and wounded that they experienced out on the battlefields as well as in prisons and hospitals if they were unlucky enough to be there. The Shenandoah Valley was important to the Confederates as a source of provisions and as a route for invading the North. As far as the Federals were concerned, the Valley was not a suitable invasion route; however, it was important that they deny its use to the enemy.

Shenandoah</em> would continue the Confederate fight long after the Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered. Named after the valley and county in Virginia, the <em>C.S.S. Shenandoah</em> had a C.S.A letter of Marque to sail towards the Indian Ocean to seek out, capture, or destroy Union military and commercial vessels. It was hoped that the <em>C.S.S. Shenandoah</em> would have the same successes as the <em>C.S.S. Alabama</em>, as the latter privateer proved an insult to the superiority of the Union navy."," She moored in at Melbourne, Australia to repair damages sustained in her journey to the other-side of the globe. Photographs show the Confederate vessel hauled from the port receiving repairs – her three large masts standing strong and undamaged – and the 'Stars and Bars' battle flag flying  as Australian crews worked on her hull. The battle flag stands out in the photograph and it is rumored that this is a retouched image. If retouching of the photograph did take place, it demonstrates the 'lost cause' patriotism attached to the Confederate's battle ensign.","Reports from Panama for the Northern newspaper of the <em>New York Times</em> discussed rumors that the Confederate ship had been seen in, or around Melbourne, and that repairs could have taken place before the alleged sighting of the <em>C.S.S. Shenandoah </em>leaving \"that port on the 18th of February [1865].\" With the destination of the pirate vessel unknown, the paper speculates that the ship is headed to the West Coast of North America to \"track steamers from the gold regions [of the U.S. and Mexico] to Panama.\" In actuality, the vessel took approximately five months to reach the west-coast of North America. This was due to a skirmish that took the vessel as far north as the Bering Strait, which burnt, bonded, sunk twenty-plus ships aiding the commercial interests of the Union's economy.  For this voyage, as many as forty Southern sympathizes from Australia boarded as new crew on the C.S.S<em>. Shenandoah</em>."," It was not until August of 1865 that the vessel received any word of the South's armies collapsing. During its service for the Confederacy under the command of C.S. Navy First Lieutenant James Iredell Waddell, it was the only Confederate vessel to have circumnavigated the globe. Her time on the seas did not cease though after the rebellion, as the <em>C.S.S. Shenandoah </em>was sold to England. But, eventually she was lost at sea during her service to the Sultan of Zanzibar.
