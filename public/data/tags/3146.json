Right at the turn of the century, Dr. Willis D. Gatch, an Indiana University graduate of 1901 and then Resident Assistant Surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, published his work on his modern surgery bed. Later called the Gatch Bed, it solved a great deal of issues in several areas of patient care. Originally intended for the treatment of peritonitis, an inflammation in the inner abdomen wall, the Gatch Bed soon showed beneficial in several other surgeries, in postoperative care, for patients with respiratory illnesses, for large patients with recent abdomen issues, and for comfort of any patient that may need or desire to lay at any angle.","Previously, patients receiving treatment for peritonitis were propped up by positioning pillows behind the back and under the knees, an inclined plane of some sort behind the back, or even by using a regular rocking chair. These techniques proved somewhat useful, but many were too yielding for proper patient care. During treatment for peritonitis, the Fowler Position (upright back position with knees elevated) is required. If the patient slips down at all, bacteria instantaneously floods the diaphragm. With the implementation of the Gatch bed, surgeons no longer had to worry about the patient slipping down; and the room staff was no longer exhausted from constantly repositioning patients. Because of its usefulness in many situations, the Gatch bed was soon implemented widely amongst hospitals and used in all forms of patient care.","Gatch later took his career back to Indiana University and was appointed Dean of the IU School of Medicine in 1932. Gatch has been described as a rugged individualist. He was said to often treat human relationships with the hand of a surgeon. He held a tight rein as dean, as he fought the problem of adequate financial support in the years following World War II. It has been said that it is doubtful that any other dean enjoyed so much autonomy as Gatch. The School of Medicine was caught in a troublesome time, having to make enormous efforts to keep up with the rapidly advancing world of medical science, and to maintain a respectable rating among American medical schools. Gatch served as Dean until 1946. "],"display_date":"March 1, 1909 - March 31, 1909","search_date":"1909-03-16","locations":[{"id":52977,"lat":39.2978804,"lng":-76.5942318,"zoom":8,"place":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"id":52978,"lat":39.1670467,"lng":-86.5269373,"zoom":8,"place":"Indiana University"}],"tags":[{"id":3146,"tag":"Surgery"},{"id":3147,"tag":"Bed"},{"id":3148,"tag":"Indiana"},{"id":3149,"tag":"Johns Hopkins Hospital"},{"id":3150,"tag":"Indiana University"},{"id":3151,"tag":"Gatch"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6771,"title":"A Much Needed Change","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-05-01","end_date":"1847-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","One spring evening in May of 1847, Issac Hays, chairman of the newly established American Medical Association (AMA), stood from his seat surrounded by colleagues, having just finished creating the original code of ethics adopted by the AMA. The code, having since then been the standard of medical ethics in the United States, was modeled heavily on the ethical beliefs of the European physician ad author Thomas Percival, who created the first code of ethics. Up until a code was written and adopted in the U.S., there were no official national means of regulating proper ethical behavior in the healthcare field, and many states themselves lacked laws explicitly stating ethical expectations in the medical profession. Due to this, the code of ethics specifically touched on the need for doctors to recognize the entirety of the power they possessed to not take advantage of it."," ","This code of ethics was eventually commented on by Dr. Austin Flint, president of the AMA in 1883. In this commentary, Flint focused on the importance of physicians upholding their own sense of morality, a topic he felt worthy of extra attention. His commentary was divided into 3 sections: the responsibilities of physicians to their patients, and the duties patients are expected to uphold; the responsibilities physicians have to one another; and the accountability physicians are held to by the public."," ","This was a prime time for a code of ethics to be written and scrutinized, especially with the developments in surgery around that time. With the surgical field gaining popularity within the medical community, questions arose about surgeons’ morals in the operating room, when they were in control of another life. It was common for surgeons to learn to distance their emotions from their patients, which to a certain extent was to be expected—after all, they were cutting into another person before the development of anesthesia. It was expected of the doctor to remain faithful to his patient in accordance with his highest professional requirement—do no harm. There were concerns for physicians’ intentions and ethical accountability that were understandably called into question. The code of ethics was a way to unite all physicians in the states with a common goal, common standards, and a sense of accountability beyond their own conscience."],"display_date":"May 1, 1847 - May 31, 1847","search_date":"1847-05-16","locations":[{"id":11224,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3146,"tag":"Surgery"},{"id":2937,"tag":"United States"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1011,"tag":"Ethics"},{"id":3213,"tag":"History"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
