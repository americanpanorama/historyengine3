The debate over the chemical’s risks and therapeutic possibilities led to Senate subcommittee hearings on its use. Acid, as LSD is commonly called, had been sensationalized by mass media publications and, although in its early years it had been extensively and responsibly studied by medical professionals, the effects of such a powerful chemical remained unclear. Psychologist Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent advocates of LSD, arguing that his medical research of LSD had shown tremendous therapeutic possibilities. However, many Americans remained suspicious of the chemical’s powerful nature. Chairman Thomas Dodd, a conservative Democrat from Connecticut, called for quick measures to stamp out the rapid spread of LSD among America’s youth generation.","In order to gain a better understanding of LSD’s implications, Senator Dodd convened subcommittee hearings on recreational drug use among America’s youth. Leary was one of many expert witnesses called to testify. In his testimony, he asserted that “the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them,” emphasizing the need for further investigation of LSD rather than complete prohibition. Leary also claimed that LSD and many other psychedelic drugs were not dangerous if used wisely and with precautions.","However, his opinion endured aggressive questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who criticized Leary’s testimony as “general hyperbole.” Additionally, the subcommittee chairman cited an earlier testimony by another doctor who argued that LSD encouraged homicidal tendencies and destructive behavior. Leary continued his attempts to placate the committee and remove LSD’s negative associations. When Kennedy asked if LSD usage was “extremely dangerous,” Leary replied, “Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly… Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.” Leary’s testimony urged for some type of licensing that would require LSD users to be highly trained, much like a pilot’s license, so that responsible adults could use LSD “for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.” He also noted that without such licensing, Americans faced “another era of prohibition” that would create a new group of college-educated white-collar criminals. In a later autobiographical work, Leary would claim that Kennedy’s bullying presence was merely an attempt “to gain respectability points by lynching me!”","Leary was one of many experts who testified at the 1966 subcommittee hearings, which showed both ardent support and uncompromising opposition to LSD. Its testimonies marked the conflict between medical professionals, intellectuals, and government officials who struggled to agree on LSD’s meaning as well its regulation. The hearings also embodied the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, which had conservative politicians utilizing acid as a scapegoat and to suppress radicalism among America’s younger generations. Just several months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California. By October 1968, possession of LSD was banned federally in the United States with the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill, marking a tremendous step towards the “War On Drugs” campaign that would arise in the 1970s."],"display_date":"May 1966","search_date":"1966-05-16","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5258,"title":"<strong>Leary, Metzner, and Alpert Instruct LSD Initiates on How to Achieve</strong> <strong>a Successful “Psychedelic Session”</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/64","end_date":"12/31/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1964, psychologists Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert published <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, a manual intended to prepare the users of psychedelic drugs for sessions. The authors had researched the therapeutic aspects of psychedelic substances, as well as their religious possibilities. The book is heavily influenced by the <em>Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>, (also known as <em>Bardo Thodol</em>) a funerary text that describes spiritual after-death experiences. The authors’ experiments with LSD and other psychedelics began at Harvard University, until unfavorable representations in the press led to the suspension of the research and, in 1963, the dismissal of Leary and Alpert from their faculty positions at the institution. The authors continued their own research, through observation of others and under the influence of hallucinogenic substances themselves.","The text focused on the use of psychedelics with the intention of achieving spiritual enlightenment. The authors devoted Part 3 of their text to an explanation of how to achieve a beneficial experience through proper preparation for a session, noting proper drugs and dosages as well as the critical importance of an experienced “guide.” A guide was expected to serve as a relaxed, secure, and wise presence to help the “voyager” through their trip, “always ready to help navigate their course, to help them reach their destination.” Also important to a successful session was what Leary frequently referred to as “set and setting.” This idea emphasizes proper mental and physical preparation by participants, as well as a suitable environment for the experience. Most significantly, the authors stated that the manual “prepares the person for a mystical experience according to the Tibetan model,” and instructed participants to delay religious interpretations until the end of the session when they could best benefit the individual spiritually.","A significant proportion of those drawn to Buddhism and other Eastern traditions in the 1960s—like Leary, Metzner, and Alpert—were influenced by the effects of psychoactive substances, and vice versa. Reflecting on psychedelic drug use in the 1960s, scholar Richard Batchelor asserts that “it is all too easy either to dismiss claims of spiritual significance for drugs as thinly veiled justifications for hedonistic indulgence, or to invoke the tragic consequences of heedless excess as grounds for denying the validity of any drug-induced experience at all.” LSD advocates were continually forced to defend the legitimate benefits of its use.","The authors of <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, trained in medicine and psychology, were pioneers in the exploration of consciousness and spirituality through the use of psychedelics like LSD. Their research, during the short window of time when LSD was legal, gave some legitimacy to the possibilities of personal and religious development through the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Their work on the spiritual benefits of psychedelics would become even more significant in debates over the use and control of such substances in the late-1960s—debates over one’s right to control their own brain. However, it could not prevent the federal prohibition of LSD in the United States in 1968."],"display_date":1964,"search_date":"1964-07-01","locations":[{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1009,"tag":"Psychology"},{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5572,"title":"The Who and the New Generation","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"9/17/67","end_date":"9/17/67","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The appearance of The Who on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1967 marked the beginning of a changing American society. Much like the Beatles began the First British Invasion when they appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show years earlier, they epitomized a significant change in thinking. However, unlike the Beatles, who were simply not part of the status quo, The Who actively challenged the social values that Americans had held onto.","Upon their first introduction, all the members of The Who played around with one of the Smothers Brothers, teasing him and laughing at random things they whispered to each other. They told silly jokes, like when Robert Daltry told a Smothers Brother that he came from Oz – something silly, yes, but something, anything, to break the monotony of traditional guests. This was the latest extension of the bad boy image, a puffy-shirted, brightly colored Rebel Without a Cause. These men were sex symbols because they were young and hip and attractive, but more importantly they were sex symbols because of their refusal to submit to the status quo. Their disheveled hair and cocky grins only added to their allure.","The first song they performed was “My Generation,” with such controversial lyrics as “<em>People try to put us d-down/Just because we g-get around.</em>” Daltry’s stutter was not a psychosomatic condition; rather it was one more attempt to alter the current understanding of rock and roll. Something, anything, to break the monotony of America’s conservatism of the past two decades.","“<em>Things they do look awful c-cold,</em>” Daltry continued stuttering, “<em>Hope I die before I get old.</em>” Daltry then screamed, drilling the purpose of the song into everyone’s heads, “<em>This is my generation!</em>” And this truly was the youths’ generation. All the years of old men from bygone eras had to pave way to Roger Daltry’s generation, for the young men and women of the Western world were finally speaking up and letting their voices be heard. “<em>It’s my generation, baby,</em>” Daltry repeated his mantra.","“<em>I’m not tryin’ to cause a big s-sensation</em>,” Daltry’s lyrics lied, “<em>I’m just talkin’ ’bout my g-generation</em>.” The song continued, and a few minutes later, near the ending, guitarist Pete Townshend crashed his instrument into one of the speakers. Though Jimi Hendrix is more famous for doing the same thing, The Who committed this anarchic act of vandalism a full year before Young Jimmy.","Pete Townshend then smashed his guitar on the ground. As he smashed it – once, twice, three times – the speakers exploded. It was as if a bomb went off. Keith Moon, the drummer, ran wailing off the stage. Pete Townshend was patting his hair rapidly, as if putting out sparks.","The explosion – which cut up Keith Moon’s hands and left one of Pete Townshend’s ears in a permanent state of near-deafness – was the brainchild of the dangerously drug-addled jokester drummer Moon. While the group expected a small explosion – more like fireworks than a small aircraft’s bombing ordinance – Keith Moon had bribed a stagehand to place more explosives inside the speaker.","Tom Smothers, the co-host who had introduced them before the song, slowly appeared back onstage while inexplicably holding an acoustic guitar. He was just as confused as everyone else, and this only increased as Pete Townshend pulled the guitar out of Tom Smothers’ hands and smashed it on the ground until it splintered into a million tiny pieces.","The anarchy on the show helped jumpstart the rule of Roger Daltry’s generation. The world had never seen people behave like that before, never heard music played like that before. Oh the wild clothes! Oh the unkempt hair! Oh the bass solo, something never before attempted! This was the song of the new generation. This was the moment of truth for the future student protests, for the counterculture movement, for the ultimate anti-establishment symbol, the long wild hair. The Who marked the beginning of the end for the old way, the <em>Leave it to Beaver</em> way, where Father knew best and all the world’s problems could be solved in 22 minutes between commercial breaks. Roger Daltry sang “My Generation” for everyone to hear, but it would most soundly resonate with the youth movement that would change the course of American history."],"display_date":"September 17, 1967","search_date":"1967-09-17","locations":[{"id":31817,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1506,"tag":"The Who"},{"id":1507,"tag":"1960s"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5579,"title":"Contrasting Shirley Chishom with the Weather Underground","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/69","end_date":"12/31/73","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The War in Vietnam was finally over, Shirley Chisholm became the first female African-American elected to Congress, and Harvey Milk became the first openly gay man elected to public office. Then again, the Watergate scandal destroyed whatever faith was left in the federal government, the Vietnam War had taken its toll on the American people, and radical left-wing groups terrorized citizens for years.","Perhaps it was the worst of times.","The disillusionment associated with the 1970s would never truly go away. No one would forget Watergate or the Vietnam War. Instead of throwing such events of the past by the wayside, the American people decided to reinvent themselves. Gone were the days of standing on the steps of high schools to protest integration. Gone were the deathly fears of communism and all that it stood for. Gone were the glances outward to the international sphere. For the first time in decades, Americans put domestic issues at the forefront of problems to be fixed. By changing the focus away from the ever-present threat of communist takeover and toward the challenging problems at home, America moved forward so that it could now be as advanced socially as it was militarily and economically.","The Weather Underground certainly was a low point in the 1970s. This group epitomized the stereotype about the 1970s being the “Me” generation; its explosive acts of domestic terrorism, rather than underscoring the war and racial issues, caused them to be overlooked. By fighting the system, the Weather Underground made it impossible for any sort of gradual change or compromise. It was either the violent overthrow of the capitalist system or nothing at all. This could also mark the end of the previous era, where everything was zero-sum: one was either communist or western, segregationist or integrationist, bad or good. The death of the Weather Underground marks the end of this black-and-white view of the world as well as the crushing antagonism against anything even remotely related to the negative events of the past.","Shirley Chisholm marked the beginning of the end for broad, generalized racism against African-Americans. Lyndon Johnson knew that he had just lost the South when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, yet during the 1972 Democratic primaries two of the three states she won were in the Deep South: Louisiana, Mississippi, and New Jersey. Though she did not take the Democratic position that year, she proved that the age in which both African-Americans and women were blindly ignored in the political sphere was drawing to a close.","Whereas Weather Underground leader Bernadine Dohrn recorded a declaration of war only to bemoan the “frustration and impotence that comes from trying to reform this system,” Shirley Chisholm sought to advance social causes from within the government rather than outside of and against it. Until the very end, the Weather Underground movement operated in secrecy, exposing themselves only to release communiques or admit their part in bombings. Chisholm, on the other hand, embraced who she was and used her unique qualities (her African-American ethnicity as well as gender) to serve her interests. While the Weather Underground bombed the Pentagon to protest the US bombing Hanoi, Shirley Chisholm hired only women (half of whom were black) for her legislative office. This gradual loosening of old trains of thought, rather than the abrupt style that the Weather Underground preferred, made much more meaningful impacts on each of Chisholm’s causes.","The Weather Underground did not make the Vietnam War end any sooner. They themselves were only a part of the international protest against the war. Nor did they succeed in overthrowing the capitalist American government and instituting a Marxist-Leninist regime. One could argue that perhaps the 1970s were not the worst time in American history. But the Weather Underground certainly didn’t make it any better.","Shirley Chisholm, on the other hand, promoted both African-American and women’s rights. Having been discriminated against her whole life, and in fact surviving three assassination attempts during her presidential bid in 1972, she made it imperative that she visit the infamously racist George Wallace after he was shot. Her method was conciliatory, not vengeful. Much like Gerald Ford officially pardoned Nixon to end the Watergate scandal, she chose to make amends rather than keep a lifelong enemy. She was truly a pioneer for both women and African-Americans.","One could correctly argue that the Weather Underground epitomized the “Me” generation, that though it was part of the counterculture it still followed the zero-sum ideology of the past twenty years. Shirley Chisholm, by contrast, fought for incremental increases, baby steps into her movements and ideas. Yes, her efforts were revolutionary; but they were revolutionary specifically because they did not adopt revolutionary ideologies."],"display_date":"1969 - 1973","search_date":"1971-07-02","locations":[{"id":34067,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1518,"tag":"Weather Underground"},{"id":1519,"tag":"Shirley Chisholm"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":6079,"title":"<strong><em>Rolling Stone</em></strong><strong> Publishes Hunter S.

Thompson’s pseudonym, continued, “I remember saying something like ‘I feel a bit light headed; maybe you should drive…’”  Then in a flash of terror, Duke’s light-headedness turned dramatically into full blown drug induced hallucination and chaos.  Flying down the interstate through an endless desert, bombarded by a swarm of twisted psychedelic animals, Duke and his lawyer blasted out of Los Angeles on their search for the American dream.  Published in <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine in November 1971, <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> was a semi-autobiographical work by Hunter S. Thompson, and an experiment in Gonzo Journalism.","Described as an “outlaw journalist” by his managing editor at <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Paul Scanlon, Thompson was part of a generation of journalists that rebelled against the dry writing of their predecessors and embraced writers like Tom Wolfe, author of <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em>, and <em>The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby</em>, and what became “New Journalism.” <em>Rolling Stone</em>, an alternative magazine founded in 1967, sought to cover the social, cultural, and political unrest missed or ignored by the mainstream newspapers and newsweeklies.  Hunter S. Thompson and his brand of what came to be called Gonzo Journalism, fit this scene perfectly.  Scanlon described Thompson’s standard affects as “something edible, like a grapefruit, a carton of Dunhills, a large police flashlight, a bottle of Wild Turkey, and can of liquid mace.” Though Scanlon admitted that Thompson’s process included “evenings of drug fueled adventures that left more than a few staffers dazed and worn out,” his top priority was always work.  Scanlon remembered that in his early career, Thompson told him that he had “not taste for either poverty or honest labor, so writing was the only recourse left for [him].”","<em>Fear and</em> <em>Loathing</em> was one of Thompson’s first experiments with new journalism which focused on finding “a subject that [could] induce a paroxysm of words, scribble[ing] them out on paper, then mov[ing] on before the rush [wore] off and the synapses cool[ed].” Thompson used this as his guiding principal in <em>Fear and Loathing</em>. “But that was the story? Nobody had bothered to say. So we would have to drum it up on our own.  Free Enterprise.  The American Dream.  Horatio Alger gone mad on drugs in Las Vegas. Do it <em>now</em>: pure Gonzo journalism.” Under this directive, Thompson chronicled his pursuit of the American Dream on the streets of Las Vegas armed with “two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of uppers, downers, screamers, laughers… and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw either, and a two dozen amyls.”"],"display_date":"November 1971","search_date":"1971-11-15","locations":[{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":726,"tag":"Journalism"},{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1919,"tag":"1970s"},{"id":2198,"tag":"Gonzo"},{"id":2200,"tag":"Las Vegas"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}}]}
