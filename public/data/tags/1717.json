This newsletter was sent to Nazi women who were leaders. These statements are meant to encourage women working at home and let women know what is expected of them during the war. This newsletter describes Nazi women as an army at the homeland. The newsletter discusses women taking on jobs while still keeping up with household duties. This newsletter reveals women will be rewarded with vacation time because the Nazi organization realizes the strain. Women are instructed to work together whether they are part of the organization or not to keep the country running. The outcome of the current battle is in the hands of each and every one of the citizens even those at home.","Women were not excluded from the other ordinary people who became part of what is known as the evil empire. Not all women were perpetrators and not all women fell victim to Nazification and participated only because of force. This document shows it was normal for women to take part in helping out the nation. This article addresses how important it is for woman to keep the homeland running will Nazi soldiers fight. The blanket statement that women were just victims to the Nazis cannot be made because some women were actively participating and expected to participate to keep the homeland strong. The newsletter even refers to women at home as making important economic decisions."],"display_date":"September 1941","search_date":"1941-09-15","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1715,"tag":"German"},{"id":1716,"tag":"German Women"},{"id":1717,"tag":"Nazi Women"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5718,"title":"Natural Beauty in Nazi Germany","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/34","end_date":"12/31/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The National Socialist Women's Yearbook of 1934 reveals women without makeup, without jewelry, and with large hips were considered the ideal Aryan woman in Nazi Germany. The Chairwoman of the Association for German Women's Culture, Agnes Gerlach claimed the ideal woman had become the \"big Germanic type of woman\" instead of the France's \"small, romantic type.\" Nazi propaganda highlighted larger women with large, child bearing hips. Gerlach’s article stated it was un-German to use products to change hair color or to change one's looks with cosmetics. The image of the thin French woman was emotionally damaging to German women in Gerlach's opinion. Similarly, the Jewish influence was thought to include too much focus on accessorizing and overly made up women. According to Nazi propaganda, Jewish and French woman were not strong or able to bear as many children because they were petite.  The German woman was superior and did not need to use this enhancing products to be beautiful.","Nazis associated gaudiness with Jewish women and easy women because of tradition.  Dressing plainly without make up or jewelry had been popular since the earliest Europeans. There were even periods where Europeans believed wearing make-up was immoral.  Anglo-Saxons may have never worn make up; there is no evidence of them wearing make-up. Eventually cosmetics, dying hair, and wearing gaudy jewelry became associated with easy women.  Nazis often stated the Western cultures had created an ugly and unnatural beauty.  Women in Germany were beautiful naturally and did not need to look like the Western and Jewish's flawed idea of beauty.  Nazis promoted women who were larger and who could bear children easier because this is the role the woman played in the Nazi culture. Agnes article demonstrates the opinions of the Nazis.  The ideal German woman did not need to blend in with other women of the world.  They were supposed to be the superior race; therefore, their women did not need doctoring to be beautiful and perfect."],"display_date":1934,"search_date":"1934-07-02","locations":[{"id":24536,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1717,"tag":"Nazi Women"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":1731,"tag":"Women Germany"},{"id":1732,"tag":"Nazi"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5719,"title":"Appealing to Aryan Women","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"5/2/40","end_date":"5/2/40","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A painted picture from Mother’s Day issue of <em>The Frauen Warte</em>, a Nazi women’s magazine in 1940, reveals a light haired heavy set woman surrounded by her four children. This is the ideal Aryan, Nazi woman. She is not wearing jewelry and her dress is modest. She is not even wearing a wedding ring. Her four children each have light hair and blue eyes. The children each have a present for their mother in their hands. The gifts are simple: a ribbon, a toy bird on a stick, a flower, and a small toy sail boat. This picture uses an image for idolization as propaganda. The most important place for a woman to be would be at home with her children.","Women were supposed to meet this description. Women did not wear make-up because Aryan ancestors did not wear make-up. Nazis believed in natural, modest beauty this image portrays this because the woman, who is not wearing make-up, is dressed modestly. The wife has given birth to four children. The children shown have light hair and classic Aryan features due to the genes of their parents. The ideal Aryan wife would tend to the family while her husband worked to support the family or take care of the land. The “people” used in this magazine promoted a certain look and lifestyle. This is particularly interesting because it is a Mother’s Day issue. The family looks happy and the children appear to be thankful by giving her gifts. This may be a way to motivate women to have children, preferably many. Many magazines were created to promote this look and some existing magazines were told to print this propaganda. This natural look for the woman was often promoted and sometimes compared to a Jewish woman with too much make up or a misshapen face. The natural look was a way of protesting the pornographic images of dolled up women from western culture. A larger farmed woman could have children easier and this plain, natural look represented a loving mother not an \"easy woman\". This image portrays a woman who is appreciated and serving her purpose raising children in contrast to the western images of a sexy woman only used and appreciated for their beauty and sex. This ideal family Nazi family image would set a clear standard for other families in the regime."],"display_date":"May 2, 1940","search_date":"1940-05-02","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":1717,"tag":"Nazi Women"},{"id":1246,"tag":"Propaganda"},{"id":1728,"tag":"Nazi Germany"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}}]}
