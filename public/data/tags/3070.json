National Security Action Memorandum 196 established the ExComm to ensure effective decision making during the crisis. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. stated that it was during the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis when the world came closest to nuclear war. The memorandum called for Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, and Army General Maxwell Taylor, including others, to gather in the Cabinet Room of the White House. Robert Kennedy had no experience in foreign policy crisis, but was a member because the President trusted him.","Before Kennedy’s presidency, the US was an enemy of Cuba and its leader, Fidel Castro. The Eisenhower administration trained anti-Castro Cuban exiles for a CIA-backed invasion of Cuba. That invasion, known as the Bay of Pigs, failed in April of 1961 under the Kennedy Administration, which further worsened Cuban-US relations. According to Schlesinger, Kennedy lost trust in his Joint Chief of Staffs and said, “If we do what they want us to do, none of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong.” Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, persuaded Castro to accept nuclear missiles to deter US aggression, starting the Cuban Missile Crisis","Kennedy was interested in removing the missiles from Cuba without military intervention, but he struggled with the idea that such a demand might lead the US into a nuclear war. Historian David Gibson stated that the ExComm discussed a diplomatic approach, in which the US would withdraw their medium-range ballistic missiles from Italy and Turkey and/or withdraw from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for the withdrawal of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The ExComm suggested a naval blockade to prohibit more weapons from entering Cuba. Advisors recommended more aggressive solutions, such as airstrikes on missile sites in Cuba, airstrikes on a variety of military targets in Cuba, and an invasion of Cuba.","During meetings, CIA officials briefed the ExComm on new intelligence about the missiles and the locations of Soviet ships and submarines, but there were no formal agendas. Gibson stated that Kennedy was the chief decision maker and recipient of all information. Kennedy asked advisors about surveillance, logistics, and military tactics. He analyzed each advisor’s answer and then probed them with follow up questions. For example, Kennedy wanted to know how quickly ground soldiers could invade Cuba following airstrikes. McNamara and Taylor clarified that it would take seven days of airstrikes, followed by eleven days of invasion until 90,000 soldiers would be in Cuba. The ExComm had sharp disagreements and criticized each other, but as Robert Kennedy said, “everyone had an equal opportunity to express himself and to be heard directly.” However, the anger and criticism of the men stemmed from the situation where a wrong recommendation could mean the end of the human race. The Cuban Missile Crisis ended on October 28, 1962 when President Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed that the missiles would be returned to the USSR in exchange for the US to pledge they would not invade Cuba again.  ","During a joint conference on the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1992, General Anatoly Gribkov of the USSR declared that 43,000 Soviet soldiers were in Cuba during the crisis. In addition, Soviet soldiers were equipped with short-range tactical nuclear weapons and were authorized to use them if communications with Moscow were severed. However, during the crisis, the CIA estimated only 10,000 Soviet soldiers and the ExComm had no knowledge of the tactical nukes. The ExComm’s thoughtful deliberation paid off. According to Schlesinger, the American invasion of Cuba could have been the start of a “global holocaust.”"," "],"display_date":"October 22, 1963 - October 28, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-25","locations":[{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":7,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3071,"tag":"ExComm"},{"id":3070,"tag":"Robert F.

New York Times reporter Wallace Turner wrote, “The other surviving brother in the family, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has told his friends that he doubts seriously if Robert Kennedy knows what he wants to do.” The press interest in Kennedy may not have been as organic as it appeared. Turner served as a Press Secretary in the Kennedy Administration. Despite Kennedy being the popular favorite among Democrats for the Vice Presidency, Johnson detested the idea of choosing a Kennedy as his running mate in an effort to forge his own legacy. ","Following the assassination of his brother, the once confident Robert F. Kennedy suddenly felt unsure of himself in Washington. RFK served as John F. Kennedy’s most trusted advisor in addition to being the Attorney General.  Although RFK remained the Attorney General for several months under Lyndon B. Johnson, RFK lacked the purpose and drive he displayed while serving his brother. RFK fell into a deep depression immediately after his brother’s death and did not report to work for weeks according to On His Own: Robert Kennedy, 1964-1968, by William Vanden Heuvel. ","Under immense internal and external pressure, Robert Kennedy weighed his options for the next chapter of his life. Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in September 1964, the press widely speculated on where RFK would end up. Vanden Heuvel, a close associate of RFK, named some of the positions RFK considered pursuing following his departure from the Johnson Administration. The positions included several ambassadorships, Governor of Massachusetts, and New York State Senator. Taking over JFK’s legacy required RFK to run for office for the first time in his life. Lacking his late brother’s charisma, RFK benefited from immense carryover support from his brother in the Democratic Party. ","RFK’s popularity in the Democratic party made him a de facto candidate for Vice President to the incumbent Johnson in the 1964 election. RFK coveted the Vice Presidency because it would give him the greatest ability to fulfil JFK’s policy goals. RFK admired the Johnson administration’s continuation of many of the New Frontier programs and legislation introduced by JFK. Much to the delight of Johnson, the same polls of the Democratic Party that showed the steadfast support for RFK also revealed that Johnson would not need RFK in order to beat Republican Barry Goldwater. ","After Johnson passed over RFK for the Vice Presidency, RFK moved north to run for a senate seat in New York. Kennedy would remain a NY Senator until his death during his campaign for the presidency in 1968. Despite not being named a the Vice Presidential candidate, RFK was able to continue JFK’s legacy of the New Frontier in the senate and later on the campaign trail before his own assassination."],"display_date":"April 26, 1964","search_date":"1964-04-26","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":12,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3070,"tag":"Robert F.
