White’s letter began with an explanation of how grateful he was to have received mail from his wife: “[I] contented myself by reading your welcome letter which afforded me great pleasure.” A few lines later, Mr. White proceeded to explain the horrors of the Battle of Sharpsburg (Antietam), which he had been involved in a few months earlier.","In his description of the Battle of Sharpsburg, White wrote, “Oh Mat it","almost makes [me] shudder to think of it how…Sept. 17 ’62 [will] live in the memory of the 32 Va. reg[iment] & its friends.” Despite all the carnage and devastation of the battle, White walked away unharmed. He viewed his survival as an act of God: “Thanks be to a kind Providence I came out unhurt but narrowly escaped. A ball passed [only] through my blanket between my body and right arm.”","The heart of White’s letter, however, is found in the remarks he made about coming home for Christmas. White acknowledged his wife’s plea for him to “get a pass to come to Mothers in the Chris[t]mas.” In response to her plea, Mr. White wrote, “I am sorry to tell you to do either [find a substitute or go home] is utterly impos[s]ible.” Although he hinted at the fact that he wanted to be home for Christmas, White understood that he had a commitment to the Confederacy. Since Mr. White was on “picket duty” in Fredericksburg and was expecting the city to be shelled by the Union forces, he had to abruptly end his letter.","White’s fear of the memory of the Battle of Sharpsburg had a lot of merit. As historian James McPherson pointed out, Sharpsburg was the site of some of the Civil War’s hardest fighting. Just as White had hinted, at nighttime on September 17, 1862, Confederate military leaders reported losses greater than fifty percent in several brigades. In addition, President of the Maryland Historical Society, Burton Kummerow, noted that about 23,000 soldiers were killed and wounded during the Battle of Sharpsburg. In regard to White’s fear of how the day would be remembered, Kummerow argued that it would forever be seen as a victory for the Union, and it eventually prompted Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Historian Stephen Sears also argued that the perceived Union victory at Sharpsburg compounded with the Emancipation Proclamation, prevented Britain, France, and other foreign agents from getting involved in the Civil War.","Aside from the Battle of Sharpsburg, White’s letter reflected emotions shared by soldiers on both sides during the Civil War. The Civil War proved to be more than just a few short battles. The physical and emotional stresses brought about by fighting, such as that at Shapsburg, gave every man a strong desire and longing for home, especially around the holidays."],"display_date":"November 30, 1862","search_date":"1862-11-30","locations":[{"id":5992,"lat":39.4722539212,"lng":-77.3980976361,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":669,"tag":"Confederate Army"},{"id":1792,"tag":"Antietam"},{"id":1793,"tag":"Virginia Infantry"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6612,"title":"\n\nLincoln Removes General McClellan From Command","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In November, 1862, a change occurred in Union power as President Abraham Lincoln removed General George McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac. <em>The New York Times</em> stated, during “the fifteen months…he has had virtual control of the war have been utterly barren of results...Few commanders in history have had such splendid opportunities, and fewer still have so ostentatiously thrown them away.” McClellan commanded the Army of the Potomac satisfactorily from 1861 until November of 1862; as the war progressed, he quickly became paranoid about the size and talent of the Confederate Army. He was never outnumbered by the Confederates, and his paranoia put him at a mental disadvantage. "," ","During the start of the Seven Days Battle of July 1862, McClellan ably commanded his army. McCllelan launched an attack on Robert E. Lee and his troops. The Federals did not make irreversible gains, but McClellan believed his troops were in control; yet he ordered them to fall back. The retreat gave Confederates the advantage of more time. Consequently, Lee and his troops defended their position and caused McClellan to retreat due to his fear of losing. After this failure, Lincoln decided to give McClellan another chance which came at the Battle of Antietam nearly two months later."," ","The night before the Battle of Antietam, McClellan believed the Confederate Army had 120,000 plus men. Stephan Sears states, “McClellan imagined three Rebel soldiers for every one he faced on the Antietam battlefield. Every decision he made that September…was dominated by his fear of counterattack by phantom Confederate battalions.” McClellan had a plan to send troops as a diversion; he believed this would prevent Lee from overtaking Joe Hooker’s division. However, he gave his orders too late, and this caused McClellan to lose control of the battle, and let his irrational fears of the Confederate Army take over."," ","Lincoln wrote to McClellan to discuss his failures and give him a chance to respond; however, McClellan failed to impress Lincoln. After his failures in battle, Lincoln wanted to appoint someone more capable to the position of Commander of the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln talked to General Ambrose Burnside about becoming the new commander. Burnside had previously been asked to accept control after his success in North Carolina, but at that time Burnside denied the offer. This time the request was coming directly from the President, making it difficult to refuse. Burnside did not believe that he deserved this position, and he accepted it with reluctance."," ","McClellan allowed his fear of failure to control his ability to succeed as commander of the Army of the Potomac. If he would have been able to think more systemically and put aside the pressure to be perfect, he may not have lost his position. He frequently overestimated the size and power of the opponent; ultimately, this led to failure. The refusal to pursue the enemy at the close of the Antietam battle and for weeks afterwards, was the last straw for Lincoln, and he removed McClellan from power. Ultimately, McClellan was replaced by General Burnside as the new commander of the Army of the Potomac."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1862 - November 30, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-16","locations":[{"id":14214,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":7,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3170,"tag":"Seven Days"},{"id":3169,"tag":"Burnside"},{"id":3168,"tag":"McClellan"},{"id":1792,"tag":"Antietam"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}}]}
