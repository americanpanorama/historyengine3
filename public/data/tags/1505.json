Lynching, commonly practiced throughout the United States from the 19<sup>th</sup> century until the 1960s, was a method of murder used to control African American behavior. The victims were typically accused of inappropriate behavior towards white women, though historians agree that these charges typically were false. Armwood’s case met with something highly unusual of Maryland lynchings up unto this point: gubernatorial intervention.","Gov. Albert Ritchie had ordered that Armwood be moved out of Somerset County to Baltimore for protection until his trial. However, relentless pressure from the whites in Princess Anne pushed Judge Robert Duer to transport Armwood back to Somerset County, where an angry mob waited for him. The mob broke through the guards and used a telephone pole to batter down the jailhouse door. The mob rampaged the jailhouse, found Armwood, and dragged him to the courthouse lawn where they beat him severely. They then dragged him through the streets into Duer's neighborhood, where they hanged him from a tree near the judge's home. Afterwards his mutilated body was set on fire and abandoned in a lumberyard where it stayed to terrorize the African American community.","Politically, Maryland was sharply divided over issues of race. In general, Baltimoreans identified more with northern progressive thought while residents of rural areas held to southern sensibilities. With the gubernatorial election on the horizon, Gov. Ritchie found himself torn between rural white segregationists on the one hand, and urban progressives and African Americans on the other hand. Baltimoreans were enraged by his refusal to take responsibility for Armwoods' lynching. In response, Gov. Ritchie declared that, “The responsibility for Armwood's being at Princess Anne rests squarely on the shoulders of Judge Duer and State's Attorney Robins.” Ritchie’s reluctance to use his power to administer justice seemed to demonstrate a broader unwillingness to improve the rights of minorities and promote a progressive agenda. In order to recover his reputation in this demographic, Gov. Ritchie sent three hundred National Guardsmen to apprehend four of the men accused of the Armwoon lynching and bring them to Baltimore for trial. This ultimately failed because Somerset residents actively rebelled.","Ritchie’s short-lived attempt to prosecute the lynchers alienated White segregationists and his ambivalence about the lynching of Armwood had infuriated African American and white progressive voters. He lost reelection. Interestingly, the Armwood lynching was the last in Maryland. That, combined with the voters' actions, suggest that Maryland politics was turning toward Civil Rights during the 1930s."],"display_date":"October 18, 1933 - October 30, 1933","search_date":"1933-10-24","locations":[{"id":23153,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":10,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"},{"id":24915,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"Somerset, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2540,"tag":"George Armwood"},{"id":2539,"tag":"Gov.

Both the city and the Railroad Company encountered a challenge in 1904, when the Great Baltimore Fire destroyed the majority of the Financial District.  The thriving company rebuilt its headquarters immediately after the fire, taking the opportunity to present a more modern image.  As transportation by train was becoming less popular and cars were becoming more relevant in society, the company took the opportunity to validate it was still relevant, through the building architecture.","The building itself has a very progressive look inside and out.  According to the Baltimore Sun, it was the richest building in Baltimore with the most up to date design.  This building was meant to make a statement that the company was here to stay and continue doing business.","The construction of the new headquarters caused quite a stir. The Baltimore Sun published an entire article about the design and what it meant for the company. As soon as people walked into the entrance of the building they were amazed by the amount of marble and bronze.  Even the celling was eye-catching, along with the polished elevator, which gave access to the 13 floors.  At the top floors the top executives could be found.  Employees enjoyed modern luxuries including, “a bathroom, with porcelain tub, tile floors and wainscotings.  The door and woodwork are of mahogany finish” (Baltimore Sun).","The outside of the building was just as impressive as the inside.  There were a variety of symbols of progress on top of the building. One of the most significant parts of the building were the sculptures, including “the Roman God Mercury, a mythological symbol of commerce; and a figure called the Progress of Industry”.  The Beaux- Arts design gained popularity during the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.  The connection to the Fair is significant because there, technolgy and the railroad were seen as symbols of American progress. And, after the fair, many government and business structures tried to imitate the fair's gradure and style."," "],"display_date":"March 1904 - March 1906","search_date":"1905-03-16","locations":[{"id":51922,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1505,"tag":"Progressivism"},{"id":2549,"tag":"Modern"},{"id":2519,"tag":"Baltimore fire 1904 MD"},{"id":2557,"tag":"Baltimore and Ohio RR"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}}]}
