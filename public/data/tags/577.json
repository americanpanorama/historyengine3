This speech was given this day after the Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Battle of Gettysburg was a three day long battle from July 1st, 1863 to July 3rd, 1863 and was a victory for the Union. President Lincoln wrote this short but simple speech after as seen in the draft of the Gettysburg Address to the Nation torn apart by war and had hopes of bringing the Nation back together again. This battle that was fought had a cemetery built there to honor the men who died there and was dedicated by President Lincoln."," ","In his speech, President Lincoln says “Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.” This part of the speech is an important part because of how it addresses both the fallen and survivors of both sides of the war, and makes the land a place for both sides to honor their dead. This part of the speech can be seen in his draft and must be of importance because he kept it in his speech and did not take it out. President Lincoln was a man who wanted to hold the country together and this shows that."," ","President Lincoln wrote this letter to the people to help them understand what had happened at the Battle of Gettysburg, and even though he was the second speaker at this event he is the one remembered not because he was the President, but because his speech was short, sweet and to the point. It made in impact that lasted for a long time by what it says and the meaning behind it. The Gettysburg Address written by President Lincoln seen in the draft was not just written once but five times. The President had sent five copies out to people for one reason or another because of how important the few words he said made a lot of difference in how people felt about what had been happening during the war."," ","The Gettysburg Address was and still is one of the most famous speeches given during the Civil War and its contents still last with us till this day the by the cemetery, to the very first sentence said. President Abraham Lincoln had it right when I decided to keep the nation together and give the land of Gettysburg to the people to remember the battle that was fought there. The speech President Lincoln gave was written five times for five different people, but the speech given at Gettysburg was the final draft of the speech seen in the primary source and is still as moving as it was during its time."],"display_date":"November 19, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-19","locations":[{"id":53027,"lat":39.8309293,"lng":-77.2310955,"zoom":8,"place":"Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":577,"tag":"President Lincoln"},{"id":3270,"tag":"Gettysburg Address"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}}]}
