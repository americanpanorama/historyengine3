Ashmead at the Christiana Riot trial clearly explained that Gorsuch was within the law and depicts the aggressive acts that was taken against an innocent man, “…within the jurisdiction of this Court, the defendant, with a great number of persons, armed and arrayed in a war-like manner, with guns, swords and other weapons, assembled and traitorously combined to oppose and prevent by intimidation…and arrayed himself in a warlike manner against the said United States.”  The statement clearly tried to place William Parker as being anti-American.  The slave owning South wanted to immediately pin William Parker as enemy of the United States.","Parker’s defense attorney Theodore Cuyler argued that his defendant did not commit treason, because he did not try to levy a war against the United States.  Next Cuyler sarcastically commented on the magnitude of the event, “Did you hear it? That three harmless, non-resisting Quakers, and eight-and-thirty wretched, miserable, penniless negroes, armed with corn-cutters, clubs, and a few muskets, and headed by a miller, in a felt hat, without a coat, without arms, and mounted on a sorrel nag, levied war against the United States.”  Cuyler made his point that if treason is defined as levying war against the United States, then how can a group of just a few people with inadequate resources possibly wage a war against the United States.","As a result of the trial, none of the people being prosecuted were found guilty of committing treason against the United States.  The jury expressed their disapproval of the murders and riot, but acquitted the men involved."],"display_date":"November 24, 1851","search_date":"1851-11-24","locations":[{"id":11229,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1566,"tag":"Fugitive Slave Act"},{"id":1565,"tag":"Christiana"},{"id":825,"tag":"Riot"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5675,"title":"The Supreme Court Takes a Stance on Fugitive Slavery and States Rights","course_id":99,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-01-01","end_date":"1842-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1837, attorney Edward Prigg was commissioned on behalf of Margaret Ashmore to recapture and bring Margaret Morgan from Pennsylvania back to Maryland. Morgan had lived in virtual freedom, but was never formally emancipated by the Ashmore family. In accordance with Pennsylvania’s Law of 1826, Prigg took Morgan before a county justice for a hearing at which the justice declined cognizance of the case. Despite this ruling, Prigg had Morgan and her children abducted back to Maryland. Prigg was charged and convicted in 1839 by the state of Pennsylvania with kidnapping under the Pennsylvania Law of 1826 which prohibited the removal of African Americans from the state with the intention of enslaving them. This law directly contradicted Maryland and Federal law, questioning the authority of the Constitution and Congress; therefore, the case was brought before the United States Supreme Court in 1842."," ","At this time, states’ rights tensions were brewing. While abolitionists were pushing for the federal government to outlaw slavery, slavery states did not think that the federal government had the jurisdiction to do so. Eight of the nine justices of the Supreme Court voted to reverse the original conviction and held the Pennsylvania Law of 1826 unconstitutional under both the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, strengthening federal power and weakening state power. While this was a win for slave states, at the same time, this ruling limited states from passing legislation in areas that conflicted with the Constitution- an issue that led to the secession of the Southern states. The result of this ruling sent Morgan and her children back into bondange. Prigg was nominated a sheriff in 1840."," "],"display_date":1842,"search_date":"1842-07-02","locations":[{"id":11362,"lat":39.9199204801,"lng":-76.7265166341,"zoom":9,"place":"YORK, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1651,"tag":"Prigg v Pennsylvania"},{"id":1650,"tag":"federal power"},{"id":1649,"tag":"state rights"},{"id":1566,"tag":"Fugitive Slave Act"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Pamphlets &amp; Pirates: Popular Print Culture in Antebellum America","school":"Northeastern University","course_id":99,"school_id":56}},{"id":6587,"title":"Edward Gorsuch and his Southern posse defeated at Christiana","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-09-11","end_date":"1851-09-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 11, 1851, Edward Gorsuch, a Maryland slave owner, and a posse of several men including Federal Marshal Kline, descended upon the house of William Parker, in search of escaped slaves. The southerners believed that with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 the retrieval of their slaves would be a swift and cooperative occurrence. However, the small Quaker town of Christiana in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and its inhabitants were prepared to fight for their own lives and for the escaped bondsmen they desired to protect .","Upon following a suspected ex-slave named Joshua Kite to the home of William Parker, a confrontation ensued. Parker forcefully refused to cooperate with those in the posse, as he recalled his conversation with Marshal Kline, “I then told him to take another step, and I would break his neck.” Worried over what events may occur, William Parker’s wife blew a horn in hopes of alerting nearby townsfolk to aid them in protecting the escaped slaves. Following the call for assistance, there came an exchange of gun shots between the southerners and those at the home of William Parker, which left no individuals harmed. According to the personal account of William Parker, he proceeded to call forth several individuals to the window of his home, repeatedly asking Gorsuch if these individuals were the men he was looking for, each of which he denied. Soon after, armed townspeople prepared to defend those they harbored, began to arrive at Parker’s home.","Among the crowd were two significant white men, a miller by the name of Castner Hanway along with a postmaster and storeowner named Elijah Lewis. According to Thomas Slaughter, the author of <em>Bloody Dawn,</em> the southern men viewed the arrival of Castner and Lewis as support for their desire to recapture the escaped slaves. Slaughter believes the concept of support from Hanway and Lewis can be attributed to their white skin color, as members of the posse viewed them as allies, united against their African-American enemies. Upon refusing to assist Edward Gorsuch and his group, the two northern men began advising the Maryland posse to leave because their safety was at risk. Following the further denial of the southern men to leave, a swift and murderous battle ensued, resulting in the death of Edward Gorsuch and the critical injury of his son Dickinson Gorsuch. “Old Gorsuch was lying in the yard in a pool of blood,” specified William Parker, “and confusion reigned both inside and outside of the house.” From this battle, a large Federal trial took place, in hopes of bringing justice to those involved in the conflict. However, according to James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, the government dropped the indictments of the individuals involved and decided not to press any further charges. This can be attributed to the lack of support in the claim that the event was an act of treason. The Battle of Christian strengthened the northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act, through its direct rebellious nature and bringing of action to those who spoke of anti-slavery."],"display_date":"September 11, 1851","search_date":"1851-09-11","locations":[{"id":11090,"lat":40.0378755,"lng":-76.3055144,"zoom":6,"place":"LANCASTER, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1566,"tag":"Fugitive Slave Act"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":825,"tag":"Riot"},{"id":1565,"tag":"Christiana"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}}]}
