Hartford</em>, neared Mobile Bay, Alabama.  The goal was to take over the strategic location which consisted of three confederate forts and a plethora of underwater mines.  The two main forts were Forts Morgan and Gaines aided by a few Confederate ships mainly the <em>C.S.S. Tennessee</em> which was an ironclad.","Admiral Farragut formed his fleet into a line that was two ships wide led by the <em>U.S.S. Brooklyn</em> because of its superior anti-mine technology.  On August 5, the fleet converged on Fort Morgan to the right of the inlet.  The <em>Brooklyn</em> fired the first shots on Fort Morgan and the battle ensued.  Unfortunately, one of the ironclads in the fleet, the <em>Tecumseh</em>, hit an underwater mine and quickly sank to the bottom of the bay.  At this point, Admiral Farragut climbed the mast of the <em>Hartford</em> and shouted the famous order “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!”","Admiral Farragut’s, next order was one to save the crew of the <em>Tecumseh</em> which sank immediately after hitting the mine.  The <em>Metacomet</em> was instructed to send a boat to rescue any survivors of the explosion.  Acting Ensign Henry Nields boarded the boat and assisted ten members of the <em>Tecumseh’s</em> crew.  The task though was not one of ease as Admiral Farragut expressed in his after action reports saying “[Nields] took her in under one of the most galling fires I ever saw, and succeeded in rescuing from death ten of the crew, within six hundred yards of the fort.”  Although the <em>Tecumseh</em> lost around ninety men, Nields’ heroism was reflected on by Farragut on multiple accounts.","Nields miraculously made it back to the <em>Metacomet</em>, and shortly after, the ship was sent to take down the retreating <em>C.S.S. Selma. </em>The <em>Metacomet</em> tailed the <em>Selma </em>north of Mobile Bay and forced her surrender.  The Union incurred a huge land and naval battle at Mobile Bay driving the confederates out and eventually capturing all three forts.  Moreover, the battle yielded a copious number of Medals of Honor for the union officers who affected the victory."],"display_date":"August 1864","search_date":"1864-08-16","locations":[{"id":285,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":1577,"tag":"Victory"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":6478,"title":"Washington D.C.

In 1991 they were invited to take part in what the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>termed “the biggest victory celebration since the end of WWII,” in Washington D.C. Despite opposition from some, the “overall mood was of jubilation” and the day was marked by a sense of “old-fashioned patriotism.”","            The conflict attracted significant levels of popular support which foreign interventions by the US had not achieved since the end of the Second World War; for the parade on June 9 1991, the U.S. Park Police estimated 800,000 people turned out in support. The parade represented a “display of the American military might” which had completed its action in the Persian Gulf in just one hundred hours. As Michael Cairo has highlighted, the First Gulf War represented a “decisive military campaign,” of which Americans could be proud.","            President George H.W. Bush shared in the celebratory spirit and highlighted the validity of US intervention on behalf of the Kuwaiti people. He spoke of the freedom which Kuwait could now enjoy because “’we dared risk our most precious asset, our sons and daughters.’” The Kuwaiti ambassador also expressed his gratitude for the American intervention, which had “ousted an Iraqi army from his homeland.” Those in attendance at the victory parade shared in this sense of moral justification as well as in the legal justification. As Majid Khadduri and Edmund Ghareeb have argued, by invading Kuwait, Iraq had violated the “United Nations’ law,” thus vindicating intervention by UN members.","            The majority of those in attendance on June 9<sup>th</sup> celebrated the quick and decisive conclusion of the campaign in the Persian Gulf; at just one hundred hours of engagement over a forty-three day period, it was a remarkably short conflict. The Vietnam War had created a sense of distrust between the American public and politicians; a distrust George H.W. Bush was aware of, in Cairo’s opinion, when he made the conscious decision to not push on into Baghdad and to instead withdraw US troops. Indeed, in many of the statements collected by the <em>LA Times</em>, the sentiments of relief amongst the public are apparent. As Ethel Hammond- one of those interviewed- commented, “’I am just glad they’re back.’”"," ","            For the first time in almost sixty years, members of the US military returning to the United States were met with a victory parade which cost an estimated $12 million and with jubilant crowds. It was a distinct divergence from the welcome which had met veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars; American attitudes had swung towards the positive regarding the US Army. "],"display_date":"March 17, 1991 - June 10, 1991","search_date":"1991-04-28","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2876,"tag":"Desert Storm"},{"id":2875,"tag":"Celebration"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1577,"tag":"Victory"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}}]}
