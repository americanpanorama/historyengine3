Icebergs tower above the deck, rising to surround the fragile ship. Every detail speaks of wondrous, consuming stillness; the ship stands resolute, set romantically against the frozen wilderness at the edge of the world. The painting is a symbolic reflection of the conquest of the natural world, a testament to the vision and resolve of humanity.","           Three years earlier, as froth lashed wooden bows, as wind filled the sails, six ships swept eastward from Virginia across the world. The United States Exploring Expedition was a crusade without precedent in its nation’s history, “one of the largest voyages of discovery in the history of Western exploration.” Its very purpose typified the systematic rationalization of the nineteenth century. It was to be an expedition of enlightenment and humanity, an exploration of the uncharted reaches of the world—and of the limits of human endurance. It was an assertion of American diplomatic presence, meant to expand both commerce and scientific understanding. The ships sailed from Hampton Roads, Virginia, in August 1838, commanded by the obsessive, overreaching Charles Wilkes. After rounding Cape Horn that February, they spent three years in the Pacific, surveying islands and charting unmapped coasts. In South America the crew witnessed the brutality of the slave trade and the secularization of an emerging generation. In Fiji two were ambushed and slain, prompting retaliation that left fifty-seven native villagers dead and entire villages destroyed. They climbed Mauna Loa and survived a hurricane in the Hawaiian Islands and celebrated the Fourth of July on the shores of Oregon. They stood in awe of the Andes and the pristine, ice-capped volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest. They established the existence of a seventh continent—Antarctica—and mapped 1500 miles of its icy shores.","            When the expedition returned to New York in the summer of 1842, however, it was largely ignored. Haunted by allegations of brutality and emotional instability, Wilkes was court-marshaled by the navy and forsaken by the people. The nation renounced its oceanic frontier and turned toward the infinite West, rendering the voyage largely irrelevant to American culture. Still, in terms of scientific achievement, the United States Exploring Expedition cannot be forgotten. The scientists brought back 10,000 distinct species of plants, animals, and coral, and fossils. Linguists and naturalists had filled entire volumes with cultural, linguistic, and ethnological insight from around the world. Cartographers had created 241 charts and mapped 800 miles of the Oregon coast. The collections formed the basis for the National Institute for the Promotion of Science and eventually the Smithsonian Institute, paving the way for the American scientific advancement that endures to this day."],"display_date":"August 19, 1838 - June 10, 1842","search_date":"1840-07-14","locations":[{"id":14406,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":695,"tag":"Antarctica"},{"id":694,"tag":"Charles Wilkes"},{"id":693,"tag":"Exploration"},{"id":692,"tag":"Science"},{"id":603,"tag":"United States Navy"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5605,"title":"Naval Air Station Sanford and Its Impact on The United States and The City of Sanford, FL","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Orlando Sanford airport stands east of state road 17-92 about twenty miles north of Orlando. Today the Orlando Sanford is a small commercial airport, dwarfed by Orlando International Airport only thirty miles away. While Orlando International may be bigger, it was a product of the Disney Empire, which moved in during the 1970s. Orlando Sanford Airport, however, was originally an important naval air base, and a direct byproduct of the Cold War. Its history is tied directly with its location and the time in which it was operational, and is an important look into Florida’s Cold War history and impacted Sanford in the decades that followed.","Commissioned in 1942, Naval Air Station Sanford, or NAS for short, was chosen as a major training and staging area for carrier-bound aircraft. During the war it had supplied pilots to about half of the US navy. After the war, the base was decommissioned and the field opened to private businesses. While it was a public space between 1946 and 1950, the field hosted the New York Giants training camp, a retirement home, a hospital, and a clothing company.","The onset of the Korean War showed that the US government still had their eyes on the field. When it reopened in 1951, NAS became instrumental in the aeronautic war effort, as well as in the onset of the Cold War. The facilities were made permanent and the runways repaired, but the most substantial addition was the on-base living facilities built in the adjacent swampland. In 1961, NAS Sanford was responsible for the first flight of the RA-5C Vigilante: a carrier-based bomber that was one of the first designed to deliver nuclear ordinance from the sea. As the Vietnam War gained momentum, the Vigilante was repurposed as a reconnaissance strike craft.","The impact on the city of Sanford, however, was far more apparent. Prior to NAS, Sanford was a rural celery farming community made up of predominantly African American residents. When the base moved in during the war, racial tensions grew as black residents were being pushed out of their neighborhoods by enlisted whites and their families. During the Cold War, the demography turned away from the historically black county. In the 1940 census, half of the population of Sanford was black; by 1960 it was only 11 percent. When the NAS Sanford was decommissioned in 1968, it dealt a massive financial blow to Sanford. The base indirectly provided jobs for thousands of Sanford citizens, and the closure eventually lead to a migration of middle class whites away from Sanford and Seminole County as a whole.","The NAS was incredibly influential in the construction of modern day Sanford. NAS Sanford was important during the Cold War as a staging area, but had unforeseen effects as an important demography shaper. Without NAS Sanford’s influence, Sanford would be a very different place than it is today."," "],"display_date":"1950 - 1968","search_date":"1959-07-02","locations":[{"id":29415,"lat":28.7169229525,"lng":-81.2362806752,"zoom":10,"place":"Seminole, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":603,"tag":"United States Navy"},{"id":46,"tag":"gentrification"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5621,"title":"<em>CSS Tennessee</em>, Confederate Ironclad Proves itself at Mobile Bay","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-08-05","end_date":"1864-08-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of August 5, 1864, Admiral David Farragut led a fleet of eighteen warships into Alabama’s Mobile Bay. Since the fall of New Orleans in April 1862, Mobile had become the major Confederate port in the Gulf of Mexico, responsible for bringing in blockade runners carrying supplies from Havana.  The result of Mobile’s rise in importance to Confederacy was a rise in the priority of its capture for the Union.  Farragut’s fleet consisted of four heavy ironclads, vessels outfitted with heavy iron or steel armor-plates, and fourteen wooden warships, including the <em>U.S.S. Hartford</em>, Farragut’s command ship.  In opposition to this fleet, the Confederates only had four vessels.  However, this included the <em>C.S.S. Tennessee</em>, a ship that was renowned as the most powerful ironclad afloat.  CSA Secretary of the Navy S.R. Mallory described the two forces in a report to Jefferson Davis, dated November 5, 1864. “A formidable fleet of the enemy, consisting of eighteen ships, including four ironclads, mounting 199 guns, crewed by 2,700 men, under Admiral Farragut, crossed the Mobile Bar, where they were vigorously attacked by the forts and by our small squadron under Admiral Buchannan.”","Despite a valiant defense, the Union fleet pushed into the bay, forcing their way past the CSA forts, fleet, and mines.  Mallory reports, “In this action, the <em>Tennessee</em> and the <em>Selma</em> were captured, and the <em>Gains</em>, in a sinking condition was run ashore.”  The secretary totaled Confederate losses at “12 killed, 20 wounded, and 243 taken prisoner,” writing to Davis that, “Naval history records few contests between forces so unequal in ships, guns, and men, and but few in which the weaker side displayed such heroism.”","Beyond the battle’s importance to the Union campaign in the South, Mobile Bay proved to be the first test of the new ironclad against heavy fire. Mallory described the assault of the Federal fleet on the CSA ironclad. “The enemy ships, some of the finest afloat, were armed with IX, X, XI and XV inch guns, whose projectiles varied in weight from 84 to 428 pounds. Their broadsides, some of the heaviest known, were discharged upon the <em>Tennessee</em> at distances ranging from 3 to 30 yards, and three of their heaviest ships, fitted as rams, ran into her at full speed repeatedly.” In defiance of such punishment, Mallory claimed “The massive strength of the frame and the sloping armor of the ship resisted these assaults, and but one shot reached or made any impression upon the woodwork of the shield, and this did not go through it.” This test, as well as the success of the Union Ironclads running under the guns of CSA forts, demonstrated that, as the secretary put it, “The resistance offered by inclined iron armor to the heaviest ordinance ever used upon the sea was here fully tested at short ranges,” proving the durability of the new vessels and the success of advancing naval technology, in both offensive and defensive capacities."],"display_date":"August 5, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-05","locations":[{"id":285,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":603,"tag":"United States Navy"},{"id":1569,"tag":"Confederate Navy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}}]}
