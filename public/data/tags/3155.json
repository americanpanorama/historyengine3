Seven pregnant women died in the year 1930 in Croydon, a borough of London, England due to their pregnancies and unsanitary conditions like those described above. One of these deaths was due to childbed fever, or puerperal fever. Another 36 mothers had childbed fever; however, they did not succumb to it.","Prior to the 20<sup>th</sup> century, almost 50% of maternal deaths were due to childbed fever. The rapid decrease in maternal and infant disease and death was primarily the result of sanitary measures that were taken such as antisepsis, hand and instrument disinfection, separate delivery rooms, and proper training of doctors and midwives on the birthing process. Before the 1930s, almost 2,500 women in Britain died from unsanitary birth conditions, over 40% of which could have been prevented. Many births were home births. Beginning in the 1930s, there was a push towards hospital births and a better standard of care for mothers. This was one of the major reasons for a decreased mortality rate in mothers and babies. The advent of antibiotics in the 20<sup>th</sup> century also helped decrease the rate of infection for mothers during the birthing process, especially since childbed fever was a bacterial infection.","The changes that were implemented in the early 1930s led to safer birthing conditions. The seven women that died due to pregnancy related complications would be reduced even further in the years to come. As mentioned earlier, the 40% of preventable pregnancy deaths in years prior were on the way to actually being prevented. The sanitary measures in hospitals lead to an overall better standard of obstetric care."],"display_date":1930,"search_date":"1930-07-02","locations":[{"id":52982,"lat":51.376165,"lng":-0.098234000000048,"zoom":8,"place":"Croydon, London, England"}],"tags":[{"id":3159,"tag":"Maternal Mortality"},{"id":3158,"tag":"Childbed Fever"},{"id":3157,"tag":"Sanitary Conditions"},{"id":3156,"tag":"Maternal Medicine"},{"id":3155,"tag":"Obstetrics"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6772,"title":"Changes in Childbirth in the United States","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-10-09","end_date":"1841-10-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A midwife arrives to a patient’s home early one brisk, March morning in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century. The patient Mrs. G is in active labor. Her waters broke, and labor is picking up quickly. Soon after, she safely delivers a baby boy. Not long after the delivery, Mrs. G feels a strong pain again, and she begins to crown another baby. She delivers a baby girl. The happy situation of a surprise twin birth soon took a turn for the worse, as Mrs. G began to hemorrhage. The midwife applied pressure and bandaged around the abdomen helped stop the bleeding. She was given castor oil and a concoction of roses, poppy syrup, and dilute sulfuric acid. Plenty of rest was prescribed to the patient. This report of midwifery in private practice shows how home deliveries were typical of childbirth for many centuries."," Early midwifery practice was the norm for childbirth through the history of mankind. Women helped ease the stress of childbirth, and educated other women on the subject. Midwives used traditional medicine and practices to help mothers and babies. Letting nature take its course and along with fewer medical intervention is more beneficial to both mother and child. Births were usually done at home with just the assistance of the midwife. Midwives faced many different issues dealing with childbirth; breech births, hemorrhages, stillbirths, placental previa, and many more. One of the biggest problems with childbirth among women was hemorrhage, according to Copeman. The physician writes of the complications that mothers face during labor and delivery and what midwives should expect. He states the knowledge midwives possess to do their jobs. Women in the United States during the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century had no forms of birth control, therefore women had many children, making midwives part of everyday life. Women during the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century were expected to take a matronly role in society.  "," ","In the late 19th century, the modern hospital emerged. Hospitals began as a space to care for patients, instead of a place for the dying. Hygiene began to take an important role in the hospitals. Patients wanted to go to the hospitals now because they were clean and sterile. With this change, labor and delivery became a hospital oriented task. Doctors were pushing women to move away from the traditional midwife practice. With the development of anesthesia, women could now deliver babies pain free. New medical techniques can help lower the risk for complications such as still births, but took away the specialized care that was once provided by midwives. Although medicinal advances may be beneficial in some instances, this took away the control women had over their bodies, many times women would deliver babies completely unconscious due to anesthesia. The medical decisions were being made by the doctors and not the women themselves. Now midwives throughout the United States are attempting to bring back the practice of midwifery to put an emphasis on natural births with minimal intervention."],"display_date":"October 9, 1841","search_date":"1841-10-09","locations":[{"id":52839,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3219,"tag":"Midwifery"},{"id":3220,"tag":"Childbirth"},{"id":3155,"tag":"Obstetrics"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
