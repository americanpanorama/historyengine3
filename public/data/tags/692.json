Icebergs tower above the deck, rising to surround the fragile ship. Every detail speaks of wondrous, consuming stillness; the ship stands resolute, set romantically against the frozen wilderness at the edge of the world. The painting is a symbolic reflection of the conquest of the natural world, a testament to the vision and resolve of humanity.","           Three years earlier, as froth lashed wooden bows, as wind filled the sails, six ships swept eastward from Virginia across the world. The United States Exploring Expedition was a crusade without precedent in its nation’s history, “one of the largest voyages of discovery in the history of Western exploration.” Its very purpose typified the systematic rationalization of the nineteenth century. It was to be an expedition of enlightenment and humanity, an exploration of the uncharted reaches of the world—and of the limits of human endurance. It was an assertion of American diplomatic presence, meant to expand both commerce and scientific understanding. The ships sailed from Hampton Roads, Virginia, in August 1838, commanded by the obsessive, overreaching Charles Wilkes. After rounding Cape Horn that February, they spent three years in the Pacific, surveying islands and charting unmapped coasts. In South America the crew witnessed the brutality of the slave trade and the secularization of an emerging generation. In Fiji two were ambushed and slain, prompting retaliation that left fifty-seven native villagers dead and entire villages destroyed. They climbed Mauna Loa and survived a hurricane in the Hawaiian Islands and celebrated the Fourth of July on the shores of Oregon. They stood in awe of the Andes and the pristine, ice-capped volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest. They established the existence of a seventh continent—Antarctica—and mapped 1500 miles of its icy shores.","            When the expedition returned to New York in the summer of 1842, however, it was largely ignored. Haunted by allegations of brutality and emotional instability, Wilkes was court-marshaled by the navy and forsaken by the people. The nation renounced its oceanic frontier and turned toward the infinite West, rendering the voyage largely irrelevant to American culture. Still, in terms of scientific achievement, the United States Exploring Expedition cannot be forgotten. The scientists brought back 10,000 distinct species of plants, animals, and coral, and fossils. Linguists and naturalists had filled entire volumes with cultural, linguistic, and ethnological insight from around the world. Cartographers had created 241 charts and mapped 800 miles of the Oregon coast. The collections formed the basis for the National Institute for the Promotion of Science and eventually the Smithsonian Institute, paving the way for the American scientific advancement that endures to this day."],"display_date":"August 19, 1838 - June 10, 1842","search_date":"1840-07-14","locations":[{"id":14406,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":695,"tag":"Antarctica"},{"id":694,"tag":"Charles Wilkes"},{"id":693,"tag":"Exploration"},{"id":692,"tag":"Science"},{"id":603,"tag":"United States Navy"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":6767,"title":"Icones Anatomicae: Reviving a Passion in Science and Medicine 400 Years in the Making","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/34","end_date":"12/31/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the year 1543, Andreus Vesalius published the <em>De Humani Corporis Fabricae</em> and revolutionized the medical landscape. The work was a masterpiece. It combined the fields of art and anatomy and cut to the core of human anatomical understanding. In order to most accurately depict the anatomy of the human body, Vesalius employed several artists and had them attend anatomical dissections and demonstrations. Their beautiful drawings were then transferred to woodblocks for printing, and here is where our story begins. The original woodblocks were lost for nearly 400 years until in 1932 Dr. Samuel Lambert, President of the New York Academy of Medicine, heard a colleague make mention of an anatomy professor at Basel who wrote of the survival of several original blocks at the University of Munich Library. An ecstatic Dr. Lambert then set into motion a series of events that would culminate in the 1934 publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae</em>.","<em>Icones Anatomicae</em> is a masterpiece in itself. It is an anthology consisting of the <em>De Humani Corporis Fabricae, </em>the<em> Tabulae Anatomicae Sex, </em>several personal letters, and a few of Vesalius’ previously unpublished works.  The publication was received with much acclaim. The influence of Andreus Vesalius and his impact on the field of medicine were already well understood in the early twentieth century, but not many knew why. Several physicians, historians, and artists decided that along with the publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae,</em> an explanation of the significance of Vesalius and his work was necessary. J.B. Saunders and Charles O’Malley held nothing back in their praise of Vesalius in their 1950 book, <em>The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels.</em> They explain that his work signaled “the beginning of modern observational science and research,” essentially calling Vesalius the father of not just anatomy, but of <em>all of modern science</em>. Saunders and O’Malley go on to compare Vesalius to the likes of Hippocrates, Galen, Harvey, and Lister. Then, in 1952, John F. Fulton published <em>Three Vesalian Essays to accompany the Icones Anatomicae of 1934</em>, hoping to further illustrate why Vesalius was so important and why the publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae</em> was such a momentous occasion. Samuel Lambert commissioned the essays in 1932 hoping to give modern context to the significance of <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>and the impact of Vesalius’ work. ","Before Vesalius, science, and specifically anatomy and medicine, lectures were taught from purely textual classic sources, such as Galen. Vesalius was the first to emphasize the importance of visual aids in scientific texts. Vesalius’ contributions to the fields of anatomy, medicine, and art have undeniable influence. Vesalius is just as notable, important, and influential as other renaissance figures. <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>and the essays, books, and articles published to accompany it attempt to outline just how much of an impact Vesalius had on modern science and medicine. Vesalius was able to revive a collective passion in medicine after a millennia and a half of stagnation. He imbued the pursuit of knowledge with a certain art. The <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>was an essential vessel in transporting that collective passion into the modern age."],"display_date":1934,"search_date":"1934-07-02","locations":[{"id":53112,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York, NY, USA"},{"id":53113,"lat":48.1351253,"lng":11.5819805,"zoom":8,"place":"Munich, Germany"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":3482,"tag":"Medical Education"},{"id":3493,"tag":"Vesalius"},{"id":692,"tag":"Science"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
