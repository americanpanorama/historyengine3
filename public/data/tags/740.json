He is one president in the long line of ex-military men to join politics. Like many, he was not especially interested in politics and more coerced into it. Taylor and his address are an important because he is one of the presidents in the run-up to the events prior to the Civil War.","Taylor received the Whig nomination for president and defeated the Democratic candidate Lewis Cass and the Free Soil candidate, Martin van Buren. He is also the last southern President until Lyndon Johnson.","Taylor's inaugural address of 1849 is a very typical political speech. He emphasizes a strong and effective military and naval presence. Being an ex-military man himself, he was also a strong nationalist. He also talks about the strong relationship the United States has with other nations and how he believes in strengthening and maintaining those friendships, especially towards France, with whom they had had a minor altercation. Taylor says he has “scrupulously avoided any interference in the wars and contentions which have recently distracted Europe.” This was demonstrated in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty signed by the United States and Great Britain.","President Taylor believed in a strong government banking system and wanted to express that the federal government should encourage agriculture, commerce and manufacturing.","Taylor's short term was dominated by the issue of slavery. Although a southern war hero who owned slaves, Taylor felt he needed to take a moderate issue on slavery. Although, he did not mince his words when talking about hanging anyone who broke the law. However, slavery does not appear as an issue in his address. The only way it comes up is when he mentions that people have been buying American-made boats in Brazil and using them for the slave trade. The idea behind The Compromise of 1850 was formulated during Taylor's time in office, yet he died while it was being debated.","Taylor was not a very effective president himself and most of the men he appointed were not very competent and effective either. Taylor, although running and winning as a Whig, did not completely suscribe to the Whig ideals and was not inclined to be a follower or puppet of the Whig Congress majority and it was that, combined with his own and his administration's effectiveness that caused his short presidency to be remembered mostly for his unusual death."],"display_date":"December 4, 1849","search_date":"1849-12-04","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":743,"tag":"Compromise of 1850"},{"id":742,"tag":"Inaugural Address"},{"id":741,"tag":"Taylor"},{"id":740,"tag":"President"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5668,"title":"The Assassination of President James A.

Garfield was shot at Baltimore and Potomac Depot, a train station in Washington, D.C. (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881). In the ladies room of the train car, two shots were fired at President Garfield, with one bullet penetrating his right arm and the other piercing his abdomen just above the right hip, near his kidney (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881).  The weapon used was an extremely heavy California caliber gun known as a “Bulldog” (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881).","The initial rumor was that ex-console Marseilles Gatto, who had been removed from office earlier, was behind the murder plot (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881). However, it was the man immediately caught fleeing the scene, Charles J. Gitteau, who was deemed as Garfield’s killer. Following the murder, Gitteau walked out of the train, passing Captain Parkee, a ticket agent who realized what Gitteau had done, jumped through the window after him and tackled him to the ground (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881). With the help of two police officers and no resistance from the assassin himself, Gitteau was arrested and taken to police headquarters continuously hollering “I did it and will go to jail for it. I am a stalwart, and Arthur will be President” (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881).","As all this commotion was occurring outside of the train, the scene inside was just as hectic. Multiple doctors monitored Garfield’s condition, giving hourly updates as they could. At some points, doctors remarked that the President might not make it. At other points throughout that day, his condition improved greatly (<em>Salt Lake Daily Harold, </em>1881). Ultimately, Garfield would survive his attack for a short period of time, but not without great suffering and pain. During the months of July and August, Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, unsuccessfully tried to locate the bullet lodged in Garfield’s abdomen with a metal detector he had specifically designed for the President (“Life and Death in the White House”, <em>americanhistory.si.edu</em>). Despite all the efforts made by Bell and other medical experts, Garfield succumbed to his injuries on September 19<sup>th</sup>, 1881, dying from an infection and internal hemorrhage “James Garfield, <em>whitehouse.gov</em>).","When a theory was brought forth, prior to the President’s passing, suggesting that the attempted assassination was a result of a calculated plot, Garfield simply just shook his head saying that “[He did] not believe it.”(<em>The Evening Critic, </em>1881). Charles Gitteau, however, did have a plan. The unsuccessful lawyer believed that the president’s political decisions were threatening the position of the Republican Party and its power within government (“Life and Death in the White House”, <em>americanhistory.si.edu</em>). Gitteau was found guilty on January 25<sup>th</sup>, 1882 and executed in June that same year “Topics in Chronicling America - The Garfield Assassination”, <em>loc.gov</em>).","Although Garfield did not sign off on any legislation while in office, his death has contributed to the development of equal opportunity in modern day American politics. In 1883, one year after the execution of his assassin and only three years after his death, the Pendleton Civil Service Act was passed by congress (\"Pendleton Civil Service Act\", <em>britannica.com</em>).  This legislation established the mechanism of permanent federal employment based on merit rather than on political party affiliation (\"Pendleton Civil Service Act\", <em>britannica.com</em>). At the time, this was a tactic to avoid an unknown, “deranged office seeker”, such as Gitteau, from ever entering politics. This is relevant to today’s society because this act eliminates corrupt practices, forcing congress members, such as presidents, to appoint people based on their credentials rather than on patronage and remain true to the American dream of equality for all."],"display_date":"July 2, 1881","search_date":"1881-07-02","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":740,"tag":"President"},{"id":178,"tag":"assassination"},{"id":923,"tag":"James A.
