The asylum’s mission was to take care of young African American children during a time in Indiana when African Americans were often “denied access to jobs, education, and charity services.”[1] Children were brought to the asylum through state admittance or by parents who lacked financial capital.  ","George Cousins, born around 1882, entered the asylum around the age of four in January of 1887. George’s father, Oliver, promised to pay the asylum once he “gets into work”[2] according to the admission records compiled by Jean E. Spears and Dorothy Paul. In November, George’s mother Mary removed him from the asylum. Mary had been released from the Indiana Women’s State Reformatory for stealing $5 from Pleasant Glenn.[3] In 1890, the Board of Guardians returned George to the asylum.","Orphanages like the IAFFCC sought to place children in suitable homes or teach them a trade. It was common for children to bounce in and out of the asylum. For instance, George went to live with “David and Patsy Heildt” in 1891 before being returned the same year for being “unmanageable.”[4]","After leaving the official registry in late 1891, George most likely lived with or nearby a relative, Maggie Ford on Tremont Avenue in Indianapolis’ Haughville.[5] However, for George, this meant being in the paper for various instances that would label him as “incorrigible.”[6] During one incident in 1902, a 19-year-old George Cousins aided by another male, tried to rob a chicken coop near Bond Street.[7] After stealing several hundreds of dollars in jewelry and silverware in 1906, George Cousins was sentenced to “two to fourteen years at Michigan City”[8] in the Indiana State Penitentiary. During his time in the state prison, Cousins had spent an unknown amount of time in the hospital for the criminally insane.[9] After leaving the State Penitentiary in 1920, George was sentenced again to long term incarceration for stealing around $2,000 worth of jewelry.[10] George passed away in 1926 from cirrhosis of the liver in Haughville.[11]","The life of George shows the various arms of the carceral state. His life paints a story on how a single African American male spent time in every major type of carceral institution in Indiana. It also shows how society uses these institutions to subjugate those who are stereotypically determined unmanageable and incorrigible."," ","[1] Cowger 1992, 96","[2] Jean and Paul 1978, 25","[3] <em>Indianapolis News</em>, December 2, 1886","[4] Jean and Paul 1978, 26","[5] WWI Draft registration card September 12<sup>th</sup>, 1918 [ancestry.com]; <em>Indianapolis Star </em>August 11, 1906","[6] <em>Indianapolis Journal</em>, September 20, 1895","[7] <em>Indianapolis Journal,</em> September 20, 1902","[8] <em>Indianapolis Star,</em> October 3, 1906; 1910 Census record of Michigan City, Indiana [ancestry.com]; 1920 Census record of Michigan City, Indiana [ancestry.com].","[9] <em>Indianapolis Star, </em>April 17, 1915","[10] <em>Indianapolis Star, </em>September 22, 1921; <em>Indianapolis Star, </em>November 13, 1921.","[11] George Cousins Death Certificate April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1926 [ancestry.com]."," "," ","Citations:","“Arrest In Terre Haute Uncovers Loot Taken Here,” <em>Indianapolis Star, </em>September 22, 1921 (Newspapers.com).","“Cousins Is Sentenced: Negro Burglar Pleads Guilty on Three Charges in Criminal Court,”<em> Indianapolis Star, </em>October 3, 1906 (Newspapers.com).","Thomas W.

At fifteen years old, she was sent there on the charge of “incorrigibility,” a status offence that sent minors to reform schools. While there, Fitzgerald, as an African American, was racially segregated into different living quarters than the white students and was “subject to physical abuse” [1].","                Despite Fitzgerald being an African American cultural icon, her story is not an uncommon one.   It was common practice to send girls with status offences and other crimes to schools meant to reform their characters.  For example, there were two different efforts for reform schools for girls of color around the time of Fitzgerald’s own incarceration: the Industrial Home School for Colored Girls, which was created in 1916 in Virginia, and a proposed Georgia school for “delinquent colored girls” that the General Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs endorsed in 1937 [2].","                In many reform schools, girls were segregated by race. Additionally, most schools featured hard labor for the sake of reforming girls’ characters [3]. For example, students at the Virginia Industrial Home School for Colored Girls performed hard labor such as farm work and hog raising for the sake of reformation. As a result, girls were only allowed to attend school half a day and then worked the farmland belonging to a member of the board of trustees, and their education consisted mainly of domestic work training [3]. Girls who were eventually paroled from the Industrial Home were forced into work with an arranged employer and the employer could return the girl at any time if the employer felt that the girl’s work proved unsatisfactory [3].","                Although these segregated reform schools no longer exist, the concept of disenfranchised education still remains. As Wald and Losen state, children who are more likely to receive inadequate education are more likely to be targeted for disciplinary actions and are therefore more likely to be discriminated against in school by getting reprimanded or punished. They continue by indicating that the groups most likely to be targeted by school disciplinary action are students of African American and Latino heritage [4]. So, students of color who are being targeted are more likely to see hindrances to their education, and this can set in motion a way for these students to be more likely targeted by prison systems for status offences.  In this way, just as Fitzgerald was considered incorrigible, students today are facing disciplinary action which can land them in prison."," ","                However, Wald and Losen state that this school-to-prison pipeline is in place because students of color are more likely targeted due to their lack of education, which has been in place since the repealing of Jim Crow laws governing school segregation [4]. And even though Fitzgerald somehow broke free from this pipeline,   the inadequate and discriminatory educational system still exists. "],"display_date":"April 13, 1933","search_date":"1933-04-13","locations":[{"id":53085,"lat":42.2528649,"lng":-73.790959,"zoom":7,"place":"Hudson, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":3359,"tag":"Incarceration"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":3404,"tag":"Ella Fitzgerald"},{"id":108,"tag":"prison"},{"id":3406,"tag":"Pipeline"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}},{"id":6731,"title":"Anti-Eugenics Arguments in the Early Twentieth Century","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"7/24/12","end_date":"8/31/15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" "," ","Most people assume anti-eugenics sentiment only started to occur after the Second World War however that is not the case.[1] As early as the 1910’s sociologists like Maximilian P. E. Groszmann and A.L Sweet raised concern about eugenics; they wasn’t against eugenics as a whole but did disagree with its use in crime and punishment.[2] There were three main arguments against eugenics at this time. Groszmann advocated that scientists did not know enough to start doing permanent damage to the gene pool.[3] Another view shown by A.L Sweet, another sociologist, argued was that proactive eugenics was unnecessary as nature had been doing it for years, as social Darwinists explained. The final argument was the international view of America’s use of eugenics which was explained most as simply persecuting different races.[4] "," ","Scientists like Groszmann and A.L Sweet argued that eugenics was being improperly used in the US legal system. Neither of them felt, as did later dissenters, that eugenics had no scientific basis. However they argued that eugenics should not be used by the legal system to stop certain men and women from being able to reproduce.[5] Groszmann puts forward that sterilization is not a decision that should be made lightly, and that if it is truly necessary, it should be a judgement made by a council of specialists.[6] As Groszmann states, “we must not forget that the purpose of such productions is purely utilitarian from the point of view of man who needs food and service.”[7]This science should be used to help man not hinder. He states that statistically there were many problems with using the numbers that had been gathered because there were as many outliers as there were “normal” people. He thought that  eugenics shouldn’t be used for “exterminating the so-called undesirables.”[8]"," ","Another view is that of Sweet, who believed that it was “common sense” that the science of eugenics was naturally occurring in humans.[9]  Sweet believed that there was room for eugenics in the world and that the “undesirables” should not mate, but that sterilization went too far.[10] He believed that human love could not be dictated by any science and that science shouldn’t try to force anything that would over time happen naturally. "," ","At the first international Conference of Eugenics in London in 1912, the United States was seen as more willing to use eugenics in the legal system than other counties.[11] In Britain, eugenics was very much class-based, but the idea of sterilizing was rejected as inhumane.[12] When states such as Texas and Kansas started to view sterilization as a more effective version of lynching, and then eugenicists like Dr Harry Sharp took it as a good way of dealing with “un-desirables,” international experts in eugenics started seeing it as a race issue.[13] Most eugenicists in Britain thought that American eugenicists had taken the science and twisted it to fit their own views on race and dominance.[14]"," ","[1]Richard Lynn, <em>Eugenics: A reassessment </em>(Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2001), 42-43.","[2] Maximilian P.
