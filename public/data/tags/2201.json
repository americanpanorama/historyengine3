She was both “afraid” and “petrified” by the event.  As the song progressed, the woman transformed her pain into a newfound sense of personal strength.  “I used to cry/ But now I hold my head up high,” Gaynor belted out in the third stanza.  The woman directly asked the man, if he underestimated her ability to move on without him.  “Do you think I’d crumble/Did you think I’d lay down and die?”  Finally, Gaynor breaks into the song’s chorus.  “Oh as long as I know how to love/ I know I’ll stay alive/ I’ve got all my life to live/ I’ve got all my love to give and I’ll survive/ I will survive.”","Historian Tim Lawrence has argued that the “black female diva” became an important figure within the disco movement.  Singers such as Gaynor were able to embrace both a deep emotional vulnerability and a fighting spirit that appealed to a wide and diverse audience. Minority groups, including blacks, women, Hispanics, and gay men, made up a substantial portion of disco’s primary listeners.  Offering these groups a sense of collective spirit, disco became what Barry Walters, a writer for <em>The Advocate</em>, described as “a public music.”  ‘I Will Survive’ fit well into this mold. It provided listeners with a message of resilience, serving as a source of inspiration for many who felt oppressed by society.  With its emphasis on being strong and moving on, “I Will Survive” became an immediate hit among disco lovers across the country.","As the sole singer, Gaynor’s voice and message were clear and direct. “I Will Survive” became an anthem for anyone who felt victimized by society.  This was especially apparent among gay men, who made up the song’s primary fan base.  As Gaynor said, “It made all the sense in the world that ‘I Will Survive’ became an anthem of the gay movement.  Who felt more oppressed than they did?”  The song’s empowered message was especially appealing in the 1970s, when newly enfranchised minorities were attempting to define themselves and show their strength.  From January 20, 1979 to May 25, “I Will Survive” held the number one spot on the pop charts, and became Gaynor’s most popular single."],"display_date":"October 23, 1978","search_date":"1978-10-23","locations":[{"id":34445,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":104,"tag":"Popular Music"},{"id":2201,"tag":"Minority Groups"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}},{"id":6312,"title":"Superman vs. Ali: Simply A Fictional Fight, or Something More?","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/78","end_date":"2/1/78","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Muhammad Ali was the first Muslim boxer to win a heavyweight title, and his fame earned him the opportunity to create a comic book plot for American readers. Ali chose to write a scenario in which he and Superman, who was unable to use his powers, boxed against each other as mortals. In fighting Superman, Ali is clearly reflecting the internal racial war that was going on during 1970’s America. He made the conscious decision to choose a superhero that was most associated with conservative American values such as equality, freedom and justice.","Siegel and Shuster had intentionally created Superman as a symbol of hope to the people during the time of the Great Depression, and gave him the alter ego of  “Clark Kent” in order to relate more with the people. As the gap between the American Dream and reality began to take a toll on the Americans in the 1930’s, Superman fought for justice and upheld the idea of the traditional American hero.","On the other hand, Muhammad Ali was a boxer, who was also known as being one of the biggest Muslim and African-American figures during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. He spoke out on American hypocrisy towards other races, and criticized how Superman was meant to be the one to speak out for justice and American values, yet there were still oppressed minorities living in America. Ali’s comic book scenario clearly puts Superman as the superior white American male against himself, standing in place for the oppressed minorities who lack equal rights. In taking away Superman’s powers, Ali is literally leveling down the playing field, which shows how unequal the whites and blacks were in America. Superman’s “superpowers” would have been a representation for the social and economical power that whites had in America and the blacks were willing to fight for. Ali’s ending, in which Superman is knocked out in two rounds, creates the controversial alternative to American society as it features a world in which both races are equal, and minorities are able to defeat white Americans.","In conclusion, Ali was trying to send the message to the public about his opinions about race and inequality in America. He struck a chord in the American public by using one of the biggest Superheroes ever created. His comic book scenario featured a black man and a white man fighting against each other, and threatened to defeat the oppressed status quo just like how he defeated Superman in the ring."],"display_date":"February 1, 1978","search_date":"1978-02-01","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2597,"tag":"Muhammad Ali"},{"id":2589,"tag":"Superman"},{"id":2201,"tag":"Minority Groups"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}}]}
