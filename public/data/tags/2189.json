Kate Cummings took up the call to become and nurse and broke the holds that Southern society placed on women of middle to upper class. Kate travled by train from her home in Mobile to different hospitals around the South assesting surgeons after the Battle of Shiloh and hepling wounded in Georgia. While Northern hospitals system was very orginized and detailed, the South was far from it. Doctors drank the medical whiskey that was to go to the patients, other women would not want to preform their duties fully and all the while Kate was receiving letters from her family urging her to levae the unsutiable lifestyle and return home.","Unlike their Northern counterparts, who were welcomed in the hospital, Kate along with other women were seen as the enemy to the male staff such as the Union was the enemy. Pushing this aside and ignoring socieyt and her parents wishes, Kate \"cleaned house\" of the staff who were not up to standards using her society roots to help with her backing.","According to society Southern women were not to see a man's body until they married. The Civil War changed that notion. Cummings helped doctors in surgery, changed dressing, and cleaned wounds. With the new exposure to the male soldiers bodies Kate, who at the time was unmarried was in for a new concept. Throughout the war she remained professional and provided care for the wounded thus saving many lives."],"display_date":"June 5, 1862 - April 7, 1865","search_date":"1863-11-05","locations":[{"id":12224,"lat":35.1460265024,"lng":-85.6297474555,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, Tennessee"},{"id":285,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"},{"id":1619,"lat":34.9035877242,"lng":-85.1380945498,"zoom":10,"place":"CATOOSA, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":2189,"tag":"Nursing"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6606,"title":"Light through the Fog of War","course_id":165,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-12-15","end_date":"1865-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many people today know about the battles and outcomes of the American Civil War, but not many know about the nurses that provided care to soldiers during and after battles. In Nashville, Tennessee in 1864, a picture was taken that depicts the common nurse during the American Civil War. The picture depicts many stories and experiences nurses had during the American Civil War as it shows the setting for medical care and methods of treatments. The photo is very detailed in how it shows the setting of medical care and treatment, it shows two soldiers covered up by many blankets in a bed with one of the beds having crutches behind it and the nurse is preparing food and medication that is being distributed to the soldiers from their bedside. The soldiers are also covered in bandages and have facial expressions of pain from their wounds they received from battle. Medical treatment knowledge wasn’t as advanced as it is today, so nurses were seen like mothers to a child or a symbol of hope as they did everything they could to help wounded soldiers. This picture was used for the Chicago Sanitary Fair of 1865 and was distributed to the eyes of the public that didn’t have a role in the American Civil War. The Chicago Sanitary Fair in 1865 used this picture because they believed it would be a great motivation tool to influence citizens to join the war effort either by making donations or taking a role as a medical care provider in the American Civil War.   ","American Civil War nurses were seen as a beacon of hope and a vital sign of health to the soldiers of the war, but there was also a sign of pride coming from the nurses as most volunteered to become war nurses as they believed it was their patriotic duty. This pride was seen as a push for more opportunity for women as nursing became more and more as an occupation for women. Even though nurses were seen as a beacon of hope and a care giver as seen back in the photo, nurses were stigmatized as many men believed that the women’s place was in the house and not out in the field as men saw women as a weaker gender. The motivation from women though was astounding as women would use their own homes as small hospitals to quarter soldiers and give them shelter and food. Nurses had many roles during the war and it wasn’t just providing medical care to soldiers. Civil War nurses also provided literacy tasks as they helped write letters to soldier’s families. These details give more depth to what nurses did for soldiers during the American Civil War and explores the challenges nurses had to overcome to define the occupation for not their time period, but for the future. "],"display_date":"December 15, 1864 - May 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-07","locations":[{"id":52979,"lat":36.1626638,"lng":-86.7816016,"zoom":8,"place":"Nashville Tennessee"},{"id":52980,"lat":41.8781136,"lng":-87.6297982,"zoom":8,"place":"Chicago Illnois"}],"tags":[{"id":2966,"tag":"American Civil War"},{"id":2189,"tag":"Nursing"},{"id":182,"tag":"Nashville"},{"id":3152,"tag":"Chicago Sanitary Fair"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6693,"title":"A Poet Turned Nurse","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","A Poet Turned Nurse"," "," "," ","Born in New York on May 31<sup>st</sup>, 1819, Walt Whitman was the second of nine children. His family was poor and he had no real schooling. He loved to read and write and studied many classics on his own. At age 12, he began a trade in printing and started writing poems. He held many jobs over the years and one was editor for a newspaper down in New Orleans called The New Orleans Crescent. While living in New Orleans during this time, he got a firsthand look at what the slave trade looked like and he was sickened by the sight. This inspired him to write, “I Sing The Body Electric”"," ","In 1861 when the Civil War began, Whitman was a freelance writer that would interview wounded soldiers in hospitals in New York. A year later, Wal Whitman’s brother was injured in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Soon Walt came down to help his brother and take care of him. When he got to Fredericksburg, he was so awestruck that he felt the need to volunteer as a nurse and care for the soldiers. He would help take soldiers to Washington D.C. so could receive better treatment. He only planned on staying a few days but ended up volunteering for the next 11 years. "," ","During this time in the Civil War, nurses received no proper training. This was a trial and error effort on the nurse’s part. They simply learned but doing. “Those who called themselves nurses learned by doing and, for the most part, gave medicines, fed patients and kept the hospitals clean.” Also during this time during the Civil War, there were fewer female nurses then there were male nurses. More times than not, male nurses were just recovering soldiers. Soon, the number of female nurses increased due to the fact that many of the soldiers turned nurses would die or become sick again. This called for an increase in the female nurse population. "," ","Unable to find a decent paying job in Washington D.C. because of his book, <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Walt was forced to take a job as a cashier. On his days off and free time, Walt spent every second he could at the hospitals tending to soldiers. His favorite hospital to visit was Armory Square Hospital. He saw the doctors and nurses as some of the best for their work but sadly many nurses did not like him for the time he spent with the patients. "," ","The war is over but Walt stays in Washington D.C. He worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Attorney General’s office. Many years later, Whitman suffered a massive stroked that compelled him to move to his brother’s home. Although Walt Whitman never regained full strength again after the stroke, he continued to write up until the day he died.

In a 1900 entry on <em>Infant Feeding</em> that appeared in the American Journal of Nursing, W.B. Thistle stressed the importance of breastmilk as compared to artificial foods. She states that taking away a mother’s breast for artificial food is “fraught with the greatest importance to the infant” and that no matter how well the artificial food is, the child’s chances for survival are greatly lessened by the change. She goes on to explain how during the early days of milk secretion, the milk is richer in fats and have purgative properties. These properties were thought to cleanse the intestines of the infant during digestion but no provided evidence showed this at the moment.","<em>Mothers and Medicine: A Social History of Infant Feeding</em>, was an entry that braced the concept around <em>Infant Feeding</em>. During this same period, Thomas Morgan Rotch, a physician during 1890-1915, as well as many other physicians, stressed the importance of human milk as well and believed that it must be a standard for any infant nutrients, but implied how it could be unfit for the infant upon specific circumstances. As stated in the entry, if the mother doesn’t nurse on regular intervals or if her temperament is “undisciplined” this could cause the milk to be unfitting for the infant. Rotch goes on to explain that since the mother and infant are completely two separate individuals, the combination of nutrients from the mother’s breastmilk may not always be satisfying towards the infant. He sought out a solution with artificial infant feeding in a way that would be uniquely suited to the infant for digestion and development.","With this being said, though infant feeding was suggested among all medical professionals, it was more accepted within the nursing world. With an another <em>Infant Feeding</em> entry being released in 1924 by the American Journal of Nursing, 24 years later than when the original <em>Infant Feeding</em> was introduced, registered nurse Sister Mary Therese drew from the medical world that infant morbidity was mainly due to gastro-intestinal diseases. She went on to apply that these diseases can only be avoided through proper infant feeding. It was explained that the natural food for an infant is its mother’s milk. A mother’s breastmilk contains vital substances that all other foods lack no matter how modified they are. She sees the denial of breastmilk towards an infant as a crime as it would destroy life itself. Sister Therese also claims that she’s seen infants dying being retrieved by their mother’s milk. If there’s a case where mother can’t breastfeed, then a “wet nurse should be procured if possible”. If that fails, then artificial feeding can then be introduced."],"display_date":"October 1, 1900 - February 1, 1924","search_date":"1912-06-01","locations":[{"id":53005,"lat":52.3555177,"lng":-1.1743197000001,"zoom":8,"place":"England"}],"tags":[{"id":3479,"tag":"Artifical Foods"},{"id":3478,"tag":"Breastmilk"},{"id":3477,"tag":"Infants"},{"id":2189,"tag":"Nursing"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
