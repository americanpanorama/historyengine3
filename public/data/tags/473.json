Although efforts were made in the newly formed free black communities to organize schools, few African Americans received any education at all before the Reconstruction Era when public schools were opened. Even then, establishments for black children were poorly financed and largely ignored. Emerging in the 1870s, Jim Crow laws ruled the educational system and schools became legally racially segregated. In 1890, the first “coloured” school building in Winter Park was opened to African American children, under the harsh conditions of the time.","In 1896, the Supreme Court decision of Plessy vs. Ferguson established separate public schools for black and white students. The decision also deprived African American children of equivalent educational advantages. “Coloured” schools had to make do with scant financial support and negligible resources. A damaged photograph from 1890 documents the opening of the first school building for African Americans in the city of Winter Park, Florida. This schoolhouse appears consistent with the common characteristics of “coloured” schoolhouses emerging across the nation- few teachers, far too many students, and clearly under-financed. Two schoolteachers pose in the photograph alongside roughly 40 students – schoolchildren who mostly are in want of shoes. The schoolchildren in the photograph range from toddler-aged to early teens- a characteristic typical of the time, as generally one teacher supervised dozens of students in all subjects, and grades.","The lack of proper and fair financing for black learning institutions affected the quality of the education provided. Teachers could not give pupils ample individual attention, and therefore students were made to work exponentially harder in order to succeed. However, as the 1890 photograph illustrates, attendance was high and both students and teachers alike were proud of their new privilege, however tainted it may have been.","The struggle for fair and equal education for African Americans was long and hard, but much progress was made through the efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) and individuals like Oliver Brown, who pushed for fairness in the education system.U.S. schools were legally desegregated in 1954 by the Supreme Court decision of Brown vs. Board of Education, which overturned Plessy vs. Ferguson, and stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” Groups of African American students like “Little Rock Nine” began to enter previously “all-white” schools, and thus began the long process of de-segregation in American public schools. Though the U.S. school system still struggles with issues relating to fair education of African American children, the nation has certainly come a long way since the founding of Winter Park’s first “coloured” schoolhouse in 1890."],"display_date":"1870 - 1890","search_date":"1880-07-01","locations":[{"id":1442,"lat":28.5174877311,"lng":-81.2997194005,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":466,"tag":"Educational System"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":472,"tag":"Plessy vs. Ferguson"},{"id":473,"tag":"Brown vs. Board of Educat"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5553,"title":"Lincoln Elementary and High School, McClennanville, SC: A Standing Artifact of Desegregation in South Carolina","course_id":91,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A photograph of Lincoln Elemetary and High School, as it still stands in McClennanville, South Carolina, an unoccupied building with boarded windows, is the starting point for this episode in American history. The photograph was taken by Rebekah Dobrasko, in 2008, as part of a master's thesis on equalization schools in South Carolina.","Across the state of South Carolina from 1951-1960, a wave of new schools known as \"Equalization schools\" were built in response to the ruling of the Briggs v. Elliot case from neighboring Clarendon County, South Carolina.","Briggs v. Elliot was eventually combined into Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned racial segregation in American schools. In 1951, however, desegregation in American schools did not appear imminent. The Briggs v. Elliot case only established that segregated schools were unequal in facilities. White schools were better funded, newer, had better books and resources, and, as Briggs v. Elliot specifically charged, school buses so that children could attend without walking many miles every day.","The solution to this inequality would eventually be, with Brown v. Board, to integrate black children into these better-funded schools, but the state was committed to delaying court-mandated integration for as long as possible. The immediate answer to the Briggs case was “equalization schools”; represented by 1950s architecture like Lincoln Elementary and High School, built in 1955, that still stands across the state.","These small, flat-roofed, one-story building were built across the state as schools for white and black children. Building all new schools was a costly solution. The County of Greenville alone built 11 new schools between 1953 and 1958. The small scale of most of these schools reflects reluctance for schools to create schools to accommodate the whole community of children, white and black.That the design of these school building was specific to the ideology of racial segregation that peaked in strength and visibility at mid-century, is evident by the abandoned and decayed state of most of these small schools today."],"display_date":"1955 - 1960","search_date":"1957-12-31","locations":[{"id":29467,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"Greenville, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1477,"tag":"equalization schools"},{"id":746,"tag":"Supreme Court"},{"id":831,"tag":"construction"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":1412,"tag":"Greenville, SC"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":466,"tag":"Educational System"},{"id":473,"tag":"Brown vs. Board of Educat"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":43,"tag":"Desegregation"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":91,"school_id":4}}]}
