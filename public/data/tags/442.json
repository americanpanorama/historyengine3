The German Foreign Office promised to pass on all pertinent information regarding their investigation into the case of Dr. Mulvihill on to the United States government. They promised the same for similar cases as well, such as that of Mr. Roland Velz, who had been similarly assaulted by two German men when he failed to salute an emblem of the Nazi party.","In these cases, the severity of the punishments may seem somewhat harsh, and also appear unusual to us due to the fact that our knowledge of the use of prison (or concentration) camps generally derives from the post-war period and not before, and we are rarely informed about non-Jewish, German prisoners.  However, at the same time that the Nazi régime was investigating and punishing the men involved in these crimes, the articles notes that there were also “problems arising from Germany’s severance with the League of Nations and the arms parley at Geneva.” Regarding the latter issue, between the years 1932 and 1933, a World Disarmament Conference was held by the League of Nations in Geneva at which the constituent countries (primarily the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany) could not come to an agreement. On the one hand, according to Historian Marlies ter Borg, the German representatives believed that their country had taken the initiative in beginning the disarmament process and asked that the others follow suit. France, however, refused to do so unless they could have a promise of “collective security” from the United Kingdom and the United States, whereby those nations would intervene if war should break out in Europe. As Borg mentions, unfortunately for France, neither of those countries were willing to do so at the time.","In terms of the former concern, Historian Colum Duffy notes that when the nations who afterward became the Axis Forces during the Second World War (Germany, Japan and Italy) were accused of “committing acts of aggression” by the League of Nations, they made known their intention to withdraw from it “in order to prevent the machinery of the [League] from functioning effectively against them.” In light of these events – and their mention in the article – it is likely that the Nazi régime made their promise to hand over the information about these cases in an attempt to alleviate (somewhat) the issues that were quickly developing at the time and would damage their international image."],"display_date":"August 8, 1933","search_date":"1933-08-08","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":806,"tag":"League of Nations"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":56,"school_id":28}},{"id":5260,"title":"Kennedy Hears from a Worried Soviet Premier","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"10/26/62","end_date":"10/27/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between 6:00 and 9:00 PM on the night of Friday October 26, 1962, the tenth day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the members of President John F. Kennedy’s Executive Committee of the National Security (ExCom) received sections of a long, emotional private message from Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev.  Khrushchev revealed the underlying logic of the Cuban Missile Crisis when he wrote, “I see, Mr. President, that you are not devoid of a sense of anxiety for the fate of the world, of understanding, and of what war entails.”  The following day, referred to by Ernest May and Philip Zelikow, editors of <em>The Kennedy Tapes</em>, as “black Saturday,” proved to be the longest and most trying day of the crisis for President Kennedy and the members of ExCom.  Kennedy and ExCom drafted a response in which Kennedy acknowledged that if a solution were not quickly found it would “surely lead to an intensification of the Cuban crisis and a grave risk to the peace of the world.”","Kennedy and Khrushchev attempted to avoid escalation during the Crisis because of the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD.  According to political scientist Donald Snow, MAD was a doctrine formulated by the Kennedy administration that relied on the fact that any state contemplating a nuclear attack on another state with nuclear capability would be deterred from attacking by the knowledge that a nuclear retaliation would cause unacceptable destruction in the aggressor state.  Snow posited that the risk of nuclear war played a major role in decision-making on both sides of the crisis, and that both sides deliberately exploited this risk in the negotiations.","The MAD doctrine may have been one of the reasons why Khrushchev sent his private letter to Kennedy, which according to historian Max Frankel gave the members of ExCom a sense of cautious optimism as they went to sleep on October 26.  It weighed on his mind as he wrote “we are of sound mind and understand perfectly well that if we attack you, you will respond the same way.  But you too will receive the same that you hurl against us.”","Historian Gerard DeGroot quoted Robert McNamara after the crisis in saying that “President Kennedy and I were deterred from even considering a nuclear attack on the USSR by the knowledge that, although such a strike would destroy the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of their weapons would survive to be launched against the United States.”  MAD has been much maligned as a nuclear strategy in the years since the Cuban Missile Crisis, but McNamara argued in 1967, “Assured destruction is the very essence of the whole deterrence concept.”   Both Kennedy and Khrushchev understood MAD as part of the underlying logic for the crisis negotiations."],"display_date":"October 26, 1962 - October 27, 1962","search_date":"1962-10-26","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5590,"title":"<b>WilliamHoward Taft Our Foreign Dependencies &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /&gt;</b>","course_id":89,"status":"P","start_date":"9/5/08","end_date":"9/5/08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The whiny dulcets tones belonging to presidential hopeful William Howard Taft argued his stance on American Imperialism from a recorded speech given on September 05, 1908 in Hot Springs, Virginia. The recording known as, “Our Foreign Dependencies: Porto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines” comes from the Library of Congress National Jukebox. Recorded on a Victor Talking Machine the recording lasted for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Besides the nasally lyrical voice of the would be president the most remarkable aspect about the recording is how well it exemplifies the political school of thought for American imperialism during the Nineteenth Century.","In his speech, William Howard Taft, argued the merits of American intervention for the developing countries: Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines. He said the following:","<em>“The Republican Party has pursued consistently, the policy originally adopted with respect to the dependencies that came to us as a result of the Spanish War. The material prosperity of Puerto Rico and the progress of its inhabitants towards better conditions in respect to comfort of living and education, should make every American proud that this nation has been an efficient instrument in bringing happiness to a million people. In Cuba, the provisional government established in order to prevent a bloody revolution, has so administrated affairs and initiated the necessary laws, as to make it possible to turn back the island to the lawfully elected officers of the republic in February {intelligible} assembly has justified itself both as an assistant in the government of the island, and as an education and the practice of self-government to the people of the island. We have established a government with effective and honest executive department and a clean and fearless administration of justice. We have created and our maintaining a comprehensive school system, which is educating the youth of the island in English and in industrial branches. We have constructed great government public works, roads, and harbor. We have induced the private construction of 800 miles of railroad. We have police the island so that their conditions as to law and order is better now than it ever has been in their history. It is quite unlikely that the people, because of the dense ignorance of 90%, will be ready for complete self-government and independence before two generations has past. But the policy of increasing partial self-government step-by-step as the peoples shall show themselves fit for it - should be continued. The proposition of the democratic platform is to turn over the island as soon as a stable government is established- this has been established. The proposal then, is in effect to turn them over at once. Such action would lead to ultimate chaos in the island and the progress among the ignorant masses and education in better living will stop. We are engage in the Philippines in a great missionary work that does our nation honor, and its certain to promote the most effective way the influence of Christian civilization it is coward-less to lay down the burden until our purpose is achieved.\"</em>","What began as American policing in Cuba to stop a revolution soon evolved into an era of re-civilization <em>by</em> post-industrial hands at the expense of neglecting and disregarding the norms of Philippine culture. To Taft, and his Republican Party, the native people were ignorant who needed the lawful hand of American justice to right their wayward life. Like a manual to a machine, there needed to be a step-by-step process in order to civilize the Philippines.","The justification for all of this relied on the residue of Manifest Destiny - the American Christian code to civilize the uncivil states. Taft recognized the influence of missionaries and likened them to the promoters of national honor. The strength of the nation was its missionary efforts, at least according to Taft.","Throughout his speech, the undercurrent of American exceptionalism remained obvious. Taft’s references about the native population as being “ignorant” revealed his narrow-mindedness. It reflected his Republican Party’s ethnocentric ideals. He assured the listening public that it was the Republicans and not William Bryan James’ Democrats who advocated and achieved a lawful way of life in these foreign lands.","Taft’s call to action for missionaries to take on the burden of civilizing the island, demonstrated another example of the blatant exceptionalism (if not racism) created from his generation. He reasoned it required strength and not weakness to continue their Christian duty. He ended his speech with a simple reminder the process of civilizing the island was still a work in progress."],"display_date":"September 5, 1908","search_date":"1908-09-05","locations":[{"id":50885,"lat":38.0586957348,"lng":-79.7410797292,"zoom":9,"place":"Bath, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1531,"tag":"American Intervention"},{"id":1530,"tag":"Foreign Dependencies"},{"id":1529,"tag":"William Howard Taft"},{"id":1528,"tag":"Political Speech"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Industrialism and Imperialism","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":89,"school_id":49}},{"id":6287,"title":"Nicaragua Applauds Commodore Pauling for Capturing William Walker","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-01","end_date":"1858-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 31,1858 the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua wrote to United States Naval officer Hiram Paulding concerning his role in the capture and removal of the American filibusterer William Walker from Nicaraguan soil. In the letter, the government of Nicaragua applauded Paulding for his actions and informed him that “the [Nicaraguan] minister plenipotentiary in Washington was expressly directed to make known to the government of the United States that Nicaragua approved with full satisfaction the capture on its own territory of those revolutionist [Walker and his men] by the naval forces under your [Pauling’s] orders.”","In the months after Paulding’s December 1857 seizure of Walker, the capture’s actions had been called into question. Upon being returned to the United States Walker, who had previously studied law, took his case to the press. As summarized by historian William O. Scroggs, Walker  “coolly discussed Paulding’s invasion of the territory of a friendly power and his insult to its flag.” He then began to make claims that “It was the duty of the American Government…to return his men to the place from which they had been forcibly removed, and to salute the flag of Nicaragua for the insult it had received.”","While obviously overplaying his concern for Nicaragua’s national honor, Walker’s argument and his cause found favor with many in the southern masses including several southern congressmen. In fact, according to historian James McPherson, Georgia representative “Alexander Stephens urged the court-martial of the commodore who had detained Walker [Paulding].” Stephens was not alone in his views. No less than “two dozen Southern senators and congressmen echoed this sentiment in an extraordinary congressional debate.” The future of Paulding’s military career seemed uncertain.","Nicaragua was not oblivious to these ongoing debates. In the March letter to Paulding, the Nicaraguans expressed the “deep pain” felt by their government upon hearing “that the partisans of filibusterism have endeavored to blacken your [Paulding’s] conduct.” It is perhaps in response to these pains that the letter was written. By ensuring that “the grateful voice of the [Nicaraguan] government, of the people of Nicaragua, and all Central Americans rendering thanks to Commodore Paulding” gained a hearing by the American Congress, Nicaragua hoped to help save the career of the Naval officer who a few months earlier had helped to save them.","William Walker’s filibustering escapades in Central America were not over. In his final attempt at Nicaragua the British Navy captured Walker and turned him over to Central American authorities who were far less tolerant of the filibuster’s conduct. In the words of McPherson, “on September 12, 1860, the grey-eyed man [Walker] met his destiny before a Honduran firing squad.”"],"display_date":"December 1857 - March 1858","search_date":"1858-01-29","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"},{"id":1418,"tag":"Nicaragua"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":2554,"tag":"Alexander Stephens"},{"id":2553,"tag":"Hiram Paulding"},{"id":2552,"tag":"William Walker"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6355,"title":"American Foreign Policy and Tibet Since 1950","course_id":141,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/50","end_date":"10/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Introduction -","Less than a year prior to the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, the United States Congress issued His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama the congressional gold medal. Shortly before congress's decoration of the Tibetan leader-in-exile, Chinese authorities tightened security in the Tibet Autonomous Region and threatened action against Tibetans celebrating the region's Great Prayer Festival.  Less than a year later, mass protests broke out in Lhasa, and for the first time in Tibet's history under the Chinese, protests both nonviolent and violent spread beyond the actual physical designations of the Tibet Autonomous Region.  China'a alleged and, in some cases, documented civil rights abuses against its Tibetan subject has become an important source of international contention, and","Background -","In October of 1950, an estimated 40,000 People's Liberation Army Soldiers charged into what was, at the time, the autonomous and sovereign country of Tibet.  Within two weeks, Tibet's soldiers surrendered, and the Dalai Lama capitulated to the Chinese by signing the 17-Point Agreement, an agreement that did not explicitly delimit Tibetan autonomy, but provided a precedent by which China's communist party could take over the administration of the region.  By 1959, the Dalai Lama had been forced into exile, and China had began pursuing an agressive assimilation policy.","In 1966, Mao's Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of thousands of temples and monasteries and the prohibition of Tibetan Buddhist practices.  Many Tibetans were wrongfully imprisoned, tortured, and in some cases, executed.  The cultural revolution ended with Mao's death in 1977, after which the Chinese government eased cultural restrictions in Tibet and attempted to boost the region's economy with a number of subsidies.","Since then, it can be argued that the Chinese have pursued more aggressive methods of cultural and economic control over ethnic Tibetans. Today, ethnic Chinese generally recieve better economic opportunities, education, and health care than do Tibetans, and this is especially true in Tibet where Chinese policies have made emigrating especially lucrative for their Han population.","American Foreign Policy","In 1950, the United States was already actively advising the Dalai Lama to flee Lhasa due to US intelligence anticipating a communist takeover from China.  By the late 1950s, the U.S. government would not commit to an official role in the conflict.  However, the CIA did have a program for aiding Tibetan resistance groups against the encroaching Chinese.  However, as former Chamdo resident Lhatsun Labrang Chandzö has pointed out, resistance groups, were often poorly managed and members were often relegated to finding ways to feed themselves instead of conceptualizing and executing forms of resistance. Because of this, the US took in a number of operatives and trained them in Colorado prior to smuggling them back into Tibet in order to subvert and sabotage the Chinese.","As the Dalai Lama's brother, Gyalo Thondup, a man who was heavily involved with the CIA during the early resistance movement of the 1950s, has stated, the CIA's actions were largely ineffective, and were aimed less at establishing independence for Tibet and more at annoying the Chinese.  Thondup has stated \"It [the CIA] had no far-sighted policy for Tibet...Whatever help they provided really provoked the Chinese.  It led to reprisals.\"  Cold War historian John Knaus agrees with this assesment in an essay published in MIT's Journal of Cold War Studies: \"The US policy of 'doing anything to get in the way of the Chinese' still prevailed, and the CIA's plans to continue its support to the surviving insurgents were supported by both Congress and the State Department.\"","By the early 1970s, the United States began scaling back the CIA's efforts in the region due to new opportunities to normalize trade relations with a rapidly modernizing China.  Thondup has stated that the CIA promised the Tibetans independence should they choose to work with Americans over the USSR, and has also stated that Moscow contacted him numerous times to tell him that Langley and Washington would eventually betray Tibet in favor of a stable trade relationship with the Chinese.","Since then, as Tibetologist Melvyn Goldstein points out, the United States has carefully balanced between ideologically supporting the Tibetan government-in-exile's right to autonomous rule in the TAR and recognizing China's claims of sovereignty over the region.  While the U.S. government will often acknowledge that Tibetans have a right to autonomous rule, officials are careful not to acknowledge publicly that Tibetans have a right to sovereign rule over themselves.  This has led to numerous instances in which percieved congressional shows of solidarity with the government-in-exile are taken by Tibetans within and outside of Tibet as proclamations of Tibetan nationalist support from the U.S. government.","In 1987, reacting to a new global initiative by the Tibetan government-in-exile, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that sought to publicly denounce human rights violations in Tibet, thus issuing a new era in American foreign policy toward Tibet.  The Dalai Lama was then invited to speak at the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus, where he reiterated that Tibet was a sovereign nation being illegally occupied by the Chinese.  Goldstein argues that this was one of the major catalysts that led to the Tibetan riots of 1987 less than a week after the Dalai Lama's speech.  He makes the argument that Tibetans percieved the leader in-exile's speech to American congress a declaration of support for Tibetan nationalism by the American government, and that this perception led to protest movements throughout monasteries and communities in Tibet shortly thereafter.","Again, however, the United States' show of solidarity with the Dalai Lama was not sincere in the sense that Congress pursued active changes in the dialog between China and the Tibetan governent-in-exile.  Again, national interest and trade agreements took precedence over human rights concerns.  From this viewpoint then, it was not surprising to see Congress award the Dalai Lama a high honor prior to the Beijing Olympics, similar in the way it was not surprising to see unrest in Tibet some months afterward."],"display_date":"October 1950","search_date":"1950-10-16","locations":[{"id":52676,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":41,"tag":"China"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":141,"school_id":68}},{"id":6483,"title":"Kennedy Establishes the Peace Corps","course_id":150,"status":"P","start_date":"3/1/61","end_date":"3/1/61","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 1, 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10924 which stated the United States Peace Corps held a mission “to promote a better understanding of Americans and to foster a better understanding of other cultures among Americans at home.”   The Kennedy Administration created the Peace Corps as an agency in the State Department with the goal of training American men and women to serve in economic aid programs in countries around the world.  Through the signing of Executive Order 10924, President Kennedy simultaneously tried to spread good feelings of western democracy to amenable third world nations and increase the global experiences of young Americans through service.","In October 1960, Kennedy introduced the idea of a Peace Corps in an overnight trip to the University of Michigan less than a month before the 1960 election.  He proposed the idea of students spending their post-college years in suffering countries to recognize that there was a greater purpose in life than gaining an economic advantage at home.  While thousands of Americans joined the Corps, mixed reactions from countries around the world arose.  Despite the variety of responses to the establishment of the Peace Corps from the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, President Kennedy gave the United States an opportunity to market itself as a leader in global public service. ","Journalist Michael Hall of the <em>Journal of Third World Studies</em> viewed the U.S. Peace Corps as “an instrument of Cold War policy,” and thought it helped improve the international view of America and its relationships and intents in third world countries.  Hall, who examined the long-term impact of the American agency forty-six years after its establishment, also called the Peace Corps a “powerful symbol of American values.”  Hundreds of thousands of Americans changed their lives through their service in the Peace Corps.  Troy Moon of the <em>Pensacola News Journal </em>found evidence of life-changing service among Peace Corps veterans in Florida.  They felt that they answered the call to serve from Kennedy.  Janet McIndewar, a former volunteer, stated that “the real goal [of the Peace Corps] is to bring back what you learn and share it with people [in the U.S.].”  Those volunteers developed an appreciation for their work and even found that it transformed their lives when they returned to the states.  McIndewar’s son even joined the Peace Corps after being inspired by his mother’s work.  According to Hall, sixteen months after the signing, 2,816 volunteers were serving in twenty-eight host countries across four continents.   "],"display_date":"March 1, 1961","search_date":"1961-03-01","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"}],"course":{"name":"JFK: Famine to New Frontier","school":"Marist College","course_id":150,"school_id":77}}]}
