Before 1960, equality was just a thought being pondered by every woman in America, but now women felt they had to fight for equal rights. One of these woman was author Betty Friedan who through her writings changed the way we view equality.","On February 19, 1963, Betty Friedan started the “second wave feminism” movement with her book The Feminine Mystique. The Feminine Mystique was a book that encouraged women to seek new roles and responsibilities, and to seek identity both personally and in the workplace. Soon after it’s inception The Feminine Mystique was a pivotal point in the fight for women's rights. “Chosen motherhood is the real liberation. The choice to have a child makes the whole experience of motherhood different, and the choice to be generative in other ways can at last be made, and is being made by many women now, without guilt.” Friedan’s book finally made it possible for woman to work outside of the house and at real jobs. Three years after Friedan’s book, in 1966, 28 woman including Betty Friedan herself established the National Organization for Women. Since then NOW has been responsible for many of the major changes to the equality of women, Including the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. “Through more than five decades of activism, Friedan showed the ability not only to formulate feminist theory but also to develop her thinking response to social and cultural change. This has made her one of the most significant political and intellectual leaders in the 20th-century feminism.” This quote from the Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics by Lynne Ford shows the impact that Friedan had on the second wave feminist movement and how she changed the world for all women."," "],"display_date":1960,"search_date":"1960-07-01","locations":[{"id":32057,"lat":39.4750359792,"lng":-74.3341472584,"zoom":9,"place":"Atlantic, New Jersey"},{"id":31817,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1760,"tag":"Gender Roles"},{"id":1759,"tag":"Girl Power"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}}]}
