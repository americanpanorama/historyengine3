S. Chamberlain had a problem on his plate back in the mid-twentieth century.  Everyone sought cheap labor in the steel and coal industries, but feared employing certain groups of people because of their behavior.  Blacks treated with trepidation were the majority of workers in these industries.  For the most part, blacks saw nothing but discrimination and fell under the watchful eyes of white owners.  Chamberlain sought to employ more blacks, and to encourage other corporations to do so as well.  However, his peers felt that he must be disillusioned in his pursuits.  In a letter to other owners not only in Tennessee, but to Pennsylvania, and even into the Deep South, he conveyed his position on the matter.","“Around the furnaces, the great bulk of labor is colored labor, it is almost entirely so about the blast furnaces.  As far as experience goes, we have found it is by far the best labor in the South.”  How could one man be so sure of his predicament, and yet, everyone else saw black labor as a necessary evil?  It would seem that racial tensions kept most blacks in the hard, dirty, and underpaid jobs.  While Chamberlain employed these men in the same positions, he had “great success” in his endeavors.  A good number of black laborers had been on the payroll for nearly twenty years, that they “give great satisfaction,” in their duties.","This “great satisfaction” was beset with problems, of course.  Chamberlain’s white employees were extremely prejudice, and fought to keep blacks out of the skilled positions by not agreeing to teach the trade to the black workers.  Though, this is not uncommon in the South, the majority of skilled labor was delegated to the white workers because of racial discrimination.  However, Chamberlain goes on to discuss that it was this prejudice that inhibited the black men’s advancement, not their skills.  Chamberlain goes further, pointing out that as “puddlers,” black men were just as capable.  “Puddling” involved stirring the molten contents of a furnace from above with iron rods, it was one of the most dangerous and hard jobs in the “puddling” style furnaces.  “Fully as good as white men; their yield is as good; they are as steady workmen; they are as reliable in every way, and their product is fully as good as anything that we have got from white labor.”  But the quality of the black laborer’s work wasn’t the predominating factor in where they worked.  If a black man was given a “white man’s job,” white workers had a tendency to lash back with violent strikes…barring whites and blacks from the workplace until they had the matter settled.   So it was not that blacks were unable to do work correctly, or lacked the basic skills to learn and achieve, but it was the racism that divided and segregated their opportunities.  One other man had much the same opinion as Chamberlain.  T. D. Aldrich was a northern industrialist that had moved to Birmingham, Alabama to work as a supervisor.  Aldrich agreed that blacks “as a class are, without exception, the best labor I have ever handled.”","Of course there are always dissenters to an ideal.  J. W. Sloss, the head of the famous Sloss Furnace Company in Birmingham, Alabama, believed “there would be no improvement to substitute white labor for black workers.”  Sloss, like many others, thought that replacing white workers with blacks was a mistake because it raised racial tensions for no reason.  Many would point to this and say that things were done in this way just to keep the workplace at ease, that it wasn’t a racially motivated matter.  However, more than enough evidence shows that blacks were hindered in progress mainly because white workers discriminated heavily against them.  Even the National Labor Union –created in 1866- questioned whether black laborers should be allowed to work in industry because of the racial problems it would create.  Also, there was still the belief that blacks were subservient to whites, harder to educate, and more base in their dealings.  These beliefs were a circumstance that played over and over itself, even to this day.","Throughout history, there has always been a culture or race that was treated as less worthy than their counterparts.  Here in the South it was especially rough on black laborers, however, the northern industries suffered because of these tensions as well.  Blacks would be hired, whites would strike and make demands, and things would be resolved for the good of the business…which often ignored what the needs of the blue-collar black laborers that did the majority of unspecialized work in the coal and steel industries."],"display_date":1950,"search_date":"1950-07-02","locations":[{"id":29463,"lat":35.1808732525,"lng":-85.1648090186,"zoom":9,"place":"Hamilton, Tennessee"},{"id":28563,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1011,"tag":"Ethics"},{"id":1661,"tag":"Coal"},{"id":906,"tag":"Steel industry"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":1665,"tag":"Steel"},{"id":1666,"tag":"Coal Industry"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":1668,"tag":"Racial Tension"},{"id":1669,"tag":"South"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5703,"title":"A Defensive Policy Unheeded","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Very infrequently do presidential policies go unnoticed around the world, and especially not so within the United States itself.  However, during the greater part of the Second World War, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s positions on racial issues in the workplace were heard and often times not upheld.  Black workers were barred from facilities producing wartime goods throughout the country.  Munitions, Jeeps, planes, tanks, and “Deuce and a Half,” tracked vehicles were being turned out left and right in the effort to equip the massive numbers of U.S. soldiers on the battlefield around the world.  Many in history have called these workers at home the “Second Front,” of World War Two, the people that made victory possible through mechanization.","In many instances black workers were barred from working in certain positions in industry, and in others, locked out of facilities altogether.  Roosevelt in his great forethought made it government policy to allow a man of any race, religion, or ethnicity to work wherever possible if they had the skill set required.  Even though Roosevelt set up these conditions, many large defense contractors turned a blind eye and proceeded as they had for years.  Dock workers were going on strike for fair wages and work conditions, black men were discharged from work and the result in many instances was the entire black workforce walking out during business hours.  Sadly, much of his buttressing on racial problems in the workplace did little in the way of governmental bodies.","Roosevelt saw the racial lockout and weakness of the unions to govern grossly upsetting, and went about contacting his staff to spread the practice of equality.  In a memorandum addressed to William S. Knudsen (Ford Motor Company, and GMC) and Sidney Hillman (head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America), Roosevelt expressed his opinion on the matter rather flatly.  “ [The] discrimination against Negro workers has been nation-wide…[they] are being turned from the gates of industry on specifications entirely unrelated to efficiency and productivity…this situation is a matter of grave national importance, and immediate steps must be taken to deal with it effectively.”  Roosevelt goes on to state that “Every available source of labor capable of production defense materials must be tapped in the present emergency.”  He saw the discrimination for what it is: an uneducated and backwards, racist sentiment left over from the previous century.  He urged unions and labor leaders like Knudsen and Hillman to take into account the huge numbers of skilled black workers to increase war-time productivity.","Of course, this did not guarantee success, nor did his Roosevelt’s words fall only on discerning ears.  Many times the policies of different workplaces caused racial tension and strikes throughout the country.  In Mobile, Alabama, one of the South’s biggest shipyards and transportation hubs, more than a few strikes crippled production.  For instance, the Mobile Pulley Works was halted in August of 1942 over racial discrimination.  Eighty percent of the workers of the Mobile Pulley Works were black laborers.  During August, several black workers were discharged from work for varying small incidents.  The main incident in question was that of the Financial Secretary of the local “colored” union was fired.  The unnamed Fin. Sec. was off work for three days following a death in his immediate family, and upon returning to work he was told that he must leave, and would not receive his job returned.  This ended up putting his family on the street within days of loosing said position.  The day he was fired, the story circulated throughout the Works and caused an uproar that ended up with all the black workers leaving work to strike at the gates.  In effect, the lack of workers caused much strife in the production of war materials.  The Mobile Pulley Works created pulleys, winches for Jeeps, gears for war machinery, but also produced a number of artillery pieces and artillery rounds themselves…so it is easily seen just how needed their business was during WW2.  In the end, the Work’s unions were able to settle with the business and put its men back to work for the war effort…of course, this strike would likely never had happened if Roosevelt’s policies were actually observed without question.","Many laws and policies have been challenged in the course of the United States’ existence.  From slavery, education, and work, all the way up to social issues and tearing down barriers with the outside world.  It is quite disconcerting to know that a man so responsible for this nation’s continued being was heard and not observed. Of course, such is the way of social, political, and racial advancement in the world today; we must take strides to make better the future for others."],"display_date":"1940 - 1945","search_date":"1942-12-31","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":25291,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1684,"tag":"Unions"},{"id":1683,"tag":"Black Workers"},{"id":1682,"tag":"Roosevelt"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

Big shifts such as mass movements from different regions in the U.S., notably African American’s “Great Migration” from the South to the North. Around 6 million black migrants were redistributed among the Northern and Western cities later to die down around the first World War.","A popular destination for these migrants was Chicago, Illinois. A few letters from the “Great Migrations” chapter of <em>Major Problems in American Urban and Suburban History </em>were compiled from 1917. Two of the letters (both from anonymous sources) are prime examples of the different stages of the relocation to Chicago. The first letter is from a black man living in Louisiana  asking the <em>Chicago Defender </em>for “passes” to the North. At the time, <em>the Defender </em>was a widely popular literary journal that emphasized the negatives of racial discrimination and was a strong activist source for civil rights. He explains that he, like many others, has a family to take care of and has heard/read of great job opportunities in Chicago. He also mentions the displeasure from “white folks” that many blacks were looking North for opportunities. He writes “Please dont publish this because the white folks are angry now because the negroes are going North.” Many white southerners were upset about the loss of labor to the promise of “freedom”.","In the second letter, a black woman who has already moved to Chicago tries to persuade her sister to move her family to Chicago. She tells her that “people are rushing here by the thousands”and there is good money in being a landlord, on account of all the needed housing for the incoming migrants. She writes of the job she and her daughter have at a meat packing warehouse where she makes $1.50 a <em>day. </em>However, she feels the Lord has brought her and her family to Chicago.","Job opportunities weren’t the only motivation for this Great Migration. A general sense of true “freedom” was felt with living in urban cities, particularly Chicago. Polls were taken and the responses about Chicago living were all generally the same: freedom, voting rights, better opportunities, no “dictation” from the white people. A particularly shocking response from a black migrant stands out: “Can vote; no lynching; no fear of mobs; can express my opinion and defend myself.”","Another big pull factor was the widespread grouping together of blacks in urban areas. James R. Grossman states “it is likely that eventually most black southerners who decided to go North... chose a destination based largely on the presence of kin and townsfolk.”","Overall, Chicago was an incredibly enticing city for those oppressed black southerners."," "],"display_date":"1917 - 1922","search_date":"1920-01-01","locations":[{"id":17541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":81,"tag":"Great Migration"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":827,"tag":"Chicago"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5767,"title":"The American Asian Perception","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As Asians began to migrate en masse in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the US government passed laws heavily restricting this trans-pacific immigration. This migration became known as “The Yellow Peril.” The Chinese Exclusion Act and the Immigration Act of 1924 both halted the growth and development of the existing Asian minority groups present in the US.[1] This anti-Asian sentiment became more focused at the advent of World War II, and was distilled and directed toward the Japanese. Propaganda ensued and, three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese internment commenced. All Japanese-Americans and anyone of Japanese descent on the west coast of the US were herded into internment camps or forced to leave their homes. At this time the Japanese were depicted and thought of as sub-human and deceitful. [2]","This Anti-Japanese meme shifted the focal point of Asian hatred onto the Japanese, and popular media depictions of other Asians, particularly the Chinese, became less negative.[3] The Chinese were also being invaded by the Imperial Japanese military. This common enemy led some Americans to believe the US should not only combat Japan, but assist China in doing so. While the US never sent direct military support to China, they began airlifting supplies to the Chinese in an attempt to relieve some military pressure. The American dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan led to their complete surrender, and simultaneously ended the second Sino-Japanese War.","The changing attitudes towards Asians can be seen in popular media of the era, such as the cartoon strips of Milton Caniff. Caniff’s character, The Dragon Lady, is a strong, beautiful, Asian woman who acts as the primary antagonist of Caniff’s strip <em>Terry and the Pirates</em>.[4] When the Sino-Japanese war breaks out, The Dragon Lady joins forces with Terry to hinder and conduct operations against the Japanese on Chinese soil.

Many citizens from all throughout the state came to visit and inspect the new developments progress. This community was unlike any other housing development of this time since all the houses were going to be “owned and peopled by Negro citizens.”  The Washington Shores community was going to be one of the first developments in the nation to start “setting a pattern… for meeting the housing shortages of minority groups, especially Negros.” ","The concept for a Negro-owned community was created in 1947 when John Graham, a tile manufacturer in Central Florida, was faced with the task of finding housing for a Negro employee of his. Appalled when finding that White landowners were charging outrageous rental fees in African American areas of Orlando, Graham gained aid from the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and the city government to help ease “congested quarters of the Orlando Negro section” by establishing a non-profit organization to fund the housing development. Segregation of white and black housing communities in this era was a major issue, often “during the 1950s urban expansion…discriminated forced blacks into small, disconnected communities and to travel longer distances for goods and services than did whites.” Thus, the idea of a Negro-owned community close to the hustle and bustle of Orlando was met with excitement.","The development of the Washington Shores community “presents a remarkable case study of civic cooperation.” Throughout Orlando, citizens and businesses contributed to the development of the housing. The Orlando legislature expanded the city limits in order to ensure that the community would have adequate fire and police protection, as well as necessary utilities, such as sewer, electricity, and paved streets. And a Negro real estate firm was given the job of handling the sales of all housing. The aid of the city came with the assurance that this community would not soon become a “slum.","The cost of buying a home in Washington Shores ranged from, five hundred dollars for a normal lot to one thousand for one on the lake shore, with a down payment of $125. Most homes in this community were planned for a five or six-bedroom layout. This low pricing of a home in the 1950s was unheard of, but for many African American families, this was a struggle. Yet, the cities cooperation with the development of Washington Shores aided many African Americans planning on moving to this community, the First National Bank of Orlando gave financial aid to those purchasing homes in the community. ","The Washington Shores community of Central Florida was met and enjoyed with wide appeal.

They are some of the greatest African Americans to step foot on a baseball field. Some refer to them as “freaks of nature” because of their playing abilities. Today in Major League Baseball, about 8.5 % of the players on opening day rosters are African Americans. We all know that there was a time in America when African Americans weren't allowed to play baseball. But when were they allowed into the sport of baseball?"," ","It all began in the late 1800s. African Americans first began to play baseball on college, military, and company teams. As time progressed, blacks somehow made it into the professional stage of baseball. There is no record of who the first black baseball player was, but the first black to reach the Major Leagues was Jackie Robinson. Around the 1800s there was a lot of racial prejudice. Some people could only imagine how blacks were treated on and off the field considering that there were people who absolutely didn’t want them play baseball. Those people where whites in the U.S."," ","Because of the amount of racial prejudice floating around it was hard for players to play the game with comfort. What I mean by this is that players couldn't play the without worrying what would happen to them if they played better than a white player. During this time, if a white player saw that a black player had potential, he would do things like “spike” them during a game. White players used the tactic of spiking to injure African American players. This is done during baserunning and sliding into other bases. If a white player was running bases, he would try to step on the back of a black player's ankle or leg, leaving a huge gash or maybe even breaking the player's leg."," ","Blacks had their troubles off the playing field as well. For African Americans, they were treated the same as they were within the playing grounds. In some cases they were treated worse. For example if a team went to a restaurant and they had a black player on their roster, sometimes they were refused of service and asked to leave. In other cases they were allowed service, but if the black player were to go to the bathroom alone, sometimes customers would go to the bathroom just to threaten them or even assault them. Because some of the players may have had families, whites would go to their homes and bust the windows out while they were sleeping. Not only did whites bust windows out, they tried to set their homes on fire as well.","As time progressed,  people began to see the potential in black baseball player's. Although their potential began to be recognized, there were still some instances where player's were heckled by whites in the stands and off the field. After a while,  some whites began to realize that racial prejudice was wrong and that African Americans aren’t what they perceive them to be. The Only thing that blacks ever wanted was the equal opportunities as other people, to be specific whites.","<br />Today in the U.S, there are more black baseball players than there were in the 1800s for sure. There are African Americans playing baseball at every level of play. The number of blacks playing baseball is increasing dramatically every year.

Already a time of great turmoil and uncertainty throughout America, McCarthy’s time in Senate was especially volatile for the homosexual community as investigations and interrogations were made in an attempt to expose them. The contagion of terror regarding communist spies and traitors consuming the nation made the homosexual community a convenient target for a tandem witch-hunt, as it was believed that they were “…vulnerable to blackmail and therefore…security risk[s]” (Johnson 1994, 47). This period, known as the Lavender Scare, was rife with conflict between the Federal government and the gay community as family, friends, and colleagues began being dismissed from their jobs (Johnson 1994, 46). The Senate issued a report, “Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government”, which condemned homosexuals as morally depraved and thus “…unsuitable for employment…” (Hoey 1950, 19). It was decreed that intelligences within the work place of “sexually perverted” activities were to be investigated immediately and the person expediently and mercilessly removed from their post, regardless of years of employment.","Beyond this, Hoey’s report recommended amending the regulations on homosexual activities to make prosecution easier and penalties harsher, further constricting the gay community and thickening the shroud of fear that hovered over them (1950, 17). According to Hoey, the dismissal of purported homosexuals was justifiable in that it was in the greater interest of society to be protected from these individuals, which he viewed as deplorable (1950, 20). This was further validated by the mainstream psychiatric reasoning at the time that claimed homosexuals could be treated if “…they [had] a genuine desire to be cured” (Hoey 1950, 3).","The Lavender Scare continued to escalate as the Eisenhower administration prevented the outright employment of those convicted of sexual perversion. Homosexuals holding places in office were seen as weakening the American government and a severe “security risk” (Johnson 1994, 48). Roosevelt also came under scrutiny for “…harboring at least one homosexual…” (Johnson 1994, 50) in his office, but instead of defending them, Roosevelt also forced their resignation.","These acts of bigotry and the hostility had a tremendous effect on the self-concept of homosexuals. As Sullivan noted, homosexuals were singled out and ridiculed, while society at large turned against them. This was a tremendously demoralizing experience, because not only were they being thrown from their jobs, but forced to live in an environment of hostility and stigmatization (Sullivan 1990, 208). As a result they suffered from depression, feelings of inferiority, as well as fear, hatred, and denial of their sexuality.","The “Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government” had dramatic ramifications in the treatment of homosexuals and their perception in society. It created a chasm in society, an “us” and a “them”, with lastly and profound consequences that remain interwoven in the fabric of society today."," "],"display_date":"1945 - 1969","search_date":"1957-07-02","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":6,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":3299,"tag":"LGBT/Homosexuals/Gays"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}},{"id":6726,"title":"Arizona Senate Bill 1070: The Racial Struggle of Hispanic Americans","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"4/23/10","end_date":"6/25/12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 23, 2010, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1070 (SB 1070) also known as the “Support our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Acts” into law.  Supporters wanted security, while opponents saw a bill which enabled law enforcement to participate in legalized racial profiling. SB 1070 sought to establish an official state policy of “attrition through enforcement.”[1] The wording of the bill indicated that Arizona sought to establish an overarching carceral state in which criminality was constructed around ethnic identity. Their solution was strict enforcement by any means. Enforcement was predicated on the ability for law enforcement officers to “…without a warrant… arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe…[the person] has committed any public offense that makes [them] removable from the United States.”[2] Larry Dever, Sheriff of Cochise County Arizona, vocalized pleasure with SB 1070 and stated, “Well, we’ve been doing that down here [border enforcement] for 36 years.”[3] Sheriff Dever’s statement illustrates the participation of law enforcement in racial profiling long before SB 1070. ","In 2008 the Arizona District Court heard the case of Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, a Mexican national on vacation in the United States, in <em>Ortega Melendres, </em><em>et al. v.

Melendres was detained for over nine hours even though provided adequate identification.[4] The case decided that the MCSD had participated in a systematic practice of racial profiling. ","A long history of anti-Hispanic sentiment has been present in the politics of the United States. In 1902, Indiana senator Albert Beveridge opposed a bill which proposed statehood for multiple Southwestern territories.[5] Beveridge’s rationale was among Hispanic Americans, “…education, moral, and other elements of citizenship are unfavorable.”[6] During the Great Depression, people of Hispanic descent were blamed for many of the economic troubles which hit the Southwest. The United States responded by enacting the Immigration Act of 1929 which made entering the United State without a visa an unlawful felony.[7] The Immigration Act insinuated that people of Hispanic descent were to be associated with a degree of criminality because of the idea of unlawful entry.","Before the controversial bill was to be enacted, the United States Supreme Court found SB 1070 unconstitutional. In the <em>Opinion of the Court</em>, Justice Kennedy cited <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza</em> which established the legal precedent that it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States. SB 1070 violated this statute and established a new precedent that police can stop someone, “…based on nothing more than possible removability” which violates the previous decision of the court.[8] In a sobering statistic, roughly half of Mexican Americans have reported some form of racial discrimination throughout their life.[9] There is an undeniable thread of institutionalized discrimination against Latino Americans which has persisted throughout the twentieth century."," "," ","[1] Russell Pearce, “Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhood Act,” Pub.

At fifteen years old, she was sent there on the charge of “incorrigibility,” a status offence that sent minors to reform schools. While there, Fitzgerald, as an African American, was racially segregated into different living quarters than the white students and was “subject to physical abuse” [1].","                Despite Fitzgerald being an African American cultural icon, her story is not an uncommon one.   It was common practice to send girls with status offences and other crimes to schools meant to reform their characters.  For example, there were two different efforts for reform schools for girls of color around the time of Fitzgerald’s own incarceration: the Industrial Home School for Colored Girls, which was created in 1916 in Virginia, and a proposed Georgia school for “delinquent colored girls” that the General Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs endorsed in 1937 [2].","                In many reform schools, girls were segregated by race. Additionally, most schools featured hard labor for the sake of reforming girls’ characters [3]. For example, students at the Virginia Industrial Home School for Colored Girls performed hard labor such as farm work and hog raising for the sake of reformation. As a result, girls were only allowed to attend school half a day and then worked the farmland belonging to a member of the board of trustees, and their education consisted mainly of domestic work training [3]. Girls who were eventually paroled from the Industrial Home were forced into work with an arranged employer and the employer could return the girl at any time if the employer felt that the girl’s work proved unsatisfactory [3].","                Although these segregated reform schools no longer exist, the concept of disenfranchised education still remains. As Wald and Losen state, children who are more likely to receive inadequate education are more likely to be targeted for disciplinary actions and are therefore more likely to be discriminated against in school by getting reprimanded or punished. They continue by indicating that the groups most likely to be targeted by school disciplinary action are students of African American and Latino heritage [4]. So, students of color who are being targeted are more likely to see hindrances to their education, and this can set in motion a way for these students to be more likely targeted by prison systems for status offences.  In this way, just as Fitzgerald was considered incorrigible, students today are facing disciplinary action which can land them in prison."," ","                However, Wald and Losen state that this school-to-prison pipeline is in place because students of color are more likely targeted due to their lack of education, which has been in place since the repealing of Jim Crow laws governing school segregation [4]. And even though Fitzgerald somehow broke free from this pipeline,   the inadequate and discriminatory educational system still exists. "],"display_date":"April 13, 1933","search_date":"1933-04-13","locations":[{"id":53085,"lat":42.2528649,"lng":-73.790959,"zoom":7,"place":"Hudson, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":3359,"tag":"Incarceration"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":3404,"tag":"Ella Fitzgerald"},{"id":108,"tag":"prison"},{"id":3406,"tag":"Pipeline"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}},{"id":6875,"title":"Josephine Baker: Civil Rights Hero or a Threat to American Democracy?","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"2/3/52","end_date":"2/3/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" “Ladies and gentlemen believe me when I say that it makes me profoundly happy...it makes my heart swell with pride to see in this beautiful audience tonight, salt and pepper...I mean by that colored and white brothers mingling.”1  Josephine Baker, famed exotic dancer, gave a powerful homecoming speech to St. Louis, on February 3, 1952, stating how proud she was to see a mixed audience of “salt and pepper.” This was a landmark moment, a mixing of races in complete defiance to the Jim Crow laws. She had been invited by many civil rights groups as well as John F. Kennedy to return to join in the effort to fight discrimination and racism that was seen a normal part of American life during this time. Josephine Baker loudly voiced dreams of equality and acted against discrimination throughout her carrier, and because of this she was viewed as a radical by those opposed and “the FBI regarded Baker as a threat and a danger to America and America’s international image and reputation.” 2 Josephine was not conventional entertainer, with her opposing views to Jim Crow laws, the government saw her as a threat. The FBI was concerned with the promoting democracy and Josephine did not fit into this idea. She was accused on multiple occasions by the press of being a communist. Josephine met resistance in general public majority due to being an eccentric highly vocal black woman, but she was a hugely important figure in the fight against discrimination. "," Baker’s return to St. Louis was a powerful moment, she was returning to her hometown from which she ran away from “because of the terror of discrimination.”1 She had vowed that she “would not appear in any city where her people could not come see her.”1  Baker was met with mixed reactions from the American public. Some felt she was a hero fighting for civil rights, while others believed she was a radical trying to promote equality between races because at this time segregation was view as part of normal. Her refusal to perform in segregated venues won her support from the NAACP. Both the American Press and the African American Press, “regarded [Baker] as eccentric and risqué and as a troublemaker who often articulated threatening political views.” 3 During the 1950s, she became more politicized, speaking out against discriminatory practices and “became labeled a threat to American democracy.”2 The FBI compiled extensive files, “constructing of Baker, they sexualized, racialized and politicized her, using the media sources which had participated in deconstructing of the star by rendering a polemical profile of Baker.” 2 "," Baker, theatrical and eloquent, voiced a warning to her St. Louis audience, “try to love one another before it is too late. Don’t let the same thing happen to America through hate and misunderstanding that happened to Germany.” 1 Baker never backed down and voiced against what she knew was wrong. She lived an unapologetic life, she stated, “I have been very proud of my start, because it has made me remain human.” 1 Josephine Baker died April 1975 leaving behind a legacy of triumph and challenged the American ideals of African American women. "],"display_date":"February 3, 1952","search_date":"1952-02-03","locations":[{"id":53204,"lat":38.604731164363,"lng":-90.257197935671,"zoom":11,"place":"St. Louis, Missouri, United States."}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":225,"tag":"Jim Crow"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":3450,"tag":"josephine baker"},{"id":2860,"tag":"Equality"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":3680,"tag":"radical woman"},{"id":3681,"tag":"shero"},{"id":3682,"tag":"salt and pepper"},{"id":3683,"tag":"not nazi"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}}]}
