In 1984 Manley sat down in an interview with the goal of recording his thoughts on his career at Sloss Furnaces, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. Manley spoke of being laid off in 1967 for no stated reason but he surmised it was because the company was replacing older African Americans with younger whites. According to Manley the union did nothing about the layoffs. He contended this was because the unions were controlled by whites who were not interested in helping African Americans with grievances. In fact union officials often simply ripped up the grievances filed by African Americans. Manley directly experienced this practice; a union official by name of Carl Waddell ripped up one of Manley’s grievances right in front of a friend of Manley’s, who then told Manley.","These experiences were common for African Americans during the decades Manley worked for Sloss. Unions often had no interest in the concerns of African Americans. For example, according to historian Michael Honey, unions under the auspices of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) often organized African Americans into separate “Federal Units,” or excluded them from unions altogether. While the AFL’s rival, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), was officially more welcoming to African Americans, its white members often discriminated against them. Timothy Minchin contends the reason unions failed to support African Americans was because of local union autonomy. Local unions essentially ran themselves without interference from national organizations to which they belonged, which according to Minchin “ensured that there was often a gap between national unions’ nondiscrimination policies and actual racial practice in the south.” Local union autonomy meant that whites, who often had majority control, could do what they wanted with little opposition. Minchin contends that these local unions were allowed to pursue racist policies and actions because the national unions’ feared that if they pushed the race issue that whites would “quit their unions en masse.”","National unions’ fear of losing local influence by losing white support resulted in many sorts of discrimination of African Americans. Commonly this resulted in the union failing to do anything about how African Americans were overlooked for positions in favor of whites, mainly because these positions were seen as “White.” This is what happened to Manley; he bid on jobs and was overlooked in favor of whites. According to Manley, “The highest job a black could get before the Civil Rights Movement was when you got to be a helper or a fireman or a keeper on the furnace.” Manley’s testimony is an example of a union system that espoused racial equality but was crippled by national leaders who feared the loss of influence and local leaders with no incentive to challenge the system that assured their workplace privilege."],"display_date":1967,"search_date":"1967-07-02","locations":[{"id":31662,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5625,"title":"The Wagner Act","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"7/5/35","end_date":"7/5/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Wagner Act had great impact on industrial relations as the first part of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The National Labor Relations Act was created out of the necessity and demand for new foundations of authority and new forms of participation in the political dimension and legalization of industrial life [1]. This statement supports the idea that people are the key to industry and they must be recognized and respected.  Industry must also have clear boundaries that control the behavior of employers and employees in an industrial environment. The National Labor Relations Act consists of three statues enacted by Congress at twelve year intervals: the Wagner Act of 1935 (officially titled the National Labor Relations Act), the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 (officially the Labor-Management Relations Act), and the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959 (the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act). Since the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act were addendums to the Wagner Act it is correct to refer to the entire act as the \"National Labor Relations Act\" or the \"Labor Act.\" This analysis will focus on the Wagner Act [2].","Before the Wagner Act relations between workers and employers were combative and unsure. The \"Conspiracy Doctrine\" was created as a spurious attempt at making unions illegal by arguing that they created a hostile environment and harmed the rights of employers. Trade unions had more than 200,000 members at a time when hand crafted work was being replaced by better machines and unskilled laborers. Short lived organizations faded quickly like the Knights of Labor and National Union Labor. The American Federation of Labor had taken some critical steps in trying to create better relations but the brutality, strikes and many other tactics remained an ongoing issue.","The government began its process to change some of these issues by passing anti-trust laws such as the Sherman Anti-trust Act and the Clayton Act which contains the embodiment of the law of unlawful restraint and monopolies [3]. President Wilson created a tripartite War Labor Conference that had guiding principles of prohibiting strikes and lockouts and recognizing the rights of the workers to organize in trade unions and to bargain collectively. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took an even more innovative approach with the National Recovery Industrial Act which was designed to get people back to work during the Great Depression. Section 7 (a) was key  to the Wagner Act because it expressed the right of workers to join unions and collective bargain which relaxed the anti-trust laws.","The Wagner Act is organized into subsections entitled: Findings and Policy, National Labor Relations Board, Representatives and Elections, Rights of Employees, Prevention of Unfair Labor Practices and Investigative Powers. The subsection \"Finding and Policy\" clearly promotes commerce and the flow of commerce as in protecting commerce from any harm caused by poor labor relations or unfair labor practices. This section also identifies the need for quality bargaining and encourages the adjudication of friendly disputes. This section also defines terms such as commerce, labor organization, employee and so on [4].","The remaining subsections address the National Labor Relations Board and how it is set up including how many members, how long they serve on the board, salary, appointment and reappointment and hierarchy of the board. The sections and subsections also focus on things employers cannot do such as interfere, discriminating against, restraining, coercing employees or refuse to bargain collectively with employees.","Historian James McGregor Burns said,\" the Wagner Act was the most radical legislation passed during the New Deal, in the sense that it altered the nations politics by vesting massive economic power in organized labor\" [5]. The major polices of the Wagner Act are unfair labor practices, representation elections and related policies. The Wagner Act contains many broad passages but the heart of the message is for the rights of the employee.","The Slogan, \"Let Collective Bargaining Become an Instrument of industrial Peace,\" is a message that supports the idea that the Wagner Act is a revolutionary way of thinking that is not concerned with the legal status but the area of unfair labor practices. The functionality of the Wagner Act is to create conditions for bargaining and formalized agreement [6]. These labor relations have been as important to many in our history as emancipation was to the slave community because it addresses the exploitation of the worker. The labor legislation during the time of the New Deal was revolutionary and it opened doors for a better foundation for labor relations that became a turning point in industrial life as it set new standards for communication and expectations for industrial work. These expectations include (1) drastically limiting the power of the employer to oppose union membership by propaganda, intimidation or discrimination of union members; (2) established machinery for selection by employees of union leaders of their own choosing; (3) proclaimed collective bargaining the preferred road to industrial peace [7]."," ","[1] Philip Selznick<em>, </em><em>Law, Society, and Industrial Justice,</em> 1969, 137-140.","[2] Frank W.

Knudsen (Ford Motor Company, and GMC) and Sidney Hillman (head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America), Roosevelt expressed his opinion on the matter rather flatly.  “ [The] discrimination against Negro workers has been nation-wide…[they] are being turned from the gates of industry on specifications entirely unrelated to efficiency and productivity…this situation is a matter of grave national importance, and immediate steps must be taken to deal with it effectively.”  Roosevelt goes on to state that “Every available source of labor capable of production defense materials must be tapped in the present emergency.”  He saw the discrimination for what it is: an uneducated and backwards, racist sentiment left over from the previous century.  He urged unions and labor leaders like Knudsen and Hillman to take into account the huge numbers of skilled black workers to increase war-time productivity.","Of course, this did not guarantee success, nor did his Roosevelt’s words fall only on discerning ears.  Many times the policies of different workplaces caused racial tension and strikes throughout the country.  In Mobile, Alabama, one of the South’s biggest shipyards and transportation hubs, more than a few strikes crippled production.  For instance, the Mobile Pulley Works was halted in August of 1942 over racial discrimination.  Eighty percent of the workers of the Mobile Pulley Works were black laborers.  During August, several black workers were discharged from work for varying small incidents.  The main incident in question was that of the Financial Secretary of the local “colored” union was fired.  The unnamed Fin. Sec. was off work for three days following a death in his immediate family, and upon returning to work he was told that he must leave, and would not receive his job returned.  This ended up putting his family on the street within days of loosing said position.  The day he was fired, the story circulated throughout the Works and caused an uproar that ended up with all the black workers leaving work to strike at the gates.  In effect, the lack of workers caused much strife in the production of war materials.  The Mobile Pulley Works created pulleys, winches for Jeeps, gears for war machinery, but also produced a number of artillery pieces and artillery rounds themselves…so it is easily seen just how needed their business was during WW2.  In the end, the Work’s unions were able to settle with the business and put its men back to work for the war effort…of course, this strike would likely never had happened if Roosevelt’s policies were actually observed without question.","Many laws and policies have been challenged in the course of the United States’ existence.  From slavery, education, and work, all the way up to social issues and tearing down barriers with the outside world.  It is quite disconcerting to know that a man so responsible for this nation’s continued being was heard and not observed. Of course, such is the way of social, political, and racial advancement in the world today; we must take strides to make better the future for others."],"display_date":"1940 - 1945","search_date":"1942-12-31","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":25291,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1684,"tag":"Unions"},{"id":1683,"tag":"Black Workers"},{"id":1682,"tag":"Roosevelt"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

First, Lithuanian “cutters” employed by wholesalers of fabric worked in warehouses to form the parts of coats—the sleeves, the collars, and so on. Next, these parts were moved to the sweatshops that teemed in the neighborhood bounded by Fayette Street and Eastern Avenue on the north and south, and Central Avenue and Broadway on the east and west.. There, men operating sewing machines assembled the parts into coats. Finally, women working by hand finished the coats. The owners of these sweatshops, like almost all the sewing machine operators and seamstresses, were Jews from Poland.","Since 1886, the men working the sewing machines and the women finishing the coats had each had their own union, first as part of Terence Powderly’s Knights of Labor, and then beginning in 1891 in the United Garment Workers, affiliated with Samuel Gompers’ American Federation of Labor. In these early days of American labor, disputes among unions were frequent, and the AFL had split off from the Knights only a few years prior in a major schism. And while the Jewish seamstresses and sewing machine operators had switched to the AFL, the Lithuanian cutters remained Knights. Soon after joining up with the AFL (which was far more strident than the Knights), the members of Baltimore’s UGW locals began to circulate their demands. They wanted a ten-hour workday instead of twelve to eighteen. They wanted to be paid every week, instead of whenever their bosses got paid for finished coats. They wanted year-long contracts, instead of ad-hoc employment. And they wanted everyone working in the shops to be a member of the UGW, with a UGW representative coming by regularly to ensure that workplace conditions were suitable.","The employees of the shops discovered that the owners were going to complete their current orders and then lock the union members out. So the UGW (with the assistance of national secretary Henry Reichers) preemptively went on strike on June 30. Approximately one thousand tailors and seamstresses shut down over thirty sweatshops. Within a week, a third of the “sweaters,” as the shop owners were known, had given in and agreed to operate their shops on union terms. In fact, the strike may have been too successful. Days later, the sweaters formed their own union, the Monumental Tailors’ Benevolent Association. The MTBA was advised by (though not yet aligned with) the Knights of Labor, who were staunch competitors against the AFL. The Knights, who were already affiliated with the Lithuanian cutters, pressured the sweaters not to give in to the demands of the Polish Jewish tailors and seamstresses. Now, instead of each sweatshop owner dealing with the union on his own, the Association was dealing with the UGW. The MTBA tried to convince the male tailors, who led the UGW negotiators, to abandon the female seamstresses, but were rebuffed by a strong show of solidarity. Despite this new stumbling block, the UGW and MTBA hammered out the framework of an agreement by early August. Only one problem remained.","The MTBA, on the advice of local Knights leader J. G. Schonfarber, insisted that the restriction of employees to membership in the UGW be changed to membership in any labor organization, including the Knights of Labor. The UGW, frustrated by the turn negotiations had taken, decided that they would go back to dealing with individual employers, which had worked so well just a month earlier. The MTBA responded by formally joining the Knights of Labor as the Monumental Coat Contractors’ Association. It now became clear to most of the seamstresses, tailors, and sweaters (who themselves were not wealthy or powerful men) that their local dispute had been hijacked by the rivalry between two major national unions. They had been better off before the Knights of Labor ever intervened. By October, almost all the striking workers had returned to the shops. The sweaters employed them on the union’s terms, even without a formal agreement between the union and the shops. The strike had ended when the owners decided to come to terms with their fellow Polish Jews rather than maintain the interests of the Lithuanian cutters or participate in the squabble between the AFL and the Knights of Labor."],"display_date":"June 1, 1892 - October 30, 1892","search_date":"1892-08-15","locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":156,"tag":"Labor Strike"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1664,"tag":"Jewish"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}}]}
