As made official through the Volstead Act and The Eighteenth Amendment, “The manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.” [1] Americans in the South and Midwest, as well as the Ku Klux Klan, and the Women’s Christian Temperance Union had gained Congressional support in ratifying the legislation resulting in the ban of alcoholic beverages in order to hope to improve the behavior, purity of Americans, as well as improving their work ethic. However, this wholesomeness was not achieved as the rise of crime, gangs, smuggling, and more alcoholism among the youth were introduced and flourished in America, especially urban areas.","                When Prohibition was introduced in the Roaring Twenties, America was already experiencing a cultural shift supported by the Progressives and the overall revolutionary ideas Americans were being introduced to. This supports the idea that Prohibition was a social experiment which was not carefully thought out. America had made an early attempt at controlling national alcoholism by trying to limit alcohol sales on individuals including the amount purchased, the distributor, and the frequency of consumption. However, it is significant to note that under the control of Neal Dow, Maine became the first state to introduce temperance and before Congress’ official ban on alcohol thirty-three of the forty- eight states already had prohibition laws. The United States’ national action regarding alcohol was seen as a global example, as noted by Earnest H. Cherrington, the General Secretary of the World League Against Alcoholism in this book <em>American Prohibition</em>, “If American Prohibition should fail, such failure would undoubtedly tend to discourage the anti-alcoholic forces in other parts of the world and to delay the final solution of the world-wide problem.” [2]","                As Cherrington noted, alcoholism and the social experiment of Prohibition not only affected Americans, but had a global impact as well. Upon prohibiting the sale of alcohol in America, those who were still wishing to consume alcohol turned to foreign markets for their supply. As stated by New York congressmen, Fiorello La Guardia, this had a large impact on economics and finances in America at the time, “At least $1,000,000,000 a year is lost to the National Government and the several states and counties in excise taxes.”[3] Because Americans were obtaining their alcohol from foreign or illegal sources, such as bootleggers, there was a great loss in revenue during a time when America could definitely use any financial help.","                These shady means of obtaining alcohol were a direct negative consequence of Prohibition as Americans saw the rise of organized crime, developed an underground culture with places such as speakeasies, and were introduced to a new lawlessness and irresponsibility unseen before the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. As a visitor to America in 1920, Count Felix von Luckner observed this saying, “A large part of the population has become accustomed to disregard and violate the law without thinking. My observations have convinced me that many fewer would drink were it not illegal.”[4] David Kyvig, a modern day historian, drew from accounts such as Count Felix von Luckner’s to understand the development of the new industry, “The behavior of those who sought to profit by meeting the demand for alcoholic beverages created an indelible image of lawlessness. National prohibition provided a potentially very profitable opportunity for persons willing to take certain risks.”[5] As noted many Americans were disobeying the law because enforcement was so weak and often took part in corruption and indulgence themselves.","                Prohibition, which is either viewed as a Noble Cause or a Social Experiment had both domestic and global impacts and was known for its radical impacts and consequences. In an attempt to control American’s wild drunkenness, Prohibition actually worsened the situation as more crime, lawlessness, and misbehaving occurred.  The failures of Prohibition were both nationally and globally recognized and eventually the ban was repealed by the Twenty-First Amendment."," "," ","[1] <em>The 18<sup>th</sup> Amendment.</em> 30 November 2009 http://www.albany.edu/~wm731882/18th_amendment_final.html"," ","[2]Cherrington, Earnest H. <em>American Prohibition. </em>Westerville, Ohio: World League Against Alcoholism, 1926.","[3] Fiorello La Guardia. <em>Prohibition. </em>1926","[4] Count von Luckner, Felix. <em>Seeteufel erobert Amerika; </em>in Handlin, Oscar<em>.

These ideas were continually supported throughout time by important figures such as Abraham Lincoln. In the 1840s, the \"dry movement\" was lead by zealous religious denominations, especially the Methodists. During the Second Great Awakening, there was an extreme shift of moral attitudes and a push for social reform. The \"hearty, carefree drinking habits of the yeoman-artisan republic\" had eroded so much that public drunkeness became standard and soon associated with human depression, social disorder, and violence.","The Boston Temperance Alliance stated in their 1861 address to the commonwealth that for \"a third of a century, the duty of abandoning the use, and prohibiting the sale, of intoxicating liquors as a beverage has been gaining the assent and commanding the approval of the virtuous of every class.\" The Alliance went on to attacked certain areas of the nation, one in particular being the \"liquor-demented Washington... the deluged-precincts of the capital.\" The truth was; however, that alcohol had always been the focal point of social and political events. Churches were purposefully built next to taverns for congregation after services and alcohol was even seen as a cure for certain illnesses. People who did not attribute the political and social corruption to alcohol, hastily organized opposition to temperance. These members of society founded their own organizations and triggered outbreaks of violence such as the Lager Beer Riot in 1855 after the Know-Nothing mayor of Chicago closed bars on Sunday.","The idea that “respectable men go to church on Sunday” stood; however, and the American Temperance Society brought the movement to a national scale. In the 1890s, the Anti-Saloon League of America became a leading force and sought not only moderation, but complete prohibition. In 1915, a statue known as the Maine Law outlawed sale in alcohol in Portland and consequently, many northern states followed their lead. The Massachusetts Temperance Alliance address stated that the \"progress of every moral enterprise, in order to be stable, must be slow... prohibitory policy has risen from the position of being vascilatingly tolerated in one or two of the states, to that of stable authority in many of them, and even to a recognition by Congress itself.\" The 18th Amendment was eventually put into effect on January 16, 1920. Through the Volstead Act, prohibition was enforced.","Issues of social degradation were the catalyst for the “dry” movement beginning in the mid-1800s. Prohibition; however, became increasingly unpopular, especially in the big cities and on March 23, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt singed the Cullen-Harrison Act which allowed the manufacture and sale of \"3.2 beer\" and light wines. Surrounding the issue of prohibition during the early 1900s was a sense of inevitability. With such a widespread effort against alcohol, the 18th Amendment was predictable. Blue Laws are currently still in effect for many states in the nation and issues surrounding alcohol have permeated into literature and other forms of entertainment. Although prohibition did not stick, alcohol consumption is still a predominant issue socially and politically; the concentration being moderation once again."],"display_date":"January 30, 1900","search_date":"1900-01-30","locations":[{"id":49725,"lat":42.6001926046,"lng":-73.9735779487,"zoom":9,"place":"Albany, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5144,"title":"Principle of Prohibition","course_id":52,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/00","end_date":"12/31/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["          The “Principle of Prohibition” by Doctor Ernest H. Cherrington was an educational pamphlet written in the early 1900’s. Dr. Cherrington questions the principles of prohibition. He was a general secretary with the World League against Alcohol; he raises questions about people who question prohibition. He doesn’t understand why the people who are against prohibition still wanted regulation in other systems. He wrote the article to point out and raise interesting questions related to the rules of alcohol. He questioned the laws concerning the age of legal alcohol consumption the amount and even questioned why it’s ok to sell it at 9:15 but not at 9:30. Dr Cherrington was clearly against alcohol and likely wrote this article because of the popularity and abuse of alcohol at that time was running high. He felt that alcohol was an important issue to address.","            Prohibition was the practice of prohibiting the transportation, sales, manufacturing, importing and exporting alcohol. In 1919 the United States passed the national prohibition act and the battle began between the “dry & wet”, meaning alcohol or no alcohol. The battle between these two groups had been going on since the 19<sup>th</sup> Century.  Alcohol played a major role and was a huge part in American history. Going back into history even the immigrants and settlers made their own liquor that included beer and wine. Even when the immigrants came to America they traveled and bought alcohol into the United States. Alcohol became a huge part in American society and contributed to the economy a great deal. Farmers were happy because they profited by making and selling alcohol from the barley they grew. It became a favorite hobby for some people and considered alcohol as a favorite pastime. Alcohol caused good and bad during the progressive era (1890-1920), it helped the economy on the good side and caused hostility on the bad side. There were many people against alcohol hence all the supporters of prohibition. Alcohol caused hostility in saloons and shops opened up crime in the black market and effected people’s health. On the other side of the coin alcohol contributed to fun times for people, a hobby to relax and let off steam from a hard days work or just meeting up with friends.  ","Christian evangelicals in 1910 were among the groups who were against alcohol. They took action in there own ways during their quest for prohibition. Because there were so many against and felt strong about the effects of alcohol they joined forces and used various types of propaganda against alcohol. There were songs, poems, pamphlets, and posters trying to prove to the public that alcohol is harmful. One of the most influential propagandas from the evangelicals was the posters because they presented a clear visual message that had gotten across the public. Even though they tried so hard to get their messages across their information did not influence the public as they thought. The public enjoyed alcohol and chose to ignore the messages. Just proves that the truth at the time wasn’t a concern to the public when it came to the physical and mental effects alcohol could cause in a person.","            People in the United States questioned and opposed prohibition in many ways. Dr. Cherrington raised good points. If you are against prohibition then why make rules such as limitations of how much alcohol can be purchased at once or how old is the right age to drink. Dr. Cherrington feels that the rules made in regards to alcohol were made without putting much thought into it. He feels that prohibition is the answer and adding laws to alcohol will not change the way alcohol is consumed"],"display_date":"1900 - 1919","search_date":"1909-12-31","locations":[{"id":52373,"lat":46.2975453728,"lng":-117.907874423,"zoom":9,"place":"Columbia, Washington"},{"id":50175,"lat":39.4276655911,"lng":-84.1668444718,"zoom":10,"place":"Warren, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5465,"title":"Potential Danger for Prohibition","course_id":84,"status":"P","start_date":"1/31/20","end_date":"1/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1920 Linton Smith, also known as the Bishop of Hereford, wrote a controversial article on the Temperance Movement and Prohibition. Linton claimed that prohibition could possibly divide political parties on a, “Sex basis,\" meaning that female prohibition proponents could vote as a block against male opponents of prohibition.<br /> <br /> Strong drink was very popular in the lives of men during the time. In this time men were turning to alcohol because of work conditions, social, and sanitary reasons. In most cases this would affect the home life and relationship between husband and wife.  Because of the large amounts consumed men would become violent with their wives or spend all their income on alcohol rather than providing things needed for their family. Tension was rising between both men and women because of alcohol.<br /> <br />During the mid 1800’s to the early 1900’s women played a dominant role in the Temperance Movement and Prohibition. By 1892 the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, the largest temperance union at the time, had nearly 150,000 members. Historian Ruth Bordin writes that, “Through the WCTU, women became visible as leaders in communities and cities from coast to coast” (Bordin 157). Not only was the WCTU the largest temperance movement, but also the largest women’s organization in America. Because of the growing number of followers, the union began to respond not only to temperance but larger issues they were facing, such as women’s suffrage. Bordin also writes, “Through the Union women learned of their legal and social disabilities, gained confidence in their strengths and talents, and became certain of their political power as a group and as individuals” (Bordin 157). The Union allowed for women to push the envelope and fight for their rights, one of those rights being the right to vote. This right was given to women in 1920 with the passing of the 19th Amendment.<br /> <br />It is for reasons like this that Smith wrote the article on the danger of Prohibition and the Temperance Movement. Women were already aligned, in large numbers, with the WCTU and would vote for Prohibition. Smith felt as though the passing of this law would cause tension between the two sexes and split the political parties based on this one idea. He writes that, “The law will certainly be passed, if it is passed at all, by women for men, and it will be resented the more for that reason”."],"display_date":"January 31, 1920","search_date":"1920-01-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":644,"tag":"woman's suffrage"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5608,"title":"\"Bill and the Water Wagon\"","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the Second Industrial Revolution in the United States, the consumption of alcohol became very popular, especially by men before and after work.  In thirty years, from 1870 to 1900, the number of bars in the nation grew from 30,000 to 100,000.  Since the late 19th century, years before Prohibition went into effect, moral reformers saw alcohol consumption as a problem and pushed constantly for Prohibition laws to be passed at the local, state, and federal levels.  Finally, in 1920 a Prohibition law (the 18th Amendment) passed Congress making the manufacture, transportation, and the sale of liquor illegal.  There were many people that were against Prohibition because people enjoyed their time at the bar and many men enjoyed their few glasses of alcohol daily.  One group of people that did support Prohibition was factory owners.  Factory owners supported Prohibition because they thought it would increase how effective their workers were and help them prevent factory related accidents and injuries.[1]  In addition to factory owners being in favor of Prohibition, many women were also in favor of Prohibition mainly because alcohol consumption often encourages men to talk in a derogatory way to their families, beat their wives, and spend money unnecessarily.[2]"," ","Bar owners were definitely against Prohibition because that is how they earned their money and made a living.  Since many men went to the bar several times a day throughout the week they spent a nice part of their hard earned money on alcohol, but since many blue-collar workers earned low wages, this could impact a family financially over the years without being noticed.  Bar owners made a decent living, while the working class man could not move forward in life financially.  Bar owners purchased nice clothing, jewelry, and could even afford an automobile while the men at the bar could not give their family nice clothes."," ","In a 1914 article “Bill and the Water Wagon,” Bill is asked if he is “wet” or “dry,” meaning if he would vote for or against Prohibition.  He replies that he is “wet.”  When Bill sees a sign advertising Budweiser with a slogan “Budweiser is a good friend of mine,” he starts to think about whether Budweiser really had been his friend?  After thinking for a while, Bill realizes that neither Budweiser nor any other type of alcohol is his friend.  Bill concludes that by going to the bar for a couple drinks before work in the morning, going in the afternoon for one or two more, and then going in the evening to have anywhere from one to three drinks he gives a lot of his money away to the bar owner.  Bill calculates that he has spent $1,859.22 in ten years at his local bar.  He spent this money making the bar owner rich while his wife and children did not have anything nice to wear or a nice home to live in.  Bill realizes he can put his money to better use by caring for his family rather than supporting the bar owner and his wife.  Bill begins to think that maybe Prohibition isn’t such a bad thing. [3]"," ","“Bill and the Water Wagon” was published in 1914 to show people in the United States the downside to alcohol consumption and promote Prohibition to those who were on the fence about banning alcohol.  The author of this article, M.H.P., wanted to show readers the negative side to alcohol consumption and the financial benefit of being on the “water wagon.”  Being on the water wagon symbolizes people drinking water rather than drinking alcohol.  This article really shows readers the benefits of Prohibition and how much their families could benefit from it they voted “dry.”  Readers would have had to consider the amount of money they were spending on alcohol and possibly rethink their priorities in life."," ","Though the 18th Amendment banning alcohol production and sales was overturned by the 21st Amendment in 1933, a short thirteen years after it was passed by Congress, it did seem that Prohibition held the potential to better the lives of many people.  While rich people did not have to worry about watching their dollars, working-class people like Bill did, and, for moral reformers, keeping people away from alcohol seemed like a way to help keep everyone out of trouble.  Ultimately, President Franklin Roosevelt, who won the election in 1932, opposed Prohibition, because he felt taxing alcohol production would help raise money for the government and he also saw alcohol production as a way to help the American economy get back on its feet and to put people back to work during the Great Depression.  Ultimately alcohol could be a good thing for the United States economy, but if not used in moderation by each individual man it could ruin his finances and his relationship with his family."," ","[1] “Prohibition”","[2] “A Look at Prohibition, Hardly Dry”","[3] “BILL, and the Water Wagon”"],"display_date":"1920 - 1932","search_date":"1926-07-02","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1563,"tag":"18th Amendment"},{"id":1564,"tag":"Bill and the Water Wagon"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5624,"title":"Prohibition and the Whiskey Rebellion","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1/16/20","end_date":"1/16/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 13, 1927, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article entitled “Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791: Arguments Used in the Whisky Rebellion Crisis Are Like Today’s,” which sought to highlight similarities between the 1790s Whiskey Rebellion and the events of Prohibition in the 1920s. Much like the events of the Whiskey Rebellion, the period of Prohibition caused citizens to actively protest the new law, disregard the authority of enforcement officers, and become concerned about the legitimacy of the newly enacted law. Prohibition was enacted on January 16, 1920, following the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America [1]. Prohibition defined the manufacturing, sale, and transportation of alcohol to be illegal. This significant change in national law came about at the beginning of the “Roaring Twenties,” further complicating the Americans’ already challenging lives. The government’s efforts to ban manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcohol nationwide caused an enormous number of Americans to take part in the illegal smuggling and transport of the product.","The Whiskey Rebellion came about in 1791 following a proposal made to Congress by Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, in which he requested that whiskey be taxed by the United States government [2]. This law was proposed to help pay down the national debt, which the government owed to bondholders, as well as to decrease excess consumption of alcohol by Americans [3]. Whiskey in the 1790s, much like alcohol in general in the 1920s, was used as a means for relaxing and celebrating overcoming the difficulties of life. The taxation of whiskey caused opponents to question the intentions of the U.S. government, and oppose enforcement of the tax. Americans had recently fought the American Revolution, in part due to taxes imposed by Great Britain, and were now questioning why it was required that the tax on whiskey be honored[4]. As with Prohibition, concern of the new amendment’s legality led to great disregard of the authority of Congress in regions such as western Pennsylvania, where much of the whiskey was produced.","Enforcement of the tax was comparable to that of the enforcement of Prohibition.  Enforcement officers were deployed to help ensure that the tax was being honored, and that Americans were not refusing to pay.  The <em>New York Times</em> article from 1927 argued that the task of both the collectors of 1791 and the enforcement agents of 1920 were “equally dangerous and unprofitable” [5]. Both enforcement services were vastly disregard by citizens, and in some cases mistreated.  Despite the official title as “law enforcement” officers, Prohibition agents and other public officials often took part in the movement and use of alcohol during the course of prohibition, while tax collectors during the Whiskey Rebellion were sometimes tarred and feathered [6].","Both laws encouraged large numbers of Americans to disregard and violate them [7]. Publications produced during the time of Prohibition claimed that the popular response to Prohibition in the 1920s was similar to some Americans behavior in the 1790s, that the congressmen had “consulted dusty files” to support their theory [8]. The impact that the Eighteenth Amendment had on the United States can be seen as extremely devastating. As with many laws, supporters were faced with violators and resistance groups. Establishments such as “speakeasies” were underground drinking locations where citizens and even some public officials during the Prohibition Era would congregate to relax and enjoy alcoholic beverages.  The underground drinking establishments were being supplied by multiple illegal transporting groups, causing alcohol to be illegally imported across the border from neighboring countries such as Canada [9]. Public officials were often in attendance, presenting a degree of corruption in the law’s enforcement.","The tax on whiskey was eventually in repealed after 1800, following years of resistance by the American people.  Prohibition, following a similar route, was ultimately ended through the result of the 1933 ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment, which both repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and placed alcohol laws in the hands of the states [10]."," ","[1] “Prohibition in the United States,” <em>1920-30.com </em>http://www.1920-30.com/prohibition/ (accessed 24 Oct. 2012)","[2] “Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania: The Whiskey Rebellion,” <em>Papers of the War Department</em> http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=285 (accessed 24 Oct. 2012)","[3] <em>New York Times, </em>“Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791: Arguments Used in the “Whisky Rebellion Crisis Are Like Today’s,” 13 Feb. 1927, pg. 5","[4] “Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania: The Whiskey Rebellion”","[5] “Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791\"","[6] <em>Ibid</em>.","[7] <em>Ibid</em>.","[8] <em>Ibid</em>.","[9] “Prohibition in the United States”","[10] <em>Ibid</em>."],"display_date":"January 16, 1920","search_date":"1920-01-16","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1587,"tag":"Whiskey Rebellion"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5686,"title":"An Alabama Minister Fights for Temperance By Using Race","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/00","end_date":"1/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the early decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the Alabama Anti-Saloon League published a brief flyer outlining the group’s proposals.

Cleveland wrote about his opinion on state-wide legislation but claimed to only “discuss politics… when it intruded on moral issues.” Historian Wayne Flynt depicts Cleveland as concerned about the creation of “a national or statewide prohibition law as well as creation of a ‘political temperance party… [because] he feared that such politicization would split whites, undermine the Democratic Party, and harm the cause of temperance.” Flynt goes on to suggest that “Cleveland urged individual Christians to spurn liquor, and he urged prohibition leaders to marshal their energy for local option elections,” which would allow the white community to control county-wide legislation without creating controversy among whites. Local option was the best option in the view of many Alabama Baptist ministers because not everyone within the white community agreed with temperance. This would cause friction within the white community because there was an fraction of whites would did not want temperance interfering in their own lives. This faction was dealt with through local option which required a popular vote and, like typical Americans, we accept majority vote as the official say on any matter. This means that local option avoided any friction within the white community because of its majority vote. The National Temperance Almanac states that Local option allowed for a licensing system in which “local, municipal and county authorities” could give liquor licenses “to all applicants of good character.” The requirement of “good character” allowed local governments to control which communities would be allowed liquor licenses.","Local option and the licensing system ended up being a control mechanism used by middle and upper-class whites to once again to reestablish control over the African-American community after reconstruction.  Middle and upper-class whites achieved this though selective licensing when the county was voted ‘wet’. Historian Wayne Flynt describes Crumpton as having “combined racial politics with prohibition, describing whiskey bottles ‘sold only to the brutish negroes’ and that ‘contained pictures of nude white women’.” Crumpton viewed the local option and licensing system as a means to control the African-American community while allowing white superiority to vote their own destiny. The permanent and perpetual Anti-Saloon force, according to Crumpton is pressing for Civil Righteousness, was actually pressing to disenfranchise the African-American communities through local option and the licensing system. "],"display_date":"January 1, 1900 - January 1, 1919","search_date":"1909-07-02","locations":[{"id":50982,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5687,"title":"African-American Pastors Develop the ‘Black Temperance Movement’","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"8/14/10","end_date":"8/14/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A flyer stating “Colored Citizens Mass Meeting” describes the movement of African-American pastors to change the view of the “Negro Race.”. The flyer describes the place and time that congregations would meet and the objectives of the meeting. The meeting was called in an attempt to “protest against colored women visiting barrooms and barroom premises [and] also against children visiting such places, for whisky and beer.” The pastors also called for a protest in favor of temperance within the African-American communities because alcohol was viewed as “[an] evil... [that is] most disgraceful to the Negro race.”","Although, as the flyer suggests, African-American pastors were concerned about African-American welfare and pro-temperance historian Lee Willis claims that “black churches remained reluctant to endorse temperance whole-heartedly.” This reluctance of the African-American community was due to the racial undertones of the temperance movement within the white community. Historian Wayne Flynt examines how Alabama Baptist ministers harnessed racism within Alabama as a catalyst for the Temperance movement. Flynt states that “Crumpton combined racial politics with prohibition, describing whiskey bottles ‘sold only to the brutish negroes’ that contained pictures of nude white women.” The racist rhetoric used by Crumpton and other white temperance leaders is the cause behind the ambivalence of African-American pastors and community leaders to join the movement.","Despite the reluctance of many African-American leaders to join the cause of the white temperance movement the African-American community would begin to establish their own independent movement. This allowed the African-American community to ride the wave of temperance all the while having distanced themselves from white attempts to regain control of their community. African-American pastors would establish their own movement in an attempt to create a “stepping stone to a greater civil and political advancement.” Although white communities had their own agendas; Historian Donald Yacovone explains that African-American communities made efforts to “adopt temperance principles [in order to] gain white respect.” Many African-American leaders hoped to curb the prejudice views of the white community through temperance.  ","This flyer exemplifies the African-American community’s reaction to the Temperance movement and the attempt of African-American pastors to create, as described by Yacovone, a “moral reform [that] would cause slavery, prejudice, and intemperance to disappear.” The call for “protest [against] the evils [that are] most disgraceful to the Negro race” show an attempt for the African-American community to move forward in order to control their own communities through reform and progressive acts without allowing the white community to once again control their daily lives."],"display_date":"August 14, 1910","search_date":"1910-08-14","locations":[{"id":18257,"lat":33.553801834,"lng":-86.8960886107,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5788,"title":"\"What!

Rob A Poor man of his Beer!\" and the meaning behind the words contained within that were written by \"Mr. John Barleycorn Jr.\". The name of the author appears to be a fictitcious name that was used by the anonymous writer of the pamphlet to personify alcohol and to better get his point across. The article was published for the use of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union.","Organizations such as the Women's National Christian Temperance Union were key players in the fight for national Prohibition of alcohol and utilized documents such as \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" to get their message across to readers. The exact date of the pamphlets publication is not noted in the document, but it was created by the National Temperance Society and Publication House in New York sometime between December 24th 1873 when the first protest by the Temperance group occurred to prior to the January 16th, 1920, adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment which prohibited the sale and distribution of alcohol.","The document is a poem that describes the possible pitfalls of alcohol consumption and attempts to focus on the important negative aspects of the consequences of its use such as the financial strain, domestic violence, and immoral behavior that its abuse promotes. It is obvious that the document is a pro-Prohibition document that was designed to enlighten the reader and was used as a tool by the Christian Temperance Union to gain support for a nationwide ban on alcohol production.","The pamphlet points out how much money is wasted on alcohol consumption that could be used to improve the lives of the families that it affects. It places a great deal of emphasis upon how funds are wasted in the saloons that could be better the economic situations for many families. This was a definite concern during those times.","As stated in the poem \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" there is mention of a few examples of the type of financial issues that alcoholic abuse contributed to. One such example was mentioned in this statement \"Of ten thousand dollars paid upon the spot, two-thirds was paid directly to the saloons.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This statement alone proves that alcoholism was a major cause for economic problems that were hurting the economy of families across the nation. Violence is also hinted towards in the pamphlet.","There are several lines in the poem which point out alcohol as being the reason for violence in the family. One such line states \"What! Rob a Poor man of his ale, and prevent him from beating his wife.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This one line speaks of how violence in the family directed towards women was a serious issue and a justification for Prohibition to be ratified. It is clear from such statements that the author wanted to alert readers that domestic abuse occurred when intoxicated husbands returned home from a night out at the saloon.","Overall the document is a perfect example of how organizations got their message across in regard to their views on Prohibition during an era when print media was the only way to spread information and influence public opinion. The pamphlet's author utilized a poem to explain the downfalls of alcoholism and more importantly promoted and drew attention to the benefits of a dry nation. It was also a way to deliver a message to the general population in a language that everyone could understand at that time. This is clear in the simplistic, informative, but also somewhat entertaining, way that the author attempts to get the attention of the reader by his or her use of a poetic form of writing."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 24, 1873","search_date":"1873-12-24","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1840,"tag":"Womens Temperance"},{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5798,"title":"A review of an article debating whether Prohibition was a success or failure.","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"1/17/20","end_date":"12/5/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Prohibition was a time in American history when some Americans’ desire to improve the lives of people in the United States by removing the temptation of alcohol (or ‘Prohibiting’ it) overshadowed the intrinsic rights and freedoms that are so dear to our country. Prohibition refers to “any law banning the sale and consumption of alcohol, in particular local laws that have the same effect.” [1] Prohibition was enacted from 1920-1933 because it was felt that alcohol was at the root of most crimes committed.  The logic of the laws was that by banning alcohol, society would see the near elimination of almost all acts of crime.  The proponents of these laws were mainly religious and women’s groups.","While crime declined by approximately a third initially [2], these laws actually lead to a new crop of illegal activity resulting in thousands of deaths from either murders, contamination from the consumption of unregulated alcohol, or violence against people who tried to obtain alcohol.","“ Prohibition – A Success or Failure” is a six-page article written in May of 1926 by the American Issue Publishing Company in Westerville, Ohio.  The author was Wayne B. Wheeler, General Counsel and Legislative Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of America.  His status within the Anti-Saloon league would indicate that he had a bias against the sale and consumption of alcohol and was a supporter of Prohibition.  However his views in the article seem fairly unbiased.  The article takes a look at Prohibition to see if the act helped eliminate the problems to which alcohol contributes or only proved as a social experiment that crime will continue to exist even without the presence of booze.","The article touches on the devastating effects of eliminating an entire industry.  This law not only affected brewers and saloon owners, but delivery men, cleaning crews, prison guards, and all the people who benefitted from this industry, including their families.  Typically, when an industry meets its end, it is in a gradual manner, brought about by gradually decreasing sales, etc.  So the impact of essentially “laying off” this entire industry at the same time was severe.","However, the benefits to drinkers, their personal health, family life, and public life were undeniable.  Family life saw a drastic improvement as paychecks were put to better use and life expectancies, and therefore wage earning years, lengthened.","During its relatively short 13-year lifespan, national Prohibition did a great deal of good for long-term family life.  It is significantly difficult to break familial cycles.  People repeat the habits that they grew up with unless they put significant effort into consciously changing them.  Therefore, there was a whole generation of kids who would have otherwise been raised in households with drunken fathers.  Mathematically, those children went on to have one to any number of children for whom the cycle was broken.  That changed the future for an innumerable number of Americans.  Success or failure, it may have been enough to reshape the future of American society."],"display_date":"January 17, 1920 -

A. Nupatree documented his travels through the state of Georgia. Nupatree documented his travels through the larger as well as the smaller cites because he wanted to study prohibition throughout the state. In his paper Nupatree claimed to be indifferent on the subject of prohibition, saying he observed everything with an impartial eye. However, Nupatree did go on to say, “I was rather prejudiced against prohibition as the best method, especially for the larger cities.” This showed he had somewhat of a bias to the subject matter. Nupatree also believed that statistics should have been ignored because they could easily be manipulated and were often unreliable for people.","Nupatree noticed that he saw only seven men under the influence of intoxicants throughout his entire trip. He stated that anyone could see that number of intoxicated men in a few minutes in the state of New Jersey. Nupatree found himself surprised by the how much drunkenness he had actually encountered in Georgia's cities. Most cities in other states shrugged off prohibition and did not pay it any attention.","Nupatree did notice that a lot of “near beer” was sold in the larger cites of the state. He said that hard liquor was hard to come by except for inside clubs, where even then its use was mostly restricted to those who would not abuse the substance. Because of all that had been noted Nupatree summarized that people that behaved themselves did not really need intoxicants, while people that were normally troublesome due to intoxication found it very hard to get into the trouble without it. He claimed that the citizens were happy with the Act and the only people not happy were the people of “the trade” as he referred to them. He noted that to him the state seemed to focus on the enforcement of laws and the more stringent laws. Nupatree found it strange that the state would focus on this instead of how the North focused on restoring the old wide-open order. Nupatree goes on to praise the state of Georgia and the shape it is in due to prohibition being followed.","By viewing this <em>New York Times</em> newspaper article that contains all the information found above, one can see the debate historians have had when they ask if prohibition was effective or not. If historians look at Nupatree’s observations throughout Georgia it is plain to see that prohibition was very effective. But this effectiveness may be due to what Political Science professors John Frendreis and Raymond Tatalovich suggested that multiple factors like region, religion and demographics play a role in the acceptance or denial of prohibition. Georgia is located in the Bible belt where there is a strong sense of Christianity. Georgia had this one main religion which according to Frendreis and Raymond made prohibition much more effective in the southern region. Nupatree observed there was a wonderful growth, prosperity and an orderly government while he traveled through Georgia. This observation of Nupatree’s shows that urbanization and income had begun to grow in Georgia, and these things factor into the demographics of the state.  This newspaper article shows how a state’s region, religion and demographics can greatly impact the decision of prohibitions like the professors stated.

The distributers name was Hiram R. De Laye and he was the largest distributor in Birmingham. He was arrested because he sold a copy of a newspaper published outside Alabama that had a liquor advertisement within the newspaper. Hiram had to pay a fine that was not less than $50 but no more than $500. Hiram also had imprisonment at hard labor for not more than six months stated in the article. The article stated that, “The Alabama Legislature passed, over the Governor’s veto, a law making this a penal offense.” This would have restricted the state’s citizens to reading mainly home papers and also it would have made citizens mostly stop reading magazines.                                                                                                      News dealers of Alabama tried to rectify the situation by cutting liquor advertisements out of the papers before they delivered them. This ended up being very costly for Laye since he had the largest distribution of the printed press he had to employ more laborers to get the job done. Thenewspaper article then went on to say that Laye would not have to worry about labor for much longer because his customers would soon stop buying papers and magazines if nearly all the material is cut out. A portion of the paper says, “The Birmingham Age-Herald prints a cartoon of an indignant citizen trying to read the report of a battle in Belgium and finding the important part cut out because a liquor advertisement was printed on the back.”  This portion shows that the prohibition act could hamper literature as a whole.","The sheriff of Birmingham got involved and told the press that the city was not trying to make an example out of Laye, but if he continued to violate the law he would be arrested every day he broke the law. The Montgomery Advertiser and The Birmingham News then decided to ignore the law. The article continues to speak on how prohibition is running mad and how human interest should not be sacrificed. Also the article states how if this situation were to logical extremes it would give states with anti-cigarette and anti-racing laws the right to exclude those advertisements in the paper.  Pretty soon the customer would be getting nothing for their money. The article ends with the author trying to bring citizens to his side by saying, “They might enact a law providing that if a citizen takes a drink in Tennessee and crosses into Alabama he should be arrested on the ground that he had carried liquor into the State.”","This <em>New York Times </em>newspaper article shows how there can be complications between the amendments. For instance, just how far do citizens’ rights protect someone when going against the government? Historian Robert M. Entman states that the government influences or determines some of the information citizens receive from the media. If the government sees it will benefit the larger majority of people they will alter information. Entman states that the First Amendment does not prevent the government from shaping most important dimensions of the news media’s messages. Many other news affiliates thought Laye was innocent yet the legislature found him guilty which shows how amendments can clash with each other. This clash ended with Laye being found guilty and being thrown in jail.

There were 1,000 women from the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and 1,000 men from the Anti-Saloon League that marched silently to the capital.  The article states that the ranks were swelled by hundreds of people who joined the march singing “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” and “America” as they were marching. The marchers were met by Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas and Alabama Representative Richmond P. Hobson at the steps of the capital. The group of marchers then proceeded to present multiple petitions that would allow a constitutional amendment to be made so the making and selling of intoxicants in the United States would be prohibited.","After the presentations of the petitions speeches were made by the leaders of the two factions. Both factions seemed to receive warm responses from the two politicians meaning they had obtained their support. Later in the same day Senator Sheppard introduced the proposed constitutional amendment in the Senate. The article says, “the galleries were only half full, but his address in support of the amendment was punctuated with outbursts of applause which Vice President Marshall made no effort to stop.”  The Senator went on to conclude his proposal with these words, “Prohibition will embrace the whole United States within a comparatively short time. The movement is so strong throughout the nation that nothing in the world can prevent its ultimate complete success.” The article ends with saying that Senator Thompson and Owen joined the indorsement of the amendment proposal.","This newspaper article from the <em>New York Times</em> shows precisely what historians have suggested when they speak on how women supported the idea prohibition and this is a firsthand account of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union in action. The article also shows how organizations sought after the support of politicians in order to get the prohibition act into effect. This article fits perfectly with the beliefs of historian Peter Sasso and supports a number of his theses, but the main one being Sasso’s belief that the League was looking for political support. On page forty-seven of his journal Sasso talks about how one of the League leaders, Wayne Wheeler, believed that prohibition could only be accomplished through political advocacy. Gaining political support is one of the ways the League wanted to get prohibition into effect and it is clearly visible in the newspaper article.  Sasso also says how Wheeler sought to control the balance of power in key Congressional districts.

Since the majority of the breweries in the United States were owned by German immigrants and still retained German names, they became a convenient target of both prohibitionist and anti-German crusaders.","The cartoon “Hun Rule Association” was created by the Anti-Saloon League in the period of 1914-1920, when the United States was at war in Europe during World War 1 (Anti-German Prohibition).  It depicts a parade of beer kegs and bottles, many with stereotypical German faces on them, marching and waving placards.  The placards state the supposed ills that the Anti-Saloon League blamed on alcohol consumption.  The use of German imagery and the term “hun,” an anti-German slur, was meant to associate our enemies oversees with the liquor and beer industries, making Prohibition appear patriotic in a sense.  The Anti-Saloon League went as far as to refer to the Milwaukee brewing industry as “the worst of all our German enemies” (Digital History). These enemies that the league spoke out against were, in fact, some of the most successful and industrious immigrants that had come to America, spreading a culture that is still ingrained in the collective American society.  Germans built a flourishing brewing industry and distribution network, dominating saloon business.  They also introduced the concept of beer gardens to America, providing a family-friendly drinking environment that included food, games, and live music in a well-lit, inviting setting (Immigration).","The organization responsible for this and many other anti-German, prohibitionist cartoons was the Anti-Saloon League.  The organization was founded in 1895 by members of the Republican Party as a national, bipartisan organization tasked with the advancement of alcohol prohibition through public support.  It exerted influence on religious leaders and local politicians to allow it to spread its message to the largest number of citizens possible.  The readers of these cartoons created by the League were ordinary patriotic, god-fearing people that were easily swayed by clever rhetoric.  These common folk would then demand that their church leaders and local politicians do their part for the prohibition cause, further strengthening the movement.","The results of cartoons like “Hun Rule Association” were rapid and violent.  German culture was swept under the rug as German music, including that of Beethoven, was no longer played, books were burned, and businesses were boycotted (German Immigration).  German citizens were attacked, beaten, and on occasion lynched as examples to others.  A once proud and substantial portion of the population was forced to hide a proud heritage, one that had already become a major part of American culture.  Financially, the German beer brewing industry faced massive losses when National Prohibition went into effect.  The value of breweries during the period of prohibition dropped as much as two-thirds (Immigration).  The only way that breweries remained in business until alcohol was made legal again was to diversify production, manufacturing barley malt syrup, ‘near beer’, malted milk, and other pantry staples.","“Hun Rule Association” and similar propaganda remain today as examples of misguided crusades against convenient enemies.  The German immigrants that helped to build business and industry in the United States were victimized, but they still retain their place in American society.  Alcohol’s prohibition did little to lessen its supposed effects, namely wife beating, child abuse, corruption, and Machine politics (Digital History).  The Anti-Saloon League is long gone, but beer is a booming business, and German culture is experiencing a resurgence in the United States."],"display_date":"1917 - 1933","search_date":"1925-07-02","locations":[{"id":17541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"},{"id":16292,"lat":43.0070321924,"lng":-87.9667286742,"zoom":10,"place":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"},{"id":18861,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"St Louis, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2478,"tag":"german americans"},{"id":2477,"tag":"world war one"},{"id":2275,"tag":"Anti-Saloon League"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}},{"id":6254,"title":"Revenge is Sweet: H.

During the late 19th century, women's organizations took on temperance as a domestic issue, using it as one of the many reform efforts that justified their activism outside the home. When Progressives took up the cause in the early 20th century, partly out of anit-immigrant sentiment and partly out of concern about decadent public culture, the movement achieved new levels of success. This success culiminated in the passage of the 18th Amendment banning the manufacture and distribution of alcohol. But many Americans and political leaders opposed Prohibition, and calls to end the ban began almost as soon as the new law took effect.","Prohibition in the United States during the 1920s was a constant source of debate and drove criminal activity. Reporters like Baltimore, Maryland's H.L. Mencken wrote constantly about its negative effects. He was among the many Americans who called for its repeal. Mencken, a writer for the Baltimore Evening Sun, was a vocal opponent of the 18th Amendment. He wrote countless columns devoted to the repeal of the 18th Amendment in hopes of bringing about Prohibition’s end.","After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Mencken not only celebrated, he dedicated columns to the exciting news. On April 7, 1933, Mencken was photographed at the Hotel Rennert in Baltimore, Maryland cheerfully accepting and then downing his first public glass of post-Prohibition beer. In his autobiography, published several years after Prohibition, Mencken told a number of  Prohibition stories. His command of language caused the reader to be giddy with laughter one second and fearing for Mencken’s life the next. For example, when asked if he was a federal agent, Mencken replied, “Where did you ever see a prohibition agent who looked so innocent, so moony, so dumb?” Later,  recounted an incident in which he lost his booze to tough looking theives.","H. L. Mencken’s influence on the American people did not dwindle with Prohibition. In fact, using his passion as a driving force, he spoke against the unfair treatment during the First Red Scare as well as injustice acts taken towards African Americans. Mencken used his dedication to get, not only the people of Maryland, but all Americans to expand their views on the changing world around them."," "],"display_date":"April 7, 1933 - April 7, 1943","search_date":"1938-04-07","locations":[{"id":23178,"lat":40.6127984981,"lng":-75.5924733112,"zoom":9,"place":"Lehigh, Pennsylvania"},{"id":23153,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":10,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":600,"tag":"Media"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}},{"id":6277,"title":"Six Prohibition Agents Removed from Alcohol Plant","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"9/1/28","end_date":"10/30/28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During Prohibition, alcohol use was never outlawed entirely; only the manufacturing, selling, transporting, importing, or exporting alcohol was illegal. American citizens were not prosecuted for consuming alcohol, but they had to turn to the illegal liquor trade to have access to alcohol. This made criminals of millions of Americans. As the number of criminals increased at an alarming rate, a proportionate growth of the police force was necessary. But sometimes, enforcing offers engaged in corrupt or illegal activities.","In late September of 1928, six government agents went to work at the United States Industrial Alcohol Company's plant in Curtis Bay, Maryland. The workers, E. L. Wolfe, H. C. Shyrock, J. C. Frederick, C. W. Spence, F. C. McLane, and N. Cullison, were employed by the the Prohibition Department. A few days later, it was alleged that the workers had attempted to divert a carload of alcohol. These men were immediately removed from the plant and asked to resign from their positions.","In the investigation that followed, the six men were alleged to have worked together with whiskey gougers and warehouse agents in order to redirect the alcohol in question. John V. J. Herbert made the charge against the men and removed them from their positions. As prohibition administrator at the local dry unit, Herbert had been their supervisor. Yet, when Herbert was approached by investigators, he refused to discuss the case. He maintained that any information would have to come from the headquarters at Washington.","Investigators did attempt to contact Commissioner Doran at the prohibition headquarters in Washington. However, he was out of town. The acting commissioner, Alf Ofidat, also refused to speak. He said that he “didn't feel authorized to discuss the details of the case.”","The final person interviewed was United States Senator William Cabell Bruce. He reported that two of the workers, Wolfe and Shyrock, had met with him to discuss their defense. The two men told Senator Bruce that they “were not negligent” and that they had “been in government employ long enough to have established reputations.” Senator Bruce was sympathetic, promising to act on their behalf in order to secure a hearing for them with Mr. Doran.","Bruce understood the mens' predicament. The consequences of firing would be harsh, including loss of pension stature for Wolfe. This revelation goes to show the ramifications of the eighteenth amendment on law enforcement were often quite negative. Because so many officers during this time period were turning to corrupt practices, everyone became suspicious of law enforcement members. This gave honest men and women who were in the profession for the right reasons a bad name and reason to be cautious in their everyday duties. This is a stigma that continues to this very day in this profession."," "],"display_date":"September 1, 1928 - October 30, 1928","search_date":"1928-09-30","locations":[{"id":21134,"lat":39.2338595038,"lng":-76.3925904773,"zoom":9,"place":"Baltimore, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":290,"tag":"Crime"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":2541,"tag":"Law Enforcement"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}},{"id":6890,"title":"Women and the 21st Amendment","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"12/18/17","end_date":"12/5/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Women and Prohibition","It is not a new discovery that women have played a significant role in changing the face of America. For example, women pushed desperately to pass the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment (1933) repealing the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment (1919); prohibition. While previous women desperately fought to create the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, none of them truly sought through the possible consequences its implementation could entail. Hence, a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was sought not long after.","            The initial plan women created, the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, was in attempt to “take back the home”. What I mean by this is that women believed that alcohol was the cause for their husbands being drawn away from the home all day, only to come home late and do very awful things to her.[1] In addition to this, women who were suffering from drunken husbands teamed up with the groups of religious people such as the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and males who could vote.[2] With strong effort they were able to successfully pass the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Over the years following, some women continued to celebrate while others began to see a change in light.","            The reason for this is as follows. While alcohol became illegal to sell, it did not prevent people from getting their hands on it and consuming it anyways. Another thing women noticed after the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment was that bars were no longer regulated. This meant they could stay open however late they please and let whom ever they want in. This allowed for the creation of “speak easies” which were basically the old bars but were now being used primarily for illegal actions such as selling black market alcohol. Some other things came from this as well.[3] These included an increase of prostitution, increase in youth drinking, increase in political/government corruption, increase in death, and also did not put an end to most husband’s violent actions.","            Because of these consequences, it was time for action, and action came in the form of a group of strong-willed women. For example, The WONPR, Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, was a women’s organization in support of the soon to be 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Importantly to note, this organization did not want to segregate political parties or previous movement organizations. Due to this, WONPR claimed over 1.2 million members at the beginning of 1933. One thing this organization campaigned on was “the repeal of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment is not defeat”.[4] This was in attempt to show 18<sup>th</sup> amendment prohibition supporters that their actions were in good means, and that it is not a loss but rather a creation for a better, safer way.","Another organization of powerful women who played a role in the creation of the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was the Women’s Organization for Prohibition Reform. For example, Ione Nicoll, secretary of WOPR, saw the destruction of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment and began to look for ways to repeal it. Nicoll frequently brought up that instead of eradicating the evils people faced, prohibition made it worse.[5] To further show her reasonings for why women “should vote wet”, Nicoll explained a study done in 1925 by the Women’s National Republican Club. This study concluded that out of the vast variety of women they surveyed, ninety percent voted to get rid of or make changes to the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Not only did she use facts to back up her reasonings for a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment, she also tried to get female Prohibitionists on her side like the WONPR did.","Though some of the Prohibition supporters were scarred by experiences, others began to see a new light that shined on the creation of a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Overtime these groups of women were able to gain mass support and became successful at repealing prohibition. With one of the campaign tactics being creating alliances, women in the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment were able to get the government, as well as others, on their side. Once this occurred, rapid changes began and the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was created."," "," ","Reference List:","Nicoll, Ione. \"Should Women Vote Wet?\" <em>The North American Review</em> 229, no. 5 (1930): 561-65. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.\">http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.</a>","Rose, Kenneth D. 1996.

The challenge sought to determine whether plebiscites on prohibiting the sale of alcohol were legal. Lawyer W.H. Bouck organized the petition that prompted the vote by Lindsay’s City Council.  The Council’s ruling was a close 5 to 4 decision to hold a plebiscite to ascertain what the future of alcohol sale would be in the community. Col. R.I. Moore, in the wake of the vote, sought to bring it to court to challenge the authority of the decision, based on a claim that some names on the original petition were invalid, and that a reading of the by-law required at least a two-thirds majority.  According to Bouck, the pro-dry petition organizer, the Lindsay City Council should not to concern itself with Moore’s challenge and continue with the plebiscite. Additionally, Bouck outlined his plan for gathering signatures in Toronto as he had in Lindsay. In Toronto, Bouck was attempting to gather 90,000 signatures for a similar plea in the province’s capital. Part of Bouck’s plan was to cross reference the signatures gathered with data from the provincial lists of 1934 to make certain all the names gathered for his petition were in fact from those eligible to vote, making the job of City Clerk Somers easier, and the cross-referencing cheaper and quicker.  (The Globe, May 9th, 1935)   "," ","The broader historical context of the Lindsay case outlined in my article was dominated by the Great Depression, the economic hardships endured by most Canadians, and the legacy of Prohibition. 1935 was a year of great economic hardship across Canada. It was the end of R.B. Bennett and his Conservative Party’s control of Parliament, whose term was marked by failed economic policies, such as the infamous Unemployment Relief Camps and the Bennett Buggies. In fact, the month before the “Beer Vote” article was published, the On-to-Ottawa Trek began as a strike over harsh working conditions and low wages by the workers at Relief Camps, later morphing into a cross-country journey to protest the federal government itself. Over 1000 of these workers “rode the rails” to Ottawa to make their grievances known. This economic situation that permeated Canada in the 1930s connects to the article, perhaps helping to explain R.I. Moore’s opposition to making Lindsay dry, as the sale of alcohol could provide some much-needed stimulus to the local economy, as well as a way for the hard-done-by members of the community to cope. Another key part of the context to consider is broader Prohibition. In Ontario, prohibition lasted from 1916 to 1926, but this article shows that Temperance ideology continued to be an influential movement even after it was repealed. Enclaves of dry communities persisted, like what Bouck wanted Lindsay and Toronto to become.       "],"display_date":"1929 - 1935","search_date":"1932-07-01","locations":[{"id":53226,"lat":44.34792430133,"lng":-78.688675423332,"zoom":11,"place":"Lindsay, Ontario, Canada"}],"tags":[{"id":1630,"tag":"Canada"},{"id":1158,"tag":"Great Depression"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":191,"school_id":28}}]}
