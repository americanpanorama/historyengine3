The <em>Essex</em> had sailed from Nantucket a year ago, scouring two oceans for the whale oil that drove the island’s economy.  On November 20, 1820, the ship was 2000 miles west of South America, over 1200 miles from the nearest island. That day, an eighty-ton sperm whale escaped the pursuing whale boats, attacked the Essex itself, and disappeared into the ocean. The ship, though it remained afloat, was rendered useless, forcing its crew into the small boats. In the weeks ahead, sharks and storms pursued them, threatening to destroy their fragile vessels.","Two months later, adrift amidst the world’s largest ocean, their bodies weak with starvation and dehydration, they cannibalized the dead. “I have,” wrote survivor Owen Chase, “no words to paint the anguish of our souls in this dreadful dilemma. “ Captured in that moment were the desperation and turmoil of an entire cultural perspective. Chase himself related the decision to the deepest questions of religion—their own mortality, the loss of humanity, and the struggle between spirituality and physical necessity. Ethical standards broke down; with no food and no hope of rescue, they drew lots and executed and ate one of their fellow survivors. By the time the last survivors were rescued on February 23, 1821, they had been at sea ninety-six days and been pushed beyond the limits of human endurance. Twelve of the twenty crewmembers had died, six of whom had been cannibalized to sustain the others. Still, in spite of everything, the men returned to their lives in Nantucket, and one by one they returned to the sea.","Embedded in this ordeal were the conflicts of the era’s social and intellectual change. For centuries, whale ship captains had relied on experience and word-of-mouth for knowledge of the oceans they sailed. With the order and rationalization of the nineteenth century emerged entire books devoted to the world’s islands and currents. One such work, Nathaniel Bowditch’s <em>Navigator</em>, revealed the survivors to be only 1200 miles from the Marquesas. The islands, however, were reportedly inhabited by cannibals; though the accounts were unverified, Nantucket conservatism prevailed, and the survivors turned instead for South America. In doing so, in forsaking the rationality of new century for the traditions of old one, they unknowingly condemned eight of their number to death."," "],"display_date":"November 20, 1820 - February 23, 1821","search_date":"1821-01-06","locations":[{"id":6179,"lat":41.2885110748,"lng":-70.2488925622,"zoom":11,"place":"NANTUCKET, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":659,"tag":"whaling"},{"id":660,"tag":"Nantucket"},{"id":661,"tag":"cannibalism"},{"id":662,"tag":"Essex"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":6030,"title":"Cannibalism for a Nose and an Arm: Odawa Retaliation","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1790-09-14","end_date":"1790-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Thomas Gist, the son of an Indian agent in the Ohio Valley, was captured by Huron Native Americans in 1758 and lived with them for a year before being \"released\" and heading west. In a record of his capitivity, Gist describes the relative locations of the major tribes in the area and the state of the land in the area around Fort Pontchartrain (Detroit). In one particularly colorful episode, he recounts an altercation between the Odawa tribe and Sir William Johnson, who had taken a Native American man hostage and cut off his right arm and nose. For revenge, the Odawa captured a Highland soldier, burned him, and subsequently ate his nose and arm. This vicious act of cannibalism stuck out vividly to Gist, who had seen many sides of the Native Americans throughout his stay with them.","This episode is significant as it describes one side of the relations between the Native Americans and the European settlers in the area: the violent side. Not all of the relations at this time were violent like this - in fact, many were entirely peaceful. Gist himself was \"adopted\" into a family during his captivity and treated well. However, the violence of the Native Americans was usually the trait that stuck the most for European settlers. The supposed ferocity of Native American warriors was often used to the advantage of European and American settlers, who used alliances with different tribes to promote their own military aims in struggles over the ownership of the land. Notable battles include the siege of Pontiac on the Fort of Detroit in 1763 and the War of 1812 with involved British and Native American alliances.","To gain the cooperation of the \"fierce\" Native Americans, settlers often gave gifts of liquor and alcohol to the tribes, which they believed would induce a confused and compliant state in the natives. The settlers would then get the Native Americans to sign over land to themselves, and avoid political conflict."],"display_date":"September 14, 1790","search_date":"1790-09-14","locations":[{"id":15297,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"[all counties], Northwest Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":2166,"tag":"European Settlers"},{"id":2165,"tag":"Gist"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":661,"tag":"cannibalism"},{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"},{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
