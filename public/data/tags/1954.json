White residents of Detroit were very reluctant to allow black people live in the same neighborhood so new and returning migrants were confined to live in certain areas away from white neighborhoods. Even though there were inadequate living conditions in these areas, the community was known to be very tight-knit. Because of such a high volume of people living in such a small area, Black Bottom and Paradise Valley had trouble attaining general upkeep of these areas so filth began to slowly build up and the buildings began to diminish because of all of the people living in such confined area.","Mayor Jefferies began working on a plan to create an “urban utopia” with the Detroit City Plan Committee for people who lived in Paradise Valley and Black Bottom. Instead of helping to improve the tight-knit community, city planners decided to raze the area leaving the residence of this area a 30 day evacuation notice. This began the construction of I-75 and Lafeyette Park to the area which millions of black residents called home. One of the city planners, Edward Hustoles, visited Black Bottom and recalled, “a woman sticking her head out of an alley structure, and there was a pile of garbage and a rat sitting there. She looked out the window, over this pile, and said, 'Please don't take my house.” The “slum clearance” which destroyed these communities caused major problems to the city of Detroit. This tight-knit community didn’t want to be destroyed; all they wanted were general improvements to the area they were living in."],"display_date":"1940 - 1955","search_date":"1947-12-31","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2179,"tag":"Mayor Jeffries"},{"id":1954,"tag":"Black Bottom Detroit"},{"id":1953,"tag":"Urban Renewal"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":2014,"tag":"I-75"},{"id":2013,"tag":"Lafayette Park"},{"id":242,"tag":"WWII"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5948,"title":"How Environmental Racism Both Divides &amp; Multiplies Communities","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/35","end_date":"12/31/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Themes of belonging and community permeate the memories of people who grew up in Black Detroit's Eastside Neighborhoods during the twentieth century.","Dorothy Greenfield Hill grew up at St. Antoine and Warren Ave, just off Hastings Street. She recalls that she was a \"great walker\" because her home was centrally located to her community, including a \"hop skip and a jump\" to flower shops, family grocers, Barthwell's Ice Cream Parlor, shoe repair shops, and more. She recalls that neighbors kept an eye on each other and their children, including her, creating a strong sense of unity in raising the community.","Teola P. Hunter, who lived on Medbury Ave., recalls not only being born into a wonderful family, but also \"born into a neighborhood\". She notes that her friends and family were people who were \"poor but proud\" and determined to live their lives to the fullest. Often, her \"family\" was not real family at all as almost everyone on the block was lovingly claimed to be one of her cousins. She also accounts how familiies would often hold \"credit account(s)\" with stores and other businesses in the community so they could get items like groceries in between paydays or if they ran out.","George D. Ramsey, Sr., grew up in a flat at 952 E. Warren Ave, between Hastings and Rivard. He recalls his 18 years of childhood there as his \"Street of Dreams\". He fondly remembers childhood mischiefs, such as peeping through the windows of Cole Funeral Home to look at the bodies, sitting of the porch of noted jazz pianist Will Davis, and jumping across rooftops at the \"Booker T.\" apartment complex. He recalls \"death and despair\" always being present though, like visiting the Astoria Bar where police once shot a man and blood stained the street until next rainfall. Still, living next to a Do Wopp group, musical greatness, and a lively community showed George that great things could be realized in his neighborhood, and he always felt satisfied.","The above accounts are just a few of the many stories shared about the communal spirit of growing up in Black Bottom. There is often the saying that \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and that this held true in Detroit's Eastside. Many previous residents will similiarly reminisice on living with \"aunts\" & \"uncles\" that weren't biologically related, neighbors reprimanding other children as if they were their own, and feeling safe walking alone down the street, even for women at night. These residents knew they were poor, but almost all of them recall never feeling poor or middle class. Within the confines of their neighborhood, many as sheltered children recall feeling rich, and as if they had everything they needed in the world (despite the area having poor environmental conditions such as disease, poverty, and poor safety in housing). Moreover, there are a large amount of documented stories and photographs on the thriving economics of Hastings Street, to which so many residental streets turned off of. Theaters, Black-owned businesses, barborshops, and dime stores, were among many of the attractions along the street. Combined with Paradise Valley next door, it has been often said that neighborhoods of Black Detroit, like Black Bottom, were \"a city within a city\", created by the heavy segregation of the time.","Environmental racism predominantly includes creating the inequal distribution and equality of space, which ultimately defines where and how people live. So while it can be polarizing and destructive (such as between Whites and Blacks within Detroit), Black Bottom and the Black community of Detroit also show how hope can be created within such defined space. Finally, they show how injustly forcing people into a certain situation can bring them closer as a united community - an important revelation for almost all areas of history and stories of oppression."],"display_date":"1935 - 1960","search_date":"1948-01-01","locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1990,"tag":"Hastings Street, Detroit"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":1954,"tag":"Black Bottom Detroit"},{"id":2072,"tag":"Environmental Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5962,"title":"Founding the Detroit Urban League","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/16","end_date":"12/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The United States of America entered World War I (WWI) in 1916. Following their recent involvement in the war caused a boom in the industry production. To supply the new demands for industrial products, many African Americans and women began to migrate to the North in order to find factory jobs. Even though black migrants were trying to escape Jim Crow south, they still found themselves being discriminated in the North. The new black migrants were subjected to living in confined areas in Detroit which in return emerged the Black Bottom and Paradise Valley communities in Detroit. These two communities were known to have outrageous rent and “vile” living conditions.","In 1917 the National Urban League had a conference which praised the city of Detroit as a national model to deal with the migration. Eugene Kinckle Jones who was the director of the National Urban League, went Detroit in 1916 “to lobby For the opening of an affiliate there.” Many black long term residents of Detroit attended the conference and were resentful to Jones organization because they believe that the organization implied that black people needed “special needs.” To deal with the surge of black people in Detroit, white began to over time open their doors to the new migrants. Hospitals, a branch of YMCA, settlement houses, churches, began to allow black people in their facilities. Religion was very helpful for new migrants to feel at home because these places would take care of them."],"display_date":"1916 - 1920","search_date":"1918-07-02","locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2089,"tag":"National Urban League"},{"id":240,"tag":"WWI"},{"id":1964,"tag":"Paradise Valley"},{"id":1990,"tag":"Hastings Street, Detroit"},{"id":225,"tag":"Jim Crow"},{"id":1954,"tag":"Black Bottom Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6000,"title":"True Community...It's a Lifeline","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Lenore Lewis Lawson is an African American woman who grew up on the Near Eastside of Detroit. She lived on Hendrie Street with her parents, brothers and sisters. Her home was just four houses from Hastings (a major thoroughfare in Detroit’s Black community surrounded with small businesses). She said that “she views her years growing up in the old neighborhood as some of the best years of her life”. She explained that it was an area where people knew their neighbors and spoke to them by name. Her neighbors were also very concerned about each other and were always willing to share what they had with each other (e.g. a cup of sugar, or a dime for the street car). The community actively “looked out” for one another. She also talked about the numbers game which could be compared to today’s lottery, although the numbers game was not legal. Therefore the community would shield the numbers man from police because they felt he was a part of their community.","During the period that Ms. Lawson speaks of the proverb “It takes a village to raise a child” was personified in the Near Eastside of Detroit. It was the village and within that village/community were many neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were linked by common bonds of race and religion. It also believed that these neighborhoods were linked by a larger desire by parents that their children would live in a larger world than they had known. Many parents inspired their children to learn about the larger society, the larger world that had evaded them (the parents), and then encouraged them to go out and find or maker their place in it. Family was a paramount fixture in strong communities, it was one of the strongest supports against the injustices of inequality and racism that were present in larger society.","Furthermore community was more than an extension of their families. It was their bridge to the outside world. It was where they lived, worked, and played. Neighbors knew they needed each other in order to give their families the strength and determination to go out into the world and make a difference. This sense of true community has escaped us in many ways in today’s society and it leads to unstable neighborhoods full of residents and no neighbors. Not many areas have a strong sense of community where people can depend on each other let alone know each other’s name."],"display_date":"1940 - 1960","search_date":"1950-07-02","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2124,"tag":"Black Community"},{"id":1954,"tag":"Black Bottom Detroit"},{"id":1990,"tag":"Hastings Street, Detroit"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
