General Lee decided to launch a decisive attack against the army of the Union with the Major General Pickett in command of the troops, which proved to be a strategic error. Melville described the confederate army as \"foredoomed\" from the beginning of this deadly assault.  At first, the southern army seemed to be sent by God to destroy the Union army, in a glorious mission to protect their land. The \"last invader\" charged with power against the opposing army who were defending their lands and the tombs of their ancestors from the cemetery hill. However, in the turn of the attack, fueled with hate and fire, God seemed to abandon the cause of the Confederate States of America. This left their pride challenged by the \"sterner pride\" of the Union army, reinforced by the righteousness of their cause. A picturesque scene followed the battle. The sun set on the dead soldiers of the South, whose corpses would rest in honor and peace on the battlefield.","As Deak Nabers wrote, this poem gave another meaning to the battle of Gettysburg through this romanticized narration of the heroic charge. According to him, Melville showed that something other than might and divinity generated the North's victory: the fact that Gettysburg was already the kind of monument that the battle would make it: a graveyard.","As Melville's biographer Laurie Robertson Lorant wrote, the Civil War poems put the events in historical perspective with a strong bias on Melville's part. According to her, he seemed to concentrate more on what the war revealed about the nation's values than on realistic descriptions of the war, which was the main criticism against his poems.","By the time they were published, Melville's poems actually received a poor welcoming by the public and the critics. However, Melville was among the few Americans writers who wrote about the Civil War: the \"unwritten war\"."],"display_date":"July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-03","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":177,"tag":"literature"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":5028,"title":"Do You Hate Me?","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1802-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A four-year-old boy cries aloud as his grandmother continuously beats him with a club, repeatedly demanding of him, “do you hate me?”  Young William Apess, ignorant of his grandmother’s meaning, knows only to answer in the affirmative, hoping to appease her every wish.  The life of this little boy would have ended at that very moment had his uncle not intervened to rescue him from the brutal beating by his intoxicated grandmother.  Suffering serious injuries to his arm, it would take him the better part of a year to fully recover under the nurture of the neighboring white family Mr. and Mrs. Furman.","The granddaughter of the king of the Pequot tribe and married to a white man, William’s grandmother was reputably a fair and beautiful woman.  The blend in William’s blood would have profound effect on his life and his attitude for the coming years.  William Apess became the first Native American to publish an autobiography in 1829.  The theme of his autobiography <em>A Son of the Forest</em> ostensibly highlights the failure of white men to see the hypocrisy in denying Native Americans the “self-evident” rights guaranteed to all mankind. Apess further condemns the whites for referring to his kind as heathens while treating them in the most un-Christian way.  Though brought up largely by Native Americans under meager conditions, Apess grew to be immersed into the life and culture of a white man where he became a Methodist preacher.  What is most striking then about the narrative of his beating is that it is infused with hatred to the whites.  After telling of his grandmother’s actions, Apess remarks, “But this cruel and unnatural conduct was the effect of some cause-I attribute it in a great measure to the whites.”  Though he concentrates little on his feelings toward his grandmother and his family at the age of four, Apess clearly blames the whites for introducing these “ardent spirits” in the same sentences that pontificate her dangerous and ravenous beatings.  Even though Apess had become “successful” as a white man, he remained true to what he referred to as his red roots because of the discrimination that faced him at every turn.  Through the complexities of his attitude toward the white culture that could accept him only when he became one of them, one thing is clear: William Apess lived a life that faced the perpetual paradox of praise and blame, success and shame, heroism and betrayal.  Because of his multifarious heritage, he was forced to beg the question to the conglomeration of persons in his life, “do you hate me?”"],"display_date":"1802 - 1825","search_date":"1813-12-31","locations":[{"id":15849,"lat":42.2902620083,"lng":-70.9709524989,"zoom":9,"place":"Norfolk, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":497,"tag":"Writing"},{"id":177,"tag":"literature"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":696,"tag":"Native American issues"},{"id":697,"tag":"Historiography"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5185,"title":"From Infantryman to Staff Officer: The Battle of Chickamauga Through the Eyes of Ambrose Bierce","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-09-19","end_date":"1863-09-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bierce writes, “They were men. They crept upon their hands and knees. They used their hands only, dragging their legs. They used their knees only, their arms hanging idle at their sides. They strove to rise to their feet, but fell prone in the attempt.” Through chilling words Ambrose Bierce illustrated the battlefield at Chickamauga in his short story,<em> Chickamauga</em>. Bierce, a writer and soldier, held a view of the battlefield of Chickamauga on September 19-20,1863, that few knew. His rank kept him acquainted with the everyday solider, but his horse and job gave him a vision that the ordinary soldier was not afforded. Bierce was a member of the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment under William B. Hazen. His unit was at the core of the fighting under General Thomas’s forces on Snodgrass Hill during the Battle of Chickamauga. This was not only one of the most important battles of the Civil War but also for Ambrose Bierce.","Before Chickamauga, Bierce had been an infantryman in Hazen’s Brigade. After attracting the attention of his superiors, Bierce was promoted in April of 1863 to Hazen’s acting topographical officer, “his commander’s personal map maker who became his ‘eyes’ prior to battle”, writes David Owens. This role of topographical officer was at the center stage of any officer corps but was often overlooked. Chickamauga was his first major battle with his new title. His new role required him to be very familiar with the battlefield terrain, and this familiarity made Bierce’s memoir significant as it provided him a larger view of battle as he roamed on horseback, was in constant contact with high-level officers, and was directly involved in strategic high-ranking military planning. Moving from infantryman to staff officer greatly expanded his view of the war, and this would be reflected in his later writings.","His memoir, <em>Chickamauga</em>, told the story of this battle through a highly emotional and graphic lens. It was written in 1889 for the San Francisco Examiner, where he could write without fear of editorial constraints. In this intense short story, a little boy found himself lost in the woods among wounded men crawling to a creek. He innocently went among them looked into their faces and tried to play with them. Bierce wrote, “But on and ever one they crept, these maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic contrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity”. He made his way back home to found it on fire and his mother dead. This loss of the child’s innocence to the brutality of war was perhaps a reflection of the loss of innocence throughout the United States as people at home and on the battlefield experienced this horrific war. Bierce’s role as a topographer paired with his writing skills provided a view of the Battle of Chickamauga that is intensely chilling and vividly detailed, something that cannot be seen in battle reports but only through the eyes of someone in contact with both the officer and the infantryman."],"display_date":"September 19, 1863 - September 20, 1863","search_date":"1863-09-19","locations":[{"id":12053,"lat":35.1803733014,"lng":-85.1633326083,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"},{"id":2308,"lat":34.7357841762,"lng":-85.3009353974,"zoom":9,"place":"WALKER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":177,"tag":"literature"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}}]}
