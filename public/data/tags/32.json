The Quartermaster sergeant of the 48th Pennsylvania, Joseph Gould, wrote his history of the regiment, \"It [the explosion] was a magnificent spectacle; the mass of earth went up into the air, carrying with it men, guns, carriages and timber, which spread out like an immense cloud, as it reached its altitude.\"  Thus began the Battle of the Crater, infamous for the chaotic slaughter that occurred among the Union troops stuck in the explosion's crater, which, according to Colonel Pleasants, \"was at least 200 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 25 feet deep.\" However, the crater was simply the end result of a long process started by a coal miner's boast.","            According to historian James McPherson, Pleasants, \"a prewar mining engineer,\" overhead one of his men say, \"We could blow that damn fort out of existence if we could run a mine shaft under it.\"  <em>The Official Records of the War of the Rebellion</em> contains a letter written on June 24, 1864 by General Potter to his corps commander, Major General Ambrose E. Burnsides, regarding the \"feasibility of mining the enemy's work in my front.\"  According to historian Alfred James, Burnsides approved the plan and work began on the mine, June 25, 1864.","             The excavation was not easy, even for the men of the 48th who were experienced miners from Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.  Pleasants described the lack of proper mining equipment.  Makeshift picks, bridge planks and cracker-boxes were used instead of the usual equipment.  The miners also ran into wet quicksand-like soil that Pleasants called \"marl\" which caused a section of the mine to collapse on July 2, and had difficulty circulating fresh air into the 510.8 foot long mine shaft.  Pleasants solved these problems by digging over the wet marl and adding a ventilation shaft to circulate the air. The miners dug an average of forty feet a day.","             The main gallery was completed on July 17.  That same day, work on the lateral galleries was halted due to Confederate counter-mining.  Work resumed on July 18 and the left and right lateral galleries were completed on July 23, but James wrote that \"in this last stage of actual mining, the Union miners heard Confederate countermining.\"  Pleasants was ordered to \"charge the mine\" on July 27, with \"320 kegs of powder, each containing about twenty-five pounds.\"  On July 29, Pleasants received orders \"to fire the mine at 3:30 AM, July 30.\"","            According to McPherson, when the mine exploded, \"one entire rebel regiment and an artillery battery were buried in the debris,\" and the Confederates around the crater scattered in fear.  However, as a result of last minute changes and inept leadership from Burnside and his subordinates, the attack on the crater was a complete failure for the Union. James recounted the Union losses of 4,400 troops to the Confedercy's 992 total casualties.  Despite the failure of the final attack it can not be denied that the mining of the 48th Pennsylvania created a new tactic in Civil War era trench warfare.

Spitting and yelling at soldiers from the north and refusing to even acknowledge their presence in the streets, even when the soldiers were offering the women assistance. There were many hostile feelings between the north and the south that were not healed simply with the capture of the city into Union hands.  Although New Orleans had been captured without any blood being shed, the citizens of New Orleans still felt the sting of the hardships that their fellow confederates were enduring.  ","            With the end of the war many reformations began within southern cities, specifically, the role of women within the community. In the modern city, women had a place where they could gather together and find strength and support in numbers as well as have social and political achievements without the help of men.  In rural southern areas, it was more difficult for women to bond together and make changes, mainly because of a lack of numbers and because the rural women were too busy working their land and trying to make a living.  In the city during the war, women held jobs that men left behind when they went to fight.  When male soldiers returned, women had to return to their predominately domestic lives.  Northern troops began to occupy southern cities in order to make sure that they were reconstructing, and not re-enslaving the people the north had worked so hard to free.  Because only men served as soldiers during the war, women looked for ways to display their patriotism and support for the southern states in alternative manners.  Southern women in a way had more power than northern women because they still had a cause that they felt they had to depend, even though the war was lost. ","            In April of 1862, Major General Benjamin F. Butler and his troops were in charge of the occupation of New Orleans.  Butler describes in his autobiography that the men of the city of New Orleans did not interfere with the soldiers in any way.  However, whenever women of the city would come into contact with any of these Yankee soldiers, they would shoot them hateful glances, make derisive comments, and flee the area.  In the minds of these women, they were fulfilling the patriotic duties that they were denied when they were not able to serve as soldiers.  The women were hoping that their mistreatment of these soldiers would force the soldiers to retaliate, and therefore give the city of New Orleans a solid argument for expelling them.  ","            Soldiers were hesitant to arrest the young women in the street causing the ruckus, due to they fact that they were typically high-class women and a scene would be caused.  Also, the women clearly would have almost appreciated being arrested; so they would have even more of a reason to be indignant.  Since the northern soldiers did not know how to handle this criticism coming from southern ladies, Major General Butler issued an order instructing the soldiers how to deal with situations such as these.  He instructed his men to treat the rebellious women as if they were prostitutes.   ","            After Major General Butler issued this order, the insults immediately stopped.  Although women were willing to be arrested in order to express their \"patriotism\", they were not willing to be looked upon as prostitutes, or even as someone of a lower class.  Prostitutes were viewed by middle and upper class women to be the lowliest people in society.  Even though many changes came about in the years after the Civil War, class structure was still a strong influence, and a strong part of a woman's identity.

Made up of volunteer men from the Philadelphia area, these troops moved shortly after their formation into Maryland to be on call as soon as they were needed for battle.  They went into many of the first battles of the war including First Bull Run, different skirmishes, and the battle of Antietam.  From this position they moved to Falmouth, Virginia; where they expected to stick out the winter months, but in December a four-day battle lasting from the twelfth to the fifteenth in Fredericksburg demanded the 90th's assistance.    The original plan laid out by General Burnside required the placement of pontoon bridges supplied by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the bridges were not ready in time, and the forces of the CSA had ample time to assemble and prepare for the attack.","            During this four-day siege John Shields who hailed from Cresson, Cambria County, Pennsylvania preformed an act of valor that would earned him the Medal of Honor.  On December 13, the second day of the battle, while under heavy fire, Private John \"Shiel\" Shields carried a dangerously wounded comrade back to Union lines so that the stricken man would not be captured by the Confederate forces.  His act of fraternity was considered extremely brave, yet dangerous considering the amount of gun fire being unleashed upon the men, making it extremely possible that Shields too would be wounded and eventually captured by Confederate forces.  Shields' luck did not run out at this particular battle, however, he survived the rest of the war, including fighting at the Gettysburg and Spotsylvania and Spotsylvania Court House. Thirty-two years after the end of the war, Shields was given his medal for his bravery at Fredericksburg.  The delay for his reward was never explained, however one could deduce that following the assassination of President Lincoln, the near impeachment of President Johnson, and the mess of Reconstruction in the South, that Congress had their hands full.

Kaiser of Winston County passionately wrote down the concerns of his fellow Confederate supporters at the meeting conducted on November 30, 1861 in Alabama.  Winston County is a small, rural county in the upper northwest corner of Alabama.  The county was a pro-Union county that was creating a disturbance in the Confederate state.  In Dr. Kaiser’s letter, he emphasizes the wishes of the citizens to remain anonymous unless otherwise instructed by the need of the Confederacy or the need of the Great State of Alabama.  He claims that these individual loyalists are willing to make themselves known and accept responsibility for their actions or lack there of in supporting the Confederate States of America.  The purpose of the meeting was to contain the rebellion in Winston County as best as could be done.  These people feared that if the loyalists’ notions remained unchecked, their hostility could fester into open rebellion.  He discusses the large number of loyalists in comparison to Confederate supporters.  Dr. A. Kaiser states that many of these loyalists have banded together as Union militia.  He then emphasizes the visit of a very prominent person to Winston County in attempt to win over the disenchanted Unionists and claimed that the spirit of rebellion only seemed to be strengthened by Mr. George S. Houston’s visit.  He then urges the intervening into the matter by Governor John Gill Shorter to halt the rebellion.  Dr. Kaiser then exclaims that all citizens of Winston County should take an oath of allegiance and if they refuse to do so should be treated as aliens.  Finally, he claims that the governor should mandate a requirement of two hundred and fifty volunteers for the Confederate Army to serve in the Civil War.","Citizens in Winston County, Alabama were extreme loyalists.  The citizens of the county met at  Looney’s Tavern in which the members of the county voted to leave the State of Alabama.  Over two thousand five hundred individuals from Winston County were in attendance at the meeting.  The meeting was attended by individuals from several other counties as well, for example Lawrence, Blount, Walker, Fayette, Marion, Marshall, and Franklin counties.  The loyalists in attendance at the meeting drafted resolutions to resolve the issues of loyalty.  The first resolution was to commend the representatives of these counties who were in attendance at the Secession Convention for remaining loyal to their constituents.  The second resolution stated that these individuals supported Jacksonian principles that no state could leave the Union; however, if this was not true, then these citizens felt that counties had the same rights to secede from the state through the same reasoning.  The final resolution was that the citizens instituted a neutrality statement that they preferred to be left alone rather than fight against their neighbors in the South or against America.  These resolutions drafted by the large number of anti Confederate supporters in the upper northwest counties of Alabama display the underlying theme resounding throughout American history that the Civil War was a war fought for economic reasons not states’ rights as the Southern states claimed.  "],"display_date":"December 3, 1861","search_date":"1861-12-03","locations":[{"id":414,"lat":34.147691174,"lng":-87.2600796897,"zoom":10,"place":"WINSTON, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":224,"tag":"Winston County, Alabama"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4654,"title":"Unionist Sentiments in Alabama","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-07","end_date":"1861-12-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["P.C.

A very thoughtful and god fearing young man, Acheson enlisted during the three-month call for volunteers in 1861 and was involved with riling up more volunteers in Washington County. On September 4, 1862, the Washington regiments marched to Pittsburgh to begin their tour of duty.","The 140th Pennsylvania Volunteers subsequently marched to Harrisburg to, as Sara Gould Walters remarked, \"transform [themselves] into soldiers.\" The men received tents, knapsacks, haversacks and muskets to go along with their dark blue blouse, trousers, caps and shoes.

McCausland set the city of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania ablaze on the morning of July 30, 1864.  According to a letter sent the following day by D. McConaughy to Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin and Major General Darius N. Couch, the commander of the Susquehanna Military District, the \"lowest estimate of loss [from the fire] is 1,500,000.\"  He reported that the Confederate soldiers \"fired the whole center portion of the town, embracing twenty squares.\"  Historian Everard H. Smith claimed that a little over half of the 6,000 natives of Chambersburg lost their homes in the fire.  McConaughy wrote that the town was ostensibly burned because McCausland did not receive a 600,000 ransom, of which he demanded 100,000 be paid in gold.  However, there are a few other reasons why Chambersburg, a seemingly unimportant city in Pennsylvania's Cumberland Valley, was burned to the ground in such an appalling fashion.  ","Chambersburg was not a randomly chosen target for retribution.  Its location in the Cumberland Valley, the Pennsylvania name for the Shenandoah Valley, granted easy access for the Confederate army. It also had some strategic value for the North.  According to historian William Vatavuk, General Robert E. Lee sent General J.E.B. Stuart to Chambersburg in October, 1862 to gather supplies from Chambersburg and burn a railroad bridge that provided a \"vital transportation link to the west.\"  Smith offered that the Confederate soldiers had a sense of superiority over the common, predominantly German population in the area, and were thus able to dehumanize them.  Smith further asserted that dehumanizing their enemy allowed the southern soldiers to adhere to Carl von Clauswitz's belief in the necessity of total warfare.","The burning of Chambersburg was seen in the North as a Confederate atrocity.  Smith wrote that \"drunken Confederates cavorted among the ashes, pillaging freely and robbing citizens of sums large and small.\"  According to McConaughy, even McCausland was drunk.  Smith related that Confederate soldiers locked two women in their houses and set them ablaze, but fortunately, both women were rescued by neighbors.  Many of the citizens, like the family of Captain Eyster, whom McConaughy described in his letter, got out of their houses with only the clothes on their backs.  Even Confederate soldiers were not immune to the effects of the catastrophe unfolding around them.  According to Vatavuk, when a woman carrying a dying baby in her arms asked a soldier, \"'is this revenge sweet?' a tender chord was touched, and without speaking, he burst into tears.\"","            The effects of the fires may have been difficult for the citizens of Chambersburg to bear, but according to Vatavuk, a \"scorched earth policy\" was being practice by Union generals William T. Sherman and David Hunter before the ransack of Chambersburg.  Vatavuk asserted that Confederate General Jubal Early had Hunter's attacks on his mind when he included in McCausland's orders that the burning of Chambersburg was \"… in retaliation for acts of destruction committed by General Hunter in the Valley of Virginia.\"","            By the time McConaughy wrote his letter on July 31, 1864, the heart of Chambersburg was destroyed by the fire.  The flames consumed public and private buildings alike and northern soldiers under General William Averell, were in pursuit of McCausland's forces.  Regardless of the reason, the city of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania was in ruins.

The migration introduced new eager American citizens to the north during a time when new faces were foreign faces. For African Americans, the lure of freedom from Jim Crow laws, a higher and fairer wage for labor, and a fresh start to life was reasons enough to move to \"the promised land\". New York among other big cities was the destinations of choice for African Americans. The newly emancipated African Americans brought to the north a lifestyle they adapted to in the south. This lifestyle became integrated into communities African Americans inhabited. My primary source is a postcard from the early 1900's of Forest Avenue in New York City depicting a Congregationalist church at a corner street in a supposedly black neighborhood. The postcard not only depicts many traits of the turning century, but also provides small but significant insight into how the church acted as an aid and an outlet for those making not only a transition into a new century but also a social and cultural transition at the same time.","            The settlement in the north proved the church served as an alleviation and refuge from the acclimation to a strange new home and community. The church's role in the north was often similar to the way it was in the south during slavery. As conditions in New York became overcrowded, places of worship were hard to find among the busy streets. However once churches were developed, often being erected from older buildings, the church served as the center of a community. One of my supporting sources is also a primary source that is a newspaper article describing the events of the dedication of a new location for the <em>Forest Avenue Church</em>. Before it took the name <em>First Congregational Church of Morrisania</em> it was known as <em>Forest Avenue Congregational Church </em>and was established in 1851. The dedication described by <em>The New York Times</em> was not a long article, but gave only the basic details of the ceremony. The actual ceremony was long and included many keynote area speakers indicating this was a significant event for the community. The African American population boom brought new ideologies in denomination and Christian perspectives and accounted for more and more African American churches and communities springing up. Once many African Americans migrated north religion and worship continued to be a very key practice. However, the spirit and style of African American worship changed significantly once the migration occurred. More specifically was the Negro spiritual and how song and dance was incorporated in church. The worship services were not as stringent as they were in the South and for good reason because they now had reason to celebrate their deliverance. As this \"second emancipation\" occurred northern cities and people were forced to handle the product of victory in the Civil War. ","            Like many foreign immigrants, African American immigrants had to live in close quarters and earn small wages. They escaped much of the discrimination experienced in the south, yet hardships were not far off. Religion was a backbone of African American life in the south, and it was the same in the north. The church was able to unveil the well-beaten Underground Railroad allowing many more African Americans to travel northward. This was a time of change in American history that ushered in new developments for regional development and identity. Along with providing a link between the north and the south, the African American migration and subsequent expansion of the church provided a visibly direct by-product of the events of slavery and Civil War.

In many cases, the battle spilled out of the field into the town and destroyed houses and yards.  Knox's dispatch went into a detail about just what happened to the town and outlying areas of Gettysburg.","The battlefield after Gettysburg was exactly what one would think: a war-torn landscape.   Artillery fire destroyed most of the landmarks of the time.   Knox says that cemeteries, or at least one in particular, had shattered headstones, horse-trodden graves, and destroyed shrubbery.  Breastworks were erected to prevent cavalry charges lined the battlefield and mounds of dirt supported artillery batteries.  Soldiers trampled fences and lawns.  This turned a beautiful countryside and fields into a dirty, corpse-filled, war-torn landscape.","However, in the past 150 years, Gettysburg has been turned back into a beautiful country town.

As it stands now, Gettysburg is a national park to commemorate the people who died there.  The copse at Gettysburg had shifted thirty feet upwards due to the growth of oak trees.  Black says this is because environments are rarely unchanging.  This dynamic environment shows people a field far different from what generals Robert Edward Lee and George Gordon Meade saw, but if one wants to look and find out where the soldiers were and where they battled, they need only to see the breastworks and mounds erected, still marking the field as a battleground."],"display_date":"July 9, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-09","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":87,"tag":"Environment"},{"id":88,"tag":"Battle"}],"course":{"name":"American Civilizations to 1877","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":20,"school_id":9}},{"id":4537,"title":"Jefferson Davis Finds a Friend in Prison","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Around May 10 1865, federal troops captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis fleeing in Georgia and sent him to be confined in Fortress Monroe, Virginia.

According to a war memo excerpted in a New York Times article, he was not arraigned upon any indictment or formal charge of crime but had been indicted for high treason by the Grand Jury of the District of Columbia. Davis was also charged with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the murder of Union prisoners of war by \"starvation and other barbarous and cruel treatment toward them.\" Colonel Stewart's (working in the fortress) account denotes a tone of disgust towards Davis' situation in the Richmond Times Dispatch: \"It appears to us ...in chaining the feet of President Davis, under the poor pretext of rendering imprisonment more secure, was to humiliate not only the prisoner, but the people of the whole South, and to them...will be ever linked with the infamy.\" Davis was also chained whilst incarcerated as per order of General Miles. The guards' cruel and disrespectful treatment took a great toll on his health, leaving him emaciated and even sensitive to light. Describing the shackling of Mr. Davis, Dr. John J.

From then on, the relationship of doctor and patient developed into an abiding friendship.

At the appointed hour, the Sixth Army Corp of the Army of the Potomac, charged forward and carried the enemy works.  \"In so doing,\" wrote Hean, \"the enemy opened with artillery and infantry, causing the first two lines to waver, bringing all lines close to mass, with the third line (93rd) as a front, which as first to plant the colors upon the works.\"   ","Hean officially gave credit to a Corporal Jacob Renkenberger for \"planting the first color upon the enemy's works.\"  However, in the history of the regiment, written by Captain Penrose Mark, Sergeant Charles Marquette was given credit for the feat, and \"was awarded a Medal of Honor by Congress for being one of the first to plant the colors on the breastworks.\"","According to Samuel Bates' <em>History of Pennsylvania Volunteers</em>, Charles Marquette was mustered into Perseverance Company 2, also known as Company F of the 93rd Pennsylvania regiment, on Oct 12, 1861.

In fact Sauers gave him credit for planting the first flag on the enemy's works and capturing a Confederate flag. In light of the fact that Marquette was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions that day, it is probable that he did accomplish both things.

General Lee decided to launch a decisive attack against the army of the Union with the Major General Pickett in command of the troops, which proved to be a strategic error. Melville described the confederate army as \"foredoomed\" from the beginning of this deadly assault.  At first, the southern army seemed to be sent by God to destroy the Union army, in a glorious mission to protect their land. The \"last invader\" charged with power against the opposing army who were defending their lands and the tombs of their ancestors from the cemetery hill. However, in the turn of the attack, fueled with hate and fire, God seemed to abandon the cause of the Confederate States of America.

The 47th was active in the Western theater during the whole war, aside from the Vicksburg campaign, but the little everyday facts show better what war was like. ","The drummer boy, Henry Lawson Bert, had a tough life in the camp. Most of the time he had to perform chores, walk endlessly in the forest to unknown places, obey orders that he did not really understand and get along with his mates. Life in the war consisted in dealing with other people: some of them, bored to death, had nothing better to do than look for fights with everybody and hide personal belongings in silly places. They often lacked food, and boredom was omnipresent. Like other drummer-boys, Bert was part of the war, but did not fight like the other soldiers. However, it did not prevent them from dying like the other soldiers. Bert's regiment was not very active during the winter and stayed in the same spot most of the cold months without going to fight. Like other soldiers, Bert dreamt of action and battles during these long periods of inactivity and cold boredom, to get closer to the goal of the war. To enhance the boredom, the pay checks were delayed for a long time, which prevented the drummer boy from enjoying time in the cities and activity. The young generation was despaired by the war going on, and \"crushing slavery from out of the land\" and restoring peace were the only goal of the drummer boy, a \"poor soldier.\"  He hoped for a trustworthy government and a united country again and was convinced of the bad moral of the Confederates and of the imminent victory.

Baseball also served as a means of something that connected the civilians with the soldiers.

Many other letters were sent as well, soldiers sharing stories of their baseball games rather than stories of war. Baseball proved to be very helpful for many in getting through the day in and day out life of a soldier during the Civil War. \"Suddenly there was a scattering of fire, which three outfielders caught the brunt; the centerfield was hit and captured, left and right field managed to get back to our lines. The attack…was repelled without serious difficulty, but we had lost not only our centerfield, but… the only baseball in Alexandria, Texas\" George Putnam said in a letter from his Union army camp.

The prison was overcrowded with prisoners crammed in rooms, inactive and secluded from society, lacking food, exercise and fresh air. The atmosphere was so polluted that people could hardly breathe. The promiscuity made sickness spread in a heartbeat, and in the winter of 1865, the prison witnessed an epidemic of what was called hospital gangrene, in addition to the usual scourges of diarrhea, dysentery and scorbutus. The assistant surgeon of the hospital reported that the epidemic was due to all these factors. Gangrene started from a bacterial infection in a wound and could spread to the whole body and eventually kill the patient if not handled in time. In the hospital, out of 325 patients, 208 died over the three months before January. Usually gangrene could be handled easily, but the hospital was so over-burdened and not prepared to medical care, that far more people died than typical. The patients of the prison's hospital formed a crew of 1,600 to 2,000 people, who slept in tents, with at least five other persons. They wore their battle clothing that they had not washed in six months or more. In their state, they needed strong food that could give them strength, but the hospital could not provide it for them. The medicines that the hospital received lasted only for ten days, and then they had to accommodate with what they could, such as vegetables picked in nature around the hospital. They were in such a lack for medicine that they had to carry out experiments on the patients, out of natural plants that they picked up in the countryside.  The good will of the surgeons was not to question though, they were at peace with God and with themselves by trying all that was possible to improve the conditions of the prisoners. ","This report reveals the conditions of prisoners of war Andersonville, the most infamous of prisons. Many of them entered in good health and caught lethal diseases there. According to Freemon, hospital gangrene was a sickness in which skin tissues became black, and it happened only in certain hospitals, due to horrific sanitary conditions. He believed that the hands of the surgeons themselves could be responsible for the spread of the disease from a wound to the other.

Stevens who proposed a rather obscure idea to deal with the Confederate trenches.  The Colonel explained to Grant that he could lead a team of soldiers to construct a T-shaped series of mineshafts directly underground, parallel to the Confederate trenches.  Grant, who was looking for a way to occupy the minds of his depressed and unenthusiastic soldiers, gave the Colonel the order to commence with his obscure plan.  Grant saw the plan as a way to bring the soldiers together and accomplish something positive: a welcome feeling for the soldiers who had experienced continuous defeats charging on the Confederate trenches at Petersburg.","            With this knowledge, one can come to the conclusion that the mine shaft, which would eventually be packed full of explosives and produce the “Battle of Crater,” was constructed through busy-work, thought to be a meaningless task.  Also, some scholars find it ironic that many of the men who were mining the hillside were digging their own graves.  As our historian Suderow points out, it was not Grant’s wish to create such death and destructing with his mining operation; but, war never goes as planned as illustrated through this series of bloody events."],"display_date":"June 20, 1864 - July 26, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-08","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":303,"tag":"Battle of Petersburg"},{"id":304,"tag":"Battle of the Crater"},{"id":305,"tag":"Mining Operation"},{"id":306,"tag":"Mining"},{"id":307,"tag":"Mine"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4755,"title":"Waul's Texas Legion in the Battle of Vicksburg","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-12","end_date":"1863-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The morning officially began at 10:00 AM as the war-weary men of Waul’s Texas Legion lined up shoulder to gray-clad shoulder in Vicksburg, Mississippi; the perfect time for brunch.  But it would forever remain in the minds of the Confederates as the beginning of a fight for their everything-- land, honor, freedom, liberty, property—at the one site most important to hold for any chance of Confederate victory—Vicksburg. The city was strategically placed along the Mississippi River, and until the city and Fort Hill were held by Union colors, the United States army’s supplies would be severely limited upstream.","Waul’s Texas Legion, commanded by Col. Thomas Neville Waul, moved at dawn into position, and as the first shots rang out that morning, their hearts were pumping with the blood of bravery that would lead to a crucial, life-threatening mission later that day. At 10:00AM, Grant’s Union army attacked the city of Vicksburg where the entirety of Lieutenant General Pemberton’s army, including Waul’s Texas Legion, was stationed. Two of Waul’s companies were sent to Fort Hill to re-take the garrison from enemy forces at all costs. Thirty-five men were chosen from the ranks, charging valiantly into direct shell and Minie ball fire for the covert, high-stakes mission of slipping undetected inside the fort as its weak spot. The fort was re-taken amidst smoke, blood, the stench of death and the deafening sound of cannon balls echoing in the near-distance, and Waul’s men earned their colors that day; a small price to pay for the death of nearly 500 comrades. Col. T. N. Waul was a man with a law degree and Congressional experience who ended up as a colonel because of a defeat in the CSA Congress. He resolved from that day forth to never lose again.","Later that day, the men under Col. Wrigley, the commander of the 2<sup>nd</sup> battalion of infantry under Waul, discovered a hidden bunch of Union soldiers hiding in a ditch. They found a parapet and fired down upon their enemy, contributing to the Union death toll of nearly 4,000. The day ended with the drums and fifes cheerily hastening the men back to camp following their beloved colors to deeply mourn the loss of nearly every captain who had been with them earlier that morning. Back at camp, the rations were steadily declining, with Captain William Edgar instructing the troops to eat ‘mule meat and fricasseed cat’.

Lee and Ulysses S. Grant had settled into trench warfare in the area just to the south of Richmond, with the U.S. Army attempting to cut the railroad supply line into the Confederate capital.  After numerous unsuccessful assaults on the Confederate line, a Union officer named Henry Pleasants had the idea to dig a mine underneath the Confederate breastworks, plant explosives, and detonate an explosion that would collapse the center of the line and allow for a U.S. attack.  After approval of the idea, the mine was dug and successfully blown up, creating a hole in the Confederate line.  The federal troops, however, were disorganized due to mismanagement at the command level and took too much time in attacking the C.S. position.  This allowed the Confederate commander, Brig. General William Mahone, to organize a counterattack and drive the U.S. troops out of the crater and back to their own breastworks.","            Captain Charles E.

Ulysses S. Grant, the plan was put in action by pulling man power from the front lines and giving life to the mining operation.  Unlike any other position around Petersburg, the Union mining operation actually gained ground from the enemy; they were even able to do so without Confederate knowledge.  This covert advance, interestingly, did not go without suffering and even casualties.  Hugh Thos, a Union Captain and leader of the mining campaign, depicts the grim lifestyle of the miners for his superiors: “These men are entirely without cooking utensils, and none are to be had…I would also call your attention to the fact that there [is] an insufficiency of medicine… a great many of the men are sent to hospitals…”  In a later report, Thos writes to his superiors, “one of the engineer troops wounded at Gracies mine last night; two men have been wounded at Pegrams, mine No. 2”  Hugh Thos discloses these wounded men at the end of his letter, just as he would in a traditional brief concerning the outcome of a battle.","            As conventional attacks continued to fail the Union in their quest to capture Petersburg, the mine became more and more of a crutch for Grant to fall back on.  One day, after a particularly devastating loss against the Confederates, Grant was informed that the mine was finished and ready to be loaded and primed.  Grant gave the mining company the order to pack the mine full of black powder and prepare for an all-out assault on the Confederate trenches.  But, knowing the history of the mining campaign, historians and scholars alike recognize that the Battle of the Crater and its inflicted suffering began long before the Confederates were able to acknowledge the attack."],"display_date":"June 20, 1864 - July 26, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-08","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":307,"tag":"Mine"},{"id":306,"tag":"Mining"},{"id":304,"tag":"Battle of the Crater"},{"id":303,"tag":"Battle of Petersburg"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4716,"title":"Damage to the Confederate Line at the Battle of the Crater","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-07-30","end_date":"1864-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["           The Battle of the Crater in the early stages of the Petersburg campaign resulted in a massive amount of damage to the center of the C.S.A. breastwork.  In the early stages of the Petersburg campaign, as the battle settled into trench warfare, a Union officer named Henry Pleasants hatched a plan to dig, plant explosives, and explode a mine in the middle of the Confederate breastwork.  This would give the United States army an avenue to exploit and access to their target: the Petersburg railroad junction.  After some delay and confusion in the early hours of July 30, 1864, the mine was successfully blown up, but disorganization on the Union side kept the attack from commencing immediately.  This gave the Confederate general, William Mahone, long enough to mount and execute a counterattack that drove the Federal troops out of the crater, inflicting heavy losses on a majority black division in the process.","            Captain William Whitner was serving as the Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General for this part of the Confederate Army at the time, and wrote to his superiors about the damage that the defensive breastwork suffered in the explosion and subsequent attack.  Whitner described the damage as blowing up “a considerable portion of the main parapet – more than half,” as well as Confederate guns being thrown over forty yards as a result of the explosion.  The mine exploded directly beneath a Confederate battery, and according the Whitner’s account, throwing one cannon “at least twenty yards and the other forty yards from the point they were in position.”  Whitner also vouched for the counterattack made by General Mahone after the initial explosion and Federal attack.  Whitner’s account was used by the Confederate command to assess the potential damage should the Union attempt to use the same tactic again, and reinforced the need for Confederate generals to protect their defenses from all sides, including underground.  His account is very cut and dried, with little to no exaggeration, but his job as inspector general required the simple facts about the events so that his superiors could correctly assess the necessary actions to take in the future.","            The Battle of the Crater is a well-known event in Civil War History;

Often, however, those involved in these critical moments do not realize their own significance. On April 9, 1862, Colonel Samuel Beatty, of the Nineteenth Ohio Infantry submitted a report which detailed the actions of his regiment during the Battle of Shiloh two days earlier. Beatty’s regiment of volunteers had crossed the Tennessee River at midnight the previous night, after the surprise Confederate attack on 6 April had nearly overwhelmed Grant’s force at Pittsburg Landing. Beatty’s regiment was a part of Major General Buell’s force, which provided major reinforcements for General Grant’s dilapidated army and helped turn the tide of battle during the second day into a clear Union victory.","Col. Beatty was straightforward in his report, but was also anxious to emphasize that he and his men took an active role in the battle itself. After being organized and then re-organized by different commanding officers, Beatty sent two different sets of skirmishers out to engage Confederate forces, capture prisoners, and gain knowledge of the enemy position. Eventually, the entire regiment advanced along with a larger Union force that “remained at the brow of the hill under an artillery fire,” and finally ended up advancing “under fire of musketry, by which several were wounded, and delivered well-directed volleys with apparent effect, and then fell back halfway up the hill.”  As the confederate forces fell back on 7 April, Beatty’s force was not ordered to advance any further, and remained encamped on the battlefield for the next few days.","This report outlines what is perhaps the most critical moment at Shiloh: the Union Army’s utilization of the night to regroup, reorganize, and ultimately reverse the fate of the battle. Buell’s army helped Grant and Sherman’s forces recover from the massive death toll of the first day of fighting. It was this turn of events that seriously affected subsequent events on the western theatre and memories of war. Sherman became convinced that only “total war,” focusing on economic interests as well as armies, could effectively defeat the Confederacy. Also, Grant was able to prove his worth as a general by standing firm in his last lines of defense (thus securing permanent control over Western Tennessee) before fresh troops from Buell arrived in the night. Finally, the widespread carnage at Shiloh forced a restructuring of historical memory; artists’ depictions gradually became more realistic, the death of one single person lost some of its significance in the face of the 24,000 lost within the two days of battle. Thankfully, Beatty’s report shows that in spite of the carnage he was still keenly aware of the loss of every one of his men, some 4 dead, 44 wounded, and 8 missing.","Samuel Beatty had raised his regiment of volunteers from his home in Stark County, Ohio. After serving as his regiment’s elected Colonel at Shiloh, he was promoted to brigadier general and took part in several major battles in the western theatre of the Civil War. At the time when Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Beatty was being considered for promotion to major general. After the end of the war, he returned home to his farm in Ohio and lived peacefully for the rest of his life."," "],"display_date":"April 9, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-09","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4720,"title":"<strong>Confederate Disorganization Leads to Chaos at Shiloh</strong>","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-06","end_date":"1862-04-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the battle of Shiloh, Colonel Issac L. Dunlop discovered that even the clearest laid plans and troop organization can be turned into complete chaos after the start of battle.  According to the Official Reports of the battle, Colonel Isaac L. Dunlop and his Ninth Arkansas Infantry are clearly put under the command of Brigadier General J.C. Breckinridge in the Reserve Corps, to the east of the battlefield. However, Col. Dunlop’s regiment somehow managed to get in the dead center of the battle within the first day on 6 April, 1862. General A.S. Johnston found them and ordered them into battle, specifically to charge up a hill and force the Union soldiers to give up their position. Dunlop stated that he learned afterward that the men they faced were Pickett’s, but whether or not his regiment was partially responsible for the taking of the famed “Hornet’s Nest,” no one knows. They continued pursuing the Union soldiers until their position became one of “extreme peril” that was right in between “two batteries, both pouring grape and canister into [the] ranks” and then fell back to a safe position for the night.","Further organizational confusion was apparent the following morning, 7 April, when Dunlop and his men were pulled from battle in the face of a Union advance and ordered to support General J. K. Jackson and make a stand.  However, the brigade fell before Dunlop could get into position, and chaos began to rule the day; Dunlop’s regiment advanced too far forward and became completely detached from General Jackson’s Brigade, becoming “exposed to a destructive fire from both flanks.”  Rather than rejoining Jackson, Dunlop chose instead to continue moving his men in the same direction and joined up with a different brigade, this one commanded by Col. John D. Martin.  In spite of numerous attempts to make a stand and hold their position, ultimately the order to fall back was given.","Dunlop, in typical Confederate fashion, made little mention of the defeat. Instead, he emphasized in his report the bravery of his regiment, their perseverance in battle, and their tireless dedication to confronting the enemy. He gave little indication that the battle was going against them when the order came to fall back at 3 pm on 7 April, and then returned to commending the bravery of the fallen and giving numerical information to his commanding officer, J. S. Bowen.","Victor Davis Hanson, in Ripples of Battle, describes the Confederate force at Shiloh as a “microcosm of the Confederacy” that was rife with disorganization, confusion, and disunion. Other authors, such as  Brooks Simpson and Ned Bradford, definitely agree with the portrayal of confusion and chaos, though they diverge on other subjects. General A.S. Johnston provided clear and charismatic leadership, but Col. Dunlop’s report clearly indicates that without such a strong leader the Confederate forces barely managed a semi-organized retreat. With the loss at Shiloh, as well as the loss of Johnston, the western theatre had little hope of Confederate success for the remaining three years."],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 14, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-10","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4721,"title":"Shiloh: Col.

Cyprus Hall and the 14th Illinois Infantry did not mean much. According to his report of the battle one would think differently. In his account of the battle he describes, move-by-move, the chronology of the actions his men took and what they witnessed. Many of Hall’s descriptions of battle fail to give any recognition to the events of the rest of the battle, much less the Civil War. At first, Hall describes many of his actions as if he does not know what is going on around him but rather that he is just awaiting orders: “I ordered my men to lie down, conceal themselves as much as possible, and await orders”. Hall was even forced to cease fire when he was not sure whom he was firing on. It is a popular belief that the brigade commanders were only giving the power to carry out orders. On the contrary, because of the vast landscape of most battlefields and the resulting slow communication, many officers were charged with the responsibility to both carry out orders and to adapt to the events of battle without putting the army at a disadvantage: “General Grant ordered me to advance, feel my way cautiously, and engage the enemy wherever I might find him”. As the report goes on, Hall is able to acknowledge his surrounding much better than before. He was able to regurgitate every other brigade’s position around him and what he believed to be the positions of the enemy soldiers. While he did not have a true grasp on what was happening in the battle as a whole, he did understand his own positioning and the responsibilities that came with it.","It is interesting at the same time to notice that while he did not seem to mention the purpose of the battle or even the Civil War, he did recognize as many killed and wounded soldiers as he could. He mentioned the bravery of many of his Captains saying that they “were all wounded on Sunday morning, while bravely and gallantly leading and encouraging their men.” Col.

Shiloh is just a normal battle to the men fighting. The importance of the battle was only understood by those leading the war effort. An Ohio native who studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1837, Col. Ralph P. Buckland, 72nd Ohio Infantry, Commanding Fourth Brigade wrote a report his battle accounts from the battle of Pittsburg Landing (the northern name for Shiloh) to higher authority on April 9, 1862. Buckland, like many other Federal commanding officers, did not know the lay of the land of west Tennessee very well, nor did he have any pre-Civil War combat experience or training. He described his first encounter of the battle as if it came out of nowhere. He wrote, “We had marched about 30 to 40 rods when we discovered the enemy, and open fire upon him along the whole line…” Although he seemed to be unsure of his own positioning and the positioning of the enemy, Buckland’s report comes off as very confident and calm. He talks of the successes of his men during the battle writing that “I think I may safely put the number killed by my brigade in that action at 200.”<br /> <br /> Buckland's account of the battle never mentions the broad scheme of the battle or his opinion of the war. It only really talks about the events that are affecting him directly (i.e. the fighting for life and death of he and his men). This lack of opinion can be partly attributed to the intent of the report to be merely a factual account of events and casualties for the use of higher ranked commanding officers. One can also notice Buckland’s feeling of personal responsibility to recognize the dead and wounded in his ranks by describing the extent to which his men, alive, wounded and dead, were brave and fought for their country. Buckland even gives credit to the surgeons working the field for the Federal army saying, “I take the liberty to refer to the important services of Surg. J. B. Rice and the assistant surgeons of the 48th, 17th and 72 Regiments Ohio Volunteers. They labored…taking no sleep for two days and nights.\"<br /> <br /> Following the war, Buckland was elected to the thirty-ninth and fortieth Congresses as a Republican.

More often, than not, these men are not the ones who make the history books. Small unit combat is not something that we often associate with the Civil War. Often our images are of masses of men moving at each other with flags waving and horns blowing. But this was not always the case. Often it was a few men scattered around hiding behind trees taking advantage of what cover they had firing at another group of men doing the same thing. However, according to the combat principles of the time this was to be avoided as much as possible because when this happened Civil War era communication practices and technologies made it almost impossible to retain unit cohesion and command structure. It is often thought that situations like this were more favorable to Southern troops because of their largely rural upbringing as well as the fact that most white Southern men had spent at least some time on the quasi military slave patrols. This meant that these men had worked together before in combat like situations, whether it be stalking a deer, or chasing an escaped slave, and these experiences gave them a distinct advantage over their enemies.","One good example of this comes from Second Lieutenant Kelso of the 25th Tennessee at the Battle of Petersburg. During the initial Union assaults on June 16th Lieutenant Kelso noticed a gap between his unit and an artillery battery of about one hundred yards. After the first Union charge was beaten back, Kelso organized a group of 17 men and moved them into the gap taking up cover wherever they could. Another charge came bearing down on Kelso as he was moving, His men had just gotten into position when the Northerners were within fifty yards. The Tennesseans began firing rapidly at the Union men forcing them to take cover in a ravine. While under cover the Federals began waving their handkerchiefs, Kelso ordered a ceasefire and asked them to surrender, they did not so he began to fire again. However, Kelso then adavanced with is men and took them captive. As he did this a third charge came upon his men which he was once again barely able to beat back. Despite these assaults Kelso was able to retain possession of the prisoners and their colors.","This is very interesting and important low level officer work. However, it was not supposed to happen. In civil war combat these kind of small unit actions were never part of the plan. It took a lot of bravery and leadership on Kelso’s part, who was also earlier commended for bravery at Drewey’s Bluff, to accomplish this."," ","This episode can be translated into many larger themes of the Confederacy at this stage of the war. Men who earlier would not have held positions of leadership had been thrust upon the stage. It also shows that by now most men in the Army of Northern Virginia had become veteran soldiers, used to taking the initiative and thinking in terms of the broader picture. It would be hard for us to imagine a Lieutenant in either army taking this kind of responsibility on himself at First Manassas, however, by now men had become used to dealing in death and destruction"],"display_date":"June 16, 1864 - June 18, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-17","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":323,"tag":"Petersburg"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4724,"title":"The Mishaps of Being in a Halfhearted Assault","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-15","end_date":"1864-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The battle of Petersburg is remembered as one of the most destructive of the war. <br /> Petersburg can be considered the last stand of the Army of Northern Virginia. After months of maneuvering and fighting, Grant had finally forced Lee into defending Richmond itself. Before this the campaign had consisted of Lee moving to block Grant’s advances, trading ground for time. Now there was no more ground left. Lee and the Southerners would be forced to fight it out with Grant where his much more numerous and much better supplied army could only ultimately win.","The 29th Massachusetts was one of the units involved in the heavy fighting, especially early in the campaign. People often forget that the first couple of days of fighting consisted of a lot of movement and rapid advances as Beauregard scrambled to meet and check the Union advances. The 29th crossed the James late on the night of the June 15th. On the afternoon of the 17th they assaulted the Confederate works which they were able to take control of, however by 10 p.m. they were forced to retreat because of lack of ammunition. They were then put in the trenches until the 30th of July when they were involved in another assault against the Confederate works. They were able to capture a fort however they were forced to retreat this time as well. During this fighting their brigade suffered very heavy casualties. Just a week before the last attack their colonel was relieved of his duties. Then during the attack their commanding general was taken captive, this meant that in one week the command had been moved to 3rd in charge. Meanwhile another Massachusetts unit in their brigade, the 57th, was being commanded by a lieutenant and an enlisted man. In fact in his report, Lt. Colonel Barnes apoligizes for its tardiness due to the many different changes in brigade and regimental command. This helps to show some of the confusion that can occur when just a few people are wounded, go missing, or are killed. The death of one low ranking general could leave thousands of men ineffective and leaderless."," ","This pattern shows a lot about the battle of Petersburg. Initial Union assaults had the possibility of carrying the day, but the Union high command was loath to commit the numbers or power needed to complete victory. There have been several theories put forth for this lack of elan. One is that the Army of Northern Virginia and Robert E. Lee had achieved a near mythic status in the mind's of the Army of the Potomac. Some Union soldiers thought that no matter what they did, no matter how many they outnumbered them by the men in grey would find a way to win. While this may have been true earlier in the war I think that this had been dispeled by then. The Union armies had taken all that the Confederates could throw at them at Gettysburg and had held fast. However, the other theory holds more traction. This was the belief in the \"Cold Harbor\" syndrome. At Cold Harbor the North launched several massive assaults on prepared positions and had suffered horrendous casualties as a result.

Major George W. Mathieson, commander of the 31st Alabama Infantry, unleashed this “hell” upon Union assaulters even though he never took the time to describe it that vividly. Mathieson’s Alabama men were placed just south of the Railroad Redoubt as part of a concentrated defense given the task of holding the crucial path into Vicksburg.","Since the dawn of 1863, Grant focused on dislodging the Confederate railroads centered in Jackson, Mississippi. With this as the Union’s goal, Grant began the conquest of Mississippi by capturing Port Gibson and subsequently Jackson. Upon destroying the railroad hub there, Grant’s soldiers marched directly west along the Southern Mississippi Railroad. The Confederate Army had already lost control of the Mississippi River so losing this railroad would completely cut its western forces off from supplies and reinforcements. To prevent this from happening, Pemberton amassed a large Confederate force on the railroad.","It is on this railroad that Union soldiers led by General McClernand first attacked on May 19, 1863. The 31st Alabama Infantry, supported by two other Alabama units, kept the Union’s advances at bay by sustaining a slow but consistent barrage of fire, making sure that “no Abolitionist could show his head without danger from ball or buckshot.” Mathieson’s regiment had only lost one man and had killed roughly one-hundred and fifty. Following this onslaught, Grant began the siege of Vicksburg and on July 4, 1863 Pemberton surrendered.","Vicksburg had been labeled as the “nail head that holds the South’s two halves together” by the President of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis. He was justified in saying this because with complete control of the Mississippi River, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas were effectively separated from the rest of the Confederate States of America. The western states could no longer provide vital supply to the east, rendering the west almost useless from a military standpoint.","The events of the summer of 1863 also affected how the Confederacy’s population viewed the Civil War. The Confederate surrender at Vicksburg, in addition to the loss at Gettysburg, caused many southerners to doubt the Confederacy’s chances at gaining independence. Citizens of the Confederacy were discouraged by soldiers’ stories of the siege and southern hopes began to fade.

While most of the bloodshed initially took place on the eastern side of the city, Confederate artillery along the Mississippi engaged Union naval ships and heavy weaponry in an effort to protect the center of Vicksburg from an ever threatening invasion.","Colonel Edward Higgins, the commander of Vicksburg’s river batteries, was effective at repelling the Union assault of Vicksburg from late May through the first week of June. His well-placed batteries sunk the <em>Cincinnati</em> and held off the other three Union ironclads. The situation of the battle changed on June 11 when federal troops began to establish fortifications across the Mississippi River. The Union fortifications featured more cover and protection for its soldiers, making them less of a target than the rebels atop the barren banks of eastern shore. These new positions gave the Union the comfort of having both accurate artillery and constant naval support, a substantial advantage in the already close battle.","Due to the availability of Union supply, forces on the De Soto Peninsula wielded two-hundred and seventy five cannons, a few of which were high caliber Parrott guns supplied by the US Navy. In contrast, Confederates had a hundred less cannons and this number consistently decreased due to the need for artillery on the eastern side of Vicksburg. Additionally, Confederate batteries lacked sufficient ammunition to combat Union cannons backed by an “inexhaustible” supply. The significance of the Confederate Army’s shortcomings became greater as the siege worn on and Union “superiority grew into dominance.”","After over five weeks of isolation and bombardment, Confederate commander J.C. Pemberton surrendered because he knew his men lacked the strength to fight any longer. In Higgins’s report, he does not claim the fall of Vicksburg as a failure on the part of himself or his men. In fact, they had performed their duties as defenders of the Mississippi while also guarding the eastern trenches at night and serving as the city guard. He believed that had his arsenal not been down-scaled because of the “weakness of our infantry force” it would have never permitted the Union to make advances.","The shortcomings of the rebels at Battle of Vicksburg are an accurate representation of the Confederate Army as a whole.

In the early hours of April 2, the attack commenced. Lieutenant Rogers and his 100 men rushed onto the field of battle, following the advancing Union Infantry. Once the Infantry captured the Confederate guns, Rogers and his men proceeded to turn the guns on the retreating Confederates. However, the job was not as simple to fire into a retreating army. Rogers’ men had to reposition the cannon in an exposed area and operate the guns under enemy fire since they had only breached the first line of defense of Petersburg.","Lieutenant Rogers and the 100 men that were gathered for their assignment and performed their role in the battle, but did not participate in the battle after the Confederates were out of range of the artillery they operated. None-the-less, this artillery assistance provided cover for the advancing Union armies and helped soften up the Confederates while they were on their retreat. Rogers’ orders were unique in that Rogers and a detail of men were pulled from their normal units to perform a specific task. The men had not worked together before because Rogers says, “A list of the killed and wounded I am unable to give, as I am unacquainted with the names of those injured.” At this point in time, troops spent a good deal of time training with their units to create cohesion with the soldiers, which was important for success on the battlefield. This special assignment did not follow the normal protocol, and cohesion would be limited at best. None-the-less, this atypical assignment proved to be very fruitful for the Union troops.","The role of Lieutenant Rogers and the 100 artillerymen in battle was part of an important offensive on April 2 that ended the siege of Petersburg. While Lieutenant Rogers did not participate in the fighting after his assignment was completed, the Union troops drove the Confederates out of Petersburg, back to Appomattox where the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered.

The 116th Regiment was fully organized on July 12, 1864, so Colonel Woodward was with the 116th from its formation.","Colonel Woodward’s troops were involved in the siege of Petersburg from October 23, 1864 to April 2, 1865. Specifically, they were a part of the major charge that took place at 4:00 a.m. on April 2 to drive the Confederate forces from Petersburg, and then followed the retreating Confederates to Appomattox. They were also a part of taking Fort Gregg (on April 2), where they supported an artillery barrage led by the 31st Regiment. Woodward said of the troops’ actions at Fort Gregg, “This regiment, although exposed to the enemy’s fire of solid shot, took their position with the greatest coolness.”","Despite being in this great battle that finally subdued the Army of Northern Virginia, the 116th Regiment never seemed to be in the forefront of the battle, but primarily relieved troops and provided support for battle instead of being part of strategic maneuvers. This was true of most black troops at the time, because popular opinion held that black soldiers would not be able to fight effectively in battle, even after African American soldiers had performed well in previous battles. In spite of this, the black soldiers wanted to prove themselves, and the only way to do so was on the battlefield. Based on Colonel Woodward’s report, the 116th Regiment did prove themselves. Colonel Woodward ends his battle report by praising his officers, regimental commanders, and enlisted soldiers, saying that he would like to commend “the good conduct generally of the enlisted men of the command, during a period of severe marching, and reduction of rations, amounting to almost absolute destitution.”","The 116th U S Colored Troops were exposed to a variety of aspects of the war in a short amount of time, specifically militarily and socially. African-American soldiers in the Civil War faced many different forms of racism and ill treatment. Apart from being paid less, they were often assigned “fatigue duty” or “military labor,” and were put to use doing manual labor like digging trenches. This support work was often the predominant use of African American troops, and many regiments of Colored Troops were often not engaged fighting. The 116th Regiment was put on fatigue duty and experienced injustices, but they were also engaged in a major battle during the siege of Petersburg. The experience of war for the 116th Regiment and Colonel Woodward was not solely based in the military, but also had deep social and cultural experiences that were unique to African Americans."],"display_date":"April 2, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-02","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":303,"tag":"Battle of Petersburg"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4735,"title":"Col.

Moore included this in the beginning of his report on the first day of the Battle of Shiloh. Tired, hungry, and lacking supplies, the Second Texas Infantry left Texas, met with the rest of the Army of Mississippi and then traveled to Tennessee for the Battle of Shiloh within a three month time period. The Second Texas Infantry was a rather new infantry. It had only been together for less than six months when it joined the Army of Mississippi and fought against the Union troops.","Despite the hardships that they faced, the Second Texas Infantry “moved forward with light hearts and buoyant spirits without a murmur of complaint” toward the Battle of Shiloh. Imagine not only entering the war tired and hungry, but with a lack of proper clothing. Although Moore stated in his report that all of his men refrained from complaining, in reality this is not plausible, but it does illustrate the leaders tendency to paint their men in the best light possible.  As Moore stated in his report, many of the men, officers included, returned from the war barefoot because the lack of viable shoes available. Author Tony Horwitz visited the battlefield where the Battle of Shiloh occurred and wrote about what the soldiers must have experienced that day: cold, soaking wet feet. He mentioned the coldness while wearing shoes. The soldiers were barefoot on the cold, wet ground and running and fighting, not simply walking.","In addition to these hardships, the soldiers also faced the confusion of men who were inexperienced in battle. At one point when the Second Texas Regiment was fighting the Union forces, a Federal Colonel approached them shouting “Boys, for God’s sake stop firing, you are killing your friends.” Colonel Moore stated that this Colonel was simply deceiving his men, but it still indicates the uncertainty of the fighting. Moore did not lead his men on the second day of battle, but sent in a report on his regiment in defense of their actions. In his second report on the Battle of Shiloh, he acknowledged that his men contributed to the Confederate’s loss, but he defended them by placing the blame on the “multiplicity of commands, and the consequent confusion of the men not knowing whom to obey”, illustrating both a leader’s determination to paint his men in a good light and the confusion of the battle that the inexperienced men had to endure.","Although the Confederates lost the Battle of Shiloh, The Second Texas Infantry unit was commended for its bravery by generals P.G.T. Beauregard and Dabney Maury.  Following the first day of Battle, John Moore was promoted from Colonel to Brigadier General in charge of the Second Brigade."," "],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":102,"tag":"The Battle of Shiloh"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4736,"title":"A Union Officer at the Wilderness","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-04","end_date":"1864-05-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Davis did not talk of gallantry or heroics in his Wilderness Campaign report. The Lieutenant Colonel was simply carrying out orders, and his regiment had been involved in the Union’s struggle since 1861. His 69th Pennsylvania was accustomed to the reality of war; they had fought in the most famous battles: Yorktown, Antietam and Gettysburg. However, the Wilderness was not a normal battle. It was fought in thick underbrush, and regiments were frequently separated from their divisions. There were days without battle, but there was not a moment when the soldiers felt safe. Skirmishes arose in the darkest hours of night and the brightest hours of day. The deep undergrowth was the one constant for Davis and the 69th Pennsylvania. William Davis was a common man in an uncommon situation. Nevertheless, it was his duty to protect his friends when leading them into battle. During Davis’s weeklong struggle in the wilderness, he did not have the luxury of a house or a tent. William and his comrades could only take refuge in the watchful eyes of each other. The men who had been fighting in the arduous war for three years would be tested yet again.","The 69th Pennsylvania was under the command of Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock’s 2nd Corps. On the morning of 5 May, Hancock was pressed from a counterattack by two Confederate divisions that were commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. The men continued to hold the Orange Plank Road under any circumstances because any road in the Wilderness represented a huge strategic advantage. The men of 69th would spend most of their time near the Orange Plank Road before they were forced to retreat.","William Davis recounted the night of 10 May for the veteran regiment as hours overwhelmed with exhaustion. “I sent my adjutant to find out where my brigade was. He returned after an unsuccessful search. It being now dark, and the men exhausted from fatigue and want of food, I remained here for the night.” The Battle of the Wilderness would be the starting point of Grant’s campaign for Richmond.

L. Krick, in \"Longstreet's Flank Attack.\"  As Robert E. L. Krick put it, “When the attack hit, McAllister wrested his brigade through a maneuver that changed its front almost ninety degrees to face the onslaught.  That merely exposed both his flanks to overlapping southerners and barely dented the momentum of the attack. Panic spread through Mott’s entire force with increasing urgency.”  Krick’s recounting of the incident contradicts the account given by Schnoonover in that Krick characterizes the fighting in that area as chaotic and confusing, whereas Schnoonover made the whole retreat out to be a well organized withdrawal.  While undoubtedly, many of Schnoonover's men fought courageously in keeping with his orders, it is difficult to imagine that a few men were not caught up in the panic sweeping the Union forces.  Schnoonover probably omitted such incidents in his report so as to not give his unit a reputation for retreating in the face of danger.  Such a reputation would eventually fall back on him, which would not help with advancement or promotions in the future.  Whatever the reasons for the differences in the accounts, the regiment was forced to fall back due to an attack that used the terrain to its advantage.  In both versions, Lee’s gamble paid off, as the Confederates were able to use the Wilderness to downplay the strengths of the Federal units and strike a critical blow on their forces.     ","   Lee chose the Wilderness of Spotsylvania as his battlefield because Grant had 102,000 men to his 61,000 and had a decided advantage in artillery and cavalry.  The Wilderness would counter these imbalances.  The Wilderness was about seventy square miles of what had once been farmland.  After thirty years of no one tending the land, nature had reclaimed the land.  The whole area was \"a region of dense second-growth woods,\" with a dense layer of scrubby brush growing beneath the canopies of the trees.  This made marching very difficult.  “With the regiments on the right and left crowding, and in the midst of an almost impassable underbrush, it was found impossible to form a line of battle in the space I occupied on the road.”  Visibility was sometimes limited to twenty yards or less.  Such terrain would negate Grants advantage in artillery and cavalry and would make unit cohesion very difficult, giving the Confederates, who already occupied key roads and other important elements of the battlefield, an advantage.  In the case of the flank attack on the Union lines, it was an advantage pressed to its fullest potential."," "],"display_date":"May 5, 1864 -

Rhea said in The Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-6, 1864 “From the rebel perspective, the Wilderness offered an ideal battlefield. Meade’s imposing artillery and cavalry would be hobbled, and the Federals would have difficulty bringing their numbers to bear.  Accosting Meade in the Wilderness made eminent sense as a southern objective.”  In other words, if Lee could lure the Federals into the Wilderness, he had a much better chance of winning the battle."," "],"display_date":"May 5, 1864 - May 6, 1864","search_date":"1864-05-05","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":331,"tag":"Battle of Wilderness"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4749,"title":"Chaplain Lorenzo Barber: 'The Fighting Parson'","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-12-09","end_date":"1864-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In his report dated December 16, 1864, Chaplain Lorenzo Barber’s brigade had just finished what he called the destruction of “one of the most important railroads in the so-called Confederacy.”  But even with his reputation as “one of the best shots in the army” and the nickname of “The Fighting Parson,” Barber revealed the inner struggle he felt as a minister and a soldier when he shared his conflicting emotions over the events he witnessed.","As a marksman, Barber was originally recruited by the elite 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters. In response to the belief by some \"concerned Northerners\" that the South was superior in its infantry and cavalry, an article was published in the May 30, 1861 New York Times to recruit skilled marksmen.  It read, “No application will be considered in which the average of ten consecutive shots exceeds five inches from the centre of target to the centre of the ball at two hundred yards” - only the best should apply.  And so the 1st and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters were born.","Known as Berdan’s Sharpshooters after their organizer, Col. Hiram Berdan, these men brought new weapons and a new way of doing battle to the military, replacing the rifled musket with a more accurate target rifle.  An unfortunate byproduct of this accuracy meant that sharpshooters also became targets for the enemy – and Barber became one of the statistics.  In the Battle of Chancellorsville, he suffered a severe leg wound in the midst of musket fire during the Mine Run attack on November 30, 1863.  According to author Gerald Earley, “Barber’s career as a chaplain/sniper, and one of the best shots in the army, was finished.”  Charles Augustus Stevens wrote that after Barber's injury, he \"never failed to have a large audience when he officiated as preacher.  As the boys expressed it: 'That chaplain practices what he preaches.  He tells us what we should do, and goes with us to the very front to help us in battle.'\"","Barber’s injuries did not prevent him from continued service with the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters.  In his December 16, 1864 report to Brevet Major General Mott, commanding officer of the 3rd Division, 2nd Corps, Barber recounted events concerning the December 9 destruction of the Weldon Railroad.  By this time, the siege of Petersburg was in its latter stages.  The Battle of the Crater four months earlier had resulted in major casualties for the Union army, and, according to historian A. Wilson Greene, was instrumental in Grant's decision to target transportation routes.  On August 18 and 21, Union forces struck the Petersburg Railroad (also known as Weldon Railroad, which ran south from Richmond to Weldon, N.C.) and emerged victorious.  It is not clear why Barber's regiment received orders in December to destroy additional portions of the Weldon Railroad, because, according to historian James McPherson, Southern railroads were already inferior to those in the North, primarily because there were no uniform standards of operation.","But on December 7, 1864, the 5th and 2nd Corps of the U.S. Army’s 3rd Division were called to finish off the railroad's destruction.  Describing in detail the performance of his brigade, Barber explained how they lifted up the rails “as if by magic” to remove the ties so they could be burned, creating heat so great that it caused the rails to curl.  Then, in the next breath, he criticized the lack of compassion by the brigade commanders, saying they “facetiously called the portion of road assigned them to destroy ‘their contract.’”  Commenting further on the aftermath of the railroad destruction, Barber summed up his feelings, and those who go to war: “The sight presented by the burning road, bridges, piles of wood, and fences, was sad and grand in the extreme – a terrible comment on the waste and ravages of war.”","As Barber’s division received word from Major General Warren that they had successfully accomplished their mission and could return to camp at daylight, they were joined by groups of “colored people,” likely freed slaves looking for food and shelter.  It is hard to say what kind of effect this had on Barber’s division, since he did not address that in his report.  But as historian Chandra Manning documents, there was often a strange co-existence of anti-slavery and anti-black sentiment among the Union army regarding the “place” of blacks in society.","The journey back to camp brought a renewed sense of revenge along with it as well, as Barber told of finding several of his men “murdered, stripped and mutilated by guerrillas,” and of seeing several nearby buildings that were burning.  As the march continued, so did evidence of the enemy’s carnage – and as a result, most of the buildings along the remaining miles of the march were burned in retaliation by the Union troops.","Barber joined the Union army as a skilled marksman, only to leave as a wounded colonel who had witnessed enough suffering from “this cruel war” to bring out the best and the worst in his own life.  In the minds of historians, the final destruction of the Weldon Railroad would not compare to other battles in the Eastern Theater, at least not statistically.  But to Chaplain Lorenzo Barber, the “Fighting Parson,” this victory “in the frost and snow of winter and in the very face of the most powerful army of the rebellion” was worthy of recognition – for the individual men who attained it, and for the Union they were fighting to preserve."],"display_date":"December 9, 1864 - December 12, 1864","search_date":"1864-12-10","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":338,"tag":"Petersburg campaign"},{"id":337,"tag":"Weldon Railroad"},{"id":336,"tag":"Sharpshooters"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4750,"title":"All Quiet on the Petersburg Front ...

Hagood, commander of the First South Carolina Infantry, skirmishes continued even during “quiet” times and often proved deadly.","Historian A. Wilson Greene points out that Grant’s next strategy, following the Union’s mass casualties at the Battle of the Crater, was to target the transportation routes into Petersburg, cutting off the critical supply line of Weldon Railroad and exploiting the “weakened and divided Army of Northern Virginia” in August of 1864.  Hagood’s regiment arrived in Petersburg on August 23, and kept themselves busy “throwing up field-works in its vicinity” until September 28, when Grant went on the offensive once again and ordered Union forces to attack Fort Harrison – also known as “Battery Harrison.”","The strongest fort on the Richmond-Petersburg line, Fort Harrison was overtaken by Union troops on September 29, in spite of a “personally organized” campaign by Lee to regain Confederate control of the fort.  According to Hagood’s report in <em>The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies</em>, Confederate forces made preparations on September 30 to regain Fort Harrison.  Historian Richard J. Sommers writes that Lee’s foot soldiers were his only hope in recapturing the fort, and a plan to converge regiments from Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina was put into play.","As another regiment ran toward the confrontation, Hagood noted that this was a waste of energy that could have been saved for the more important “struggle on the parapet.”  He wanted the record to show he was not in agreement with this decision, but “believing it to be an order, [he] acquiesced.”  What Hagood did not realize at the time was that Confederate commander “Tige” Anderson had failed to explain the plan to his men, and once the Georgia regiment charged forward, it was too late for the South Carolinians to get into position.  “Timing and tactical skill” were crucial to the success of this plan, reportedly devised by Lee, and one without the other resulted in chaos.","The Union forces opened fire, and, according to Hagood, what followed was mass confusion – as one brigade “gave way, and rushing through our line caused immediate confusion.”  Many of Hagood’s brigade had already abandoned the battle, leaving only a few men who remained with him as he moved within 60 yards of the fort.  After waiting 10 to 15 minutes for reinforcements that never arrived, Hagood decided his only remaining choice was to “fall back.”  Frank Mixson, a private in Company E of Hagood’s 1st South Carolina Volunteers, stated that Hagood returned to the open field to retrieve his regiment’s colors from the clenched hand of a dead fellow soldier, making such an impression on the Yankees that they did not fire on him “while he was doing this gallant deed.”  Hagood later received orders to “advance again on the enemy,” but upon executing the command, he found there was no enemy.  On October 7, however, Hagood’s regiment made a daybreak attack on Union forces “on the Darbytown Pass and drove [them] from the line of works.”","Hagood’s report revealed that he was often frustrated by what he perceived as lack of rational explanation for decisions sent down to his brigade.  On the October 7 charge, his orders were to move on the enemy’s artillery, which he did.  But after a “long delay, which has never been explained” to him, Hagood and his men re-engaged Federal troops, who by now had reinforcements and were able to fight back.  Hagood’s men eventually withdrew, losing all the ground they had gained that morning, but on November 27 they drove back Federal troops on Williamsburg Road and captured “30 or 40” as prisoners.  On December 9, Hagood moved his men down Darbytown Road to the enemy’s position, and “after considerable maneuvering (for which purpose and with what effect I [Hagood] have been unable to learn),” the brigade “withdrew in the night and returned to camp.”  Again, Hagood’s tone was one of frustration over what he believed was poor planning and use of time and resources – but being an “obedient servant,” he followed his orders.","The Union army later changed the fort’s name to Fort Burnham, after Union Brigadier General Hiram Burnham of the Sixth Maine Infantry who was killed in the attack at Chaffin’s Farm, near Richmond, on September 29.  The battle at Fort Harrison resulted in 37 deaths, 209 injured, and 19 captured or missing Confederate soldiers – nearly half of Hagood’s regiment.  Compared to major battles such as Gettysburg or Vicksburg, the fight for control of Fort Harrison seems somewhat insignificant.  But in the lives of Colonel James R. Hagood and his 572 men, it was not only significant – it was a matter of life and death, and a story that deserved to be recorded."],"display_date":"September 28, 1864 - December 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-11-03","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":338,"tag":"Petersburg campaign"},{"id":339,"tag":"Fort Harrison"},{"id":340,"tag":"Fort Burnham"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4756,"title":"19th Arkansas Infantry in the Battle of Vicksburg","course_id":34,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-18","end_date":"1863-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The colonel paused briefly before moving his troops into line to make eye contact with his superior and friend Brig.

Commanding an outstanding infantry of the Second Brigade, the Nineteenth Arkansas and Colonel Dockery commenced fighting on the May 22, 1863 against Grant’s troops who huddled in the ditches right outside the garrison of Fort Hill. The sharpshooters aimed and fired, killing many of the 3,900 Union soldiers that would die that day. Later that week, the 19th Infantry moved to the rear of the city to fill in the gap created between Major Generals’ Forney and Smith; soon finding that trenches were desperately needed. With their bare hands, the entirety of the infantry from Arkansas set to work, bravely digging all night to fortify their works for themselves and their fellow soldiers. The lack of supplies was unfortunately very common for the good ‘ol Confederate boys at Vicksburg, which severely weakened their morale.","Baldwin’s Ferry Road would be the site of the next bloody encounter with the enemy, and the Confederate army fought back the enemy Union army with mere bites of mule meat in their stomachs. The Infantry was hit time and time again with shells flying from the enemy war ships on the Mississippi River, and Brigadier General Martin Green fell in combat on the 25th of May, shot directly through the head. The 19th Infantry, devastated from the loss of their beloved General, looked to Colonel Thomas P. Dockery for leadership, which was a lot of pressure for a young Colonel. The Infantry fought every day through June losing dozens of men in the process, and the ache of war was felt in their bellies and in their hearts.","The men’s honor was humbled as the word spread like wildfire about the caves, or Prairie Dog Villages, the civilians of the city of Vicksburg were living in.

The Vicksburg <em>Whig</em> newspaper ran for the last time on wallpaper, highlighting the Union Army’s blockade of the Confederate supply lines into the city, portraying the men walking out of the city as downcast, disheveled prisoners of war. The battle delivered a crippling blow to the morale of the Confederate soldiers and civilians as they survived on swiftly disappearing supplies, their humanity stripped from them in many ways. This was a huge defeat in the political, economic and social aspect as well because it followed a major defeat at Gettysburg, leaving the Confederate nation demoralized. But they fought bravely and held back the Union army for a time in the city of Vicksburg, weakening their forces to the North and protecting vital rail and shipping ports for the sake of their honor. ."],"display_date":"May 18, 1863 - July 4, 1863","search_date":"1863-06-10","locations":[{"id":7312,"lat":32.364480123,"lng":-90.8603381835,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":310,"tag":"Vicksburg"},{"id":348,"tag":"Colonel Thomas P.

During his stay, Sneden kept a diary of the conditions and daily monotony of the captives. Occasionally he gave up trying to write a daily account and would lump his entries together by the week as he did from April 8 to 20, in 1864. This particular week, Sneden talked about a group of Union criminals within the prison known as “The Raiders.”","Andersonville was a Confederate prison that was originally designed in early 1864 to hold 10,000 Union prisoners of war. By April, the prison population had reached its capacity and continued to increase until August. Prisoners suffered from terrible burdens caused by overcrowding. These problems included unsanitary living conditions, an insufficient amount of Confederate supplies, and disease. Along with these horrible living conditions, prisoners also had to deal with the threat of being mugged and killed by these thieves.","Sneden first encountered the Raiders in April when one of his fellow prisoners was killed. On a foggy night, the group killed a prisoner with pine clubs and subsequently robbed him of his overcoat and money. Due to the fog, the Raiders were able to escape undercover. The scoundrels kept together and continued to steal from prisoners on foggy nights."," Sneden described the Raiders as a desperate set of thieves and murderers from the Belle Island prison camp located west of Richmond, Virginia in the James River. Most of them were from the slums of the cities and originally served time in prison before they listed in the Union army. Sneden expressed discontentment in saying “…no one’s life is safe among us as long as these Raiders have their own way.” To help each other fight, members lived in groups. Sneden added that “They are given a ‘wide berth’ and no right minded prisoner will venture into their quarters knowingly, as he is sure to be robbed of everything he has if he does.”"," To counter the Raiders, prisoners organized a police force known as “The Regulators.” This group of fifty or more of the largest and strongest men used club force to keep Raiders from attacking. Twenty of the men were to move about the camp during the day while twenty-five stood at important points at night to head off and club Raiders. A certain portion of each man’s ration was to be allotted to these men in order to keep them in shape for fighting. The chief of the Regulators, “Big Pete,” was to decide the cases among prisoners and lash them with the cat-o-nine-tails when they were found guilty."],"display_date":"April 8, 1864 - April 20, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-14","locations":[{"id":2222,"lat":32.0447139452,"lng":-84.1951910375,"zoom":10,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4838,"title":"Mrs. Robert E.

Lee passed away from pneumonia while surrounded by his family at home in Lexington, Virginia. General Lee gained celebrity from his service as a general in the Confederacy during the Civil War. The pneumonia followed a stroke that had occurred two weeks earlier. Despite death looming, Lee maintained composure that he accumulated over his lifetime during his last two weeks of life. Lee’s wife, Mary Anna Custis, described her husband’s last two weeks in a letter to a dear friend.","General Lee suffered a stroke on Wednesday, September 28, 1870 after attending a meeting at his church. He returned home to have tea with his awaiting family. Mary Custis Lee remarked “You have kept us waiting a long time. Where have you been?” He did not reply. Instead, he stood as if he was about to say grace, but he did not utter a word. Lee quietly sat back down in his seat with a breath of resignation. Mrs. Lee said “That look was never to be forgotten, and I have no doubt he felt that his hour had come…”","Doctors promptly arrived to aid the ailing Lee and remained by his side over the last two weeks of his life. Mary Custis explained that, “He never smiled and rarely attempted to speak, except in his dreams, and then he wandered to those dreadful battle-fields.” At one point, Lee began to feel better. A doctor said “You must soon get out and ride your favorite gray!” referring to his horse, Traveller. The General did not reply as he closed his eyes and shook his head emphatically. He was stubborn about taking his medicine, saying once to his daughter Agnes, “It’s no use,” even though he would always take it afterwards.","In his final hours, Lee slept a great deal. It became more certain to doctors and his family that his case was hopeless. His pulse stet weak and rapid as his breathing grew heavier. Despite his tiredness, he was still able to recognize his family, and he loved having them around, greeting them with all with a gentle press to their hands. Slightly after nine o’clock on the morning of October 12, he at last sank to rest as his eyes closed to the world. The old hero had lost his final battle as a deep sigh drew across his face. “What a glorious rest was in store for him!” said Mrs. Lee.","After death, Lee’s image was still resented by some Northerners because they viewed him as a traitor for siding with the Confederacy during the Civil War. For generations of Southerners, he became a symbol of the virtues of the Old South. At Washington College in Virginia, Lee served as president and publicly deprecated violence. After his death, the college changed its name to Washington and Lee College.

Because it was the first black regiment to be organized in the North, many were watching its progress. If the regiment’s performance turned out to be noteworthy, it would be the deciding factor if blacks would be used in battle.","The regiment was formed in March 1863 after the Emancipation Proclamation and organized by the governor of Massachusetts, John A. Andrew. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw commanded the regiment, and Andrew himself handpicked the officers. Prominent blacks such as Frederick Douglass recruited the soldiers.  The men were mostly free blacks from the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania areas. The regiment was made up of five hundred men and thirteen officers.","Instead of the standard $13-a-month wage for soldiers, the colored regiment was paid $10. The regiment refused to accept the unequal pay. Ultimately, many blacks fought and died without accepting a penny from the federal government until Congress approved equal pay in 1864.","The 54<sup>th</sup> left Boston to fight for the Union on May 28, 1863. In early 1864, the regiment was moved into Florida. President Abraham Lincoln hoped to win a military victory in Florida and secure enough support to return the state into the Union. On February 7<sup>th</sup>, troops including the 54<sup>th</sup> moved towards Jacksonville. Snipers opened fire on the troop ships, and members of the 54<sup>th</sup> became the first soldiers to land of Jacksonville and proceeded to chase the snipers away from the ships.","On February 20<sup>th</sup>, the troops began moving toward Lake City in Northern Florida.

The battle did not go well for the Union soldiers, and by late afternoon it was clear that Union troops were losing.

On the morning of May 27, 1862, Governor Austin Blair of Michigan formally gave Sheridan command of the regiment.  Sheridan explained that the regiment “was run down by losses from sickness, and considerably split into factions growing out of jealousies engendered by local differences previous to organization.” The Governor hoped that young Phillip Sheridan would be able to bridge these troubles as a regular commander.","Sheridan’s first expedition with his regiment involved linking up with the Second Iowa Cavalry. They had been ordered to conduct a raid south of the Confederate base at Corinth and destroy Confederate rail connections at Booneville, Mississippi. Booneville was a main supply line for the Confederacy because it was located on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. Sheridan arrived at his regiment’s headquarters in Farmington at 8:00 P.M. and assumed command. The regiment traveled light with the intention of relying on the countryside as their main source for meat and bread. Sheridan expressed success with this decision and said “…our advent was so unexpected by the people of the region through which we passed that, supposing us to be Confederate cavalry, they often gave us all they had…”","Before reaching Booneville, the brigade encountered only scattered resistance that quickly dispersed. Finally, on May 29, the regiments successfully occupied Booneville. Sheridan’s regiments set to work “tearing up the track, bending the rails, and burning the cross-ties.” The destruction of this portion of railroad track successfully cut off communications with the south.","<br />Trains from Corinth soon began to pile up at Booneville. The cargo onboard the railcars was crucial to the Confederacy. “We burned twenty-six cars containing ten thousand stand of small arms, three pieces of artillery, a great quantity of clothing, a heavy supply of ammunition, and the personal baggage of General Leonidas Polk,” Sheridan stated. A large number of sick prisoners were also taken, but they were released. It was beneficial to the Union to leave the prisoners behind because they would be a burden to deal with due to the fact that of they were sick. The additional 500 prisoners would have also slowed down the regiments in their return back to Farmington.","Phillip Sheridan continued to rise in performance and rank throughout the Civil War. Governor Blair took notice of him and decided to nominate Sheridan as the commanding general of the United States Army in 1884.  His choice proved to be a very smart decision because Sheridan amassed such outstanding generalship qualities until his death in 1888."],"display_date":"May 27, 1862 - May 29, 1862","search_date":"1862-05-28","locations":[{"id":7295,"lat":34.7510332938,"lng":-88.4242992499,"zoom":9,"place":"TISHOMINGO, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":515,"tag":"Phillip Sheridan"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4897,"title":"Union Colonel Withstands Retreat at Bull Run","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-07-21","end_date":"1861-07-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Union Colonel Robert McAllister participated in the Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia on July 21, 1861.  McAllister and the 1<sup>st</sup> New Jersey volunteers were instructed to act as a rear guard at the town of Centreville for General Irvin McDowell’s routed force. The Battle of Bull Run was the first major battle of the Civil War. After the arrival of Confederate reinforcements, Union soldiers began fleeing back to Washington. McAllister recalled the retreat during the disorganized battle in a letter to a friend.","After the artillery ceased fire, McAllister saw masses of confused Union soldiers retreating past his position at Centreville. Part of the confusion was due to the fact that the Virginians were all wearing blue, so Union gunners did not fire on them. After ordering the retreating soldiers to turn around, he ordered his men to pull out their bayonets and march through the withdrawing columns of soldiers. “We drew our swords and pistols on men and officers who would not willingly turn back,” explained the General.  Earlier, McAllister had received specific orders from McDowell to make a stand at his position at Centreville.","Suddenly, a pale civilian rode by his troops at a fast pace. McAllister ordered the civilian to halt and explained that his specific orders were to stop everybody fleeing. The frightened civilian said, “I am a bearer of dispatches to Washington and must pass.” McAllister denied examining his papers and directed him to his commander, Colonel James Montgomery. Montgomery allowed the civilian to pass after expressing his disgust to his cowardice. McAllister learned later that this man was actually the correspondent for the <em>London Times</em>. ","McAllister continued to push his troops through the throng of retreating soldiers until he reached a hill past Centreville. As night set in, his orders remained unclear. His men had fallen asleep but eventually were awoken by the sounds of neighboring troops retreating. McAllister refused to leave until he was informed that he had to retreat. ","After the battle, McAllister praised his regiment for providing security for those who were retreating. “We saved the Government a large amount of property,” he said after explaining that they provided time for the soldiers behind them to save wagons of supplies that were parked along the road. Although many claimed credit for protecting the retreat and being the last to leave the field, McAllister said, “We were the very last to leave Centreville.”","The Battle of Bull Run showed both the Union and the Confederacy that the Civil War was going to be far longer and bloodier than it was originally anticipated. Both Northerners and Southerners had romanticized the war before it began. McAllister’s letter is proof of the lack of training, communication, and organization that occurred during the battle. After the battle, new leadership and better training would help prepare Union troops for sustained action in the field.  "],"display_date":"July 21, 1861","search_date":"1861-07-21","locations":[{"id":14189,"lat":38.5089863052,"lng":-77.2972733849,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE WILLIAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":516,"tag":"Battle of Bull Run"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4900,"title":"African American servicemen in the Civil War","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-05-01","end_date":"1862-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letter, U.S., let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, there is no power on earth that can deny he has earned the right to citizenship.”","--Frederick Douglass"," ","In books around the world, conventional history teaches that the American Civil War and black slavery are inextricably intertwined. While it is common knowledge that slavery and its spread lead to the conflict; the actual role of African Americans during the Civil War remains widely unexplored. In mid 1861, as news of the war spread, many free black men set out to enlist to join the effort. However, they were not permitted to do so, with officials citing a law from 1792 banning African Americans from the military, and a fear of border-state secession.2 A year into the war, the Union Army was in desperate need of more volunteers. In response, a provision of President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation allowed black men to serve in the U.S. Army. Black regiments from Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Tennessee began to pop up, but not until influential civil leader Frederick Douglass promoted the cause did enlistment intensify.2 Douglass’ call for citizenship through service proved effective. About 200,000 black men served in the Army and Navy during the war, and black women like the notable Harriet Tubman played key roles as well.2  This article from The New York Daily Tribune from March of 1864 provides a first hand glimpse into what life was like for two of these black regiments right here in Central Florida. African Americans fought valiantly in the Civil War; enduring both the horrors of war and widespread discrimination towards them."," ","Despite the fact the African Americans fought alongside the white soldiers of the Union Army, they still faced significant racial intolerance from them. Racism was still firmly ingrained in the minds of many Americans even in the North. The units of soldiers were segregated, often with a white officer commanding an all black regiment. The black soldiers were typically given duties white soldiers refused to perform. In addition, black soldiers were not granted the same wages that their white counterparts received. While white soldiers received $13 per month, enlisted black men only received $10, with an extra $3 deducted for clothing costs. 2 Also, racism made the prospect of being caught as a prisoner of war far worse for a black soldier. Captured black soldiers routinely faced harsher punishment than whites, and sometimes were even brutally executed, which was the case at the 1864 massacre at Fort Pillow, Tennessee.2 Despite many racial obstacles, black soldiers fought with valor in pursuit of freedom."," ","Of the many examples of black courage and valor fighting in the Civil War, the bravery shown at Battle of Olustee in Lake City, Florida stands out as a local Florida milestone. In the spring of 1862, Union Brigadier General Truman Seymour was leading a band of some 5,000 men on raids throughout North and Central Florida, freeing slaves, and attempting to destroy Confederate trade routes.3 Seymour experienced relative success, only needing to engage small bands of militiamen. Without approval from his superiors, Seymour marched his troops further north, where eventually he and his troops ran into a large Confederate brigade commanded by General Joseph Finegan. General Seymour made the fatal error of assuming that he was once again up against a small, inexperienced militia. Relentless cannon blasts and rifle fire inflicted serious damages on the Union troops. The Confederate forces prepared for an offensive charge, and Seymour needed a miracle. Just then, the heroic black reinforcements arrived. An eyewitness explains, “They came at double quick. The 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts went in first, with a cheer… followed by the 1<sup>st</sup> North Carolina… and charged upon the rebels.”1 The volunteer regiments engaged the Confederates, stopped the charge, and despite casualties, “the two colored regiments had stood in the gap, and saved the army!”1 When the dust settled, “The 54<sup>th</sup> Mass., which, with the 1<sup>st</sup> N.C., may be truly said to have saved the forces from utter rout, lost about 80 men wounded and 12 killed.”1 When they were called upon for duty the black soldiers responded with admirable valor and heroism."," ","This tale of a recklessly ambitious general and his men saved by black volunteers captures the essence of African American involvement in the Civil War. Fighting alongside men who do not believe they deserve equal rights, the black infantrymen battle on regardless, striving for that citizenship Frederick Douglass so eloquently described. The brave men and women who joined in this fight for freedom built the foundation for the American Civil Rights Movement in the generations to come.","“We, the colored soldiers, have fairly won our rights by loyalty and bravery—shall we obtain them? If we are refused now, we shall demand them.”"," ","--Sergeant Major William McCeslin; 29<sup>th</sup> U.S.C.T."," "],"display_date":"May 1862","search_date":"1862-05-16","locations":[{"id":1327,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":116,"tag":"Wounded Soldiers"},{"id":365,"tag":"Emancipation"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4949,"title":"Courageous Irish Brigade","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-11-18","end_date":"1862-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       Their eager face showed no doubt or fear.

home to his mother on April 12, 1863, Assistant Surgeon to the 22<sup>nd</sup> regiment of Alabama Infantry, Matt Turner captured the sentiments of many others in the Confederate Army as he spoke of wishing to return to his home.  Turner wrote his letter from a “camp near Shelbysville Tennessee,” where he was “alone except the agreeable company of the lame, the halt and the blind who all look eagerly to me for comfort and consolation.”  As an assistant surgeon in the Confederate army, these would have been his duties, as according to the medical records from the Confederate States of America, the duties of an assistant surgeon general included looking after the sick and wounded and helping the surgeon.","As Turner looked after the lame, an air of anxiousness can be observed as he stated that “we are still at this place.  We have been anticipating a move, but since I last wrote, it seems that we are off now more than then.”  Stationed in Tennessee, Turner would not have seen many of the major battles of 1863, as the next major battles of the Civil War occurred farther north in May of 1863, in Chancellorsville.","While sitting in camp, anxious for the next move Turner aspired to return to his home.  He wrote that he was “very tired of tramping about through the mud after a regiment merely for the name at this time.”  He further spoke of his bad health, as a reason to go home “long enough to recover my health entirely before entering the service again, though this will depend very much on the circumstances.”","While Turner wanted to be relived of his position, the chances of this were probably slim.  Turner stated that he had submitted an application for a “thirty days leave of absence.”  However, Turner’s application was “returned, disapproved, by Gen. Bragg and all my hope is gone.”","While Turner may have wanted to return home, the Confederacy was in need of men.  In the spring of 1862, the Confederacy adopted a policy of conscription in order to fill the ranks of the army.  While the Confederacy had trouble filling the ranks, the problem intensified during the winter of 1862-1863 as the Confederacy experienced a high rate of desertion for

commemorate the deaths of her two young sons, David Jr., and James, Catherine Wills wore a mourning broach.  The gold broach containing one blonde and one brunette lock of hair with a black ring around it was a fairly generic piece of jewelry during the nineteenth century.  Like many others who attended the dedication of the Soldiers National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and heard Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, Wills may have worn her broach to this occasion.  The cemetery and dedication was of particular importance to the Wills family, as David Wills, the young boy’s father, had played an instrumental role in creating the cemetery.  The Wills were prominent citizens in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and Lincoln himself stayed in the Wills home.","Catherine Wills probably mourned the death of her two sons for one year, as that was the standard time length for mourning a child in the nineteenth century, according to scholar Drew Faust.  Catherine would have also been the primary mourner of the children, not only because she was the children’s mother, but because women held much of the responsibility to mourn over loved ones.","As can be observed through these standards of mourning, nineteenth century America had a strong culture of mourning.  In their final breaths, individuals sought to die willfully, at home, surrounded by family.  Family and friends were to be beside the dying in order to assess whether they had passed to Heaven, and could be united there, according to Faust.","During the Civil War, not all of these practices were feasible.  As soldiers died on battlefields, far away from home, they could not have the comfort of being surrounded by family, and family could not see a son’s, father’s, or brother’s last breaths.  Due to these constraints, soldiers had to improvise.  Some would die holding pictures, or lockets of hair of their loved ones.  In preparation of this, some soldiers would take a lock of hair from their loved ones before departing for war, and also leave a lock at home for their family.  Further, possessions of the deceased were given to the family in order to demonstrate that loved ones had died.","While this style of mourning continued for many years, it eventually faded into unpopularity.  This can be observed through Catherine Wills’ mourning broach as it was modified to have a pin to fasten it, which was not in the means of attaching the broach at the time."],"display_date":"November 19,

an effort to take revenge on the North, the ninth regiment of Alabama volunteers burned the Culp home in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, during the Gettysburg campaign.  The reasons for this destruction are dictated by the volunteers, as after they burnt the Culp home they left a short, crudely handwritten note to the owners of the property.  The note clearly indicates the intentions of the Confederate soldiers, as they wrote, “Mr. Culp your house tore up purtty [sic] bad but we will do it A good deal more.  Quit burnig [sic] up our houses turning woman and children Out of doors.”  Alabama soldiers burned the Culp home in retaliation for the destruction they had observed or heard of the Union soldiers doing in the South.","The Alabama volunteers also sought to give the Culps, as well as other Northerners a warning.  This can be observed not only in the threat to destroy the Culp property to a greater extent, but also through the signature of the letter.  The Confederates signed the letter with the statement, “Remember this when you see 9th Regiment of Alabama Volunteers.”  In other words, remember the destruction caused to your farm when you see this unit, or any unit of the Confederacy.","The destruction of the Culp home can be seen as an act of retribution for the destruction brought on the South during the Civil War and an effort to take revenge for the aggression of the North.  One of the many motivations in fighting the Civil War exhibited by Confederate soldiers was defending their home land from Yankee aggression.  As stated by scholar, James McPherson in <em>The Battle Cry of Freedom:  The Civil War Era, </em>Southerners felt the need to fight to protect their home from the Yankee soldiers who they viewed as vandals and thieves who would steal their slaves, and take their women.  As the South became the main battle ground of the Civil War, this sentiment grew more intense.  Further, the South experienced the most amount of destruction, as discussed by scholar Carl Degler.","While the Union may have inflicted great damage on Southern property, General Robert E. Lee had ordered his men refrain from doing the same to the Union in Pennsylvania, in order to show that they possessed stronger moral character than the Union soldiers.  Regardless of these orders, ruin was still brought to the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania through the burning of Thaddeus Steven’s iron works, and the destruction of railroad property as discussed by McPherson.  Money and other items were also stolen from York, as well as other towns in south-central Pennsylvania.","While great destruction occurred in the South prior to the battle of Gettysburg, the South had yet to see the worst of the havoc the Union would wreck on it.  Sherman’s March to the Sea, inflicted the greatest damage on the South, as the Union soldiers worked to destroy the South and hasten to victory."],"display_date":"July 1, 1863 - July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4981,"title":"Lincoln Demotes Burnside After Resignation Letter","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-09-17","end_date":"1863-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the aftermath of the Battle of Fredericksburg, there have been three main reasons given arguing that Ambrose Burnside should bear all of the blame.

Hummel, General Robert Edward Lee reflects on the Civil War and his role in helping heal the wounds between North and South in an attempt to mend the shattered Union.  In Lee’s own words he spoke of the South’s role in re-entering the Union, “What course I shall pursue I have not decided upon, and each man must be the judge of his own action.  We must all however resolve on one thing not to abandon our country.  Now more than at any other time, Virginia and every other state in the south needs us.  We must try and with as little delay as possible go to work to build up their prosperity.”  Lee further encouraged the south in its position toward peace with the North in stating, “To secure such a peace it was not only necessary that the south should abandon its arms, but abandon also all enmity and negative position, and accept with cheerful alacrity the changes of the time.”  Lee’s surrender at Appomattox ended the bloodiest war the U.S. has ever seen, and it is difficult to imagine that this task could have been carried out by a man with more honor and respect than General Lee. “Robert E. Lee had no bitter words for his former enemies.  By word and personal example, the general continued to lead the South—not to hatred and defiance but to reunion and reconciliation.”","                One of the most intriguing aspects of the interview was Hummel’s discussion on Lee’s indictment to the federal court of Norfolk for treason by President Andrew Johnson.  Proceedings for Lee’s indictment were stalled however due to General Grant’s demand that the charges be dropped arguing that treason charges would compromise the arrangements for surrender made at Appomattox.  Though revered by the nation after the Civil War, Robert E. Lee remained unscathed to the analyses and criticism of many historians.  In his book Lee Considered, Alan Nolan offers a different side to the Lee phenomena as if to emphasize that much of what is known about Lee has been recorded by historians and journalists biased toward the Confederate general.  Nolan offers a different approach to Lee's role in helping mend ties between north and south arguing that his role was in fact quite limited and insignificant.","Ever the gentleman, Lee earned the respect of his foes as well as the love of his officers and soldiers.  Hummel depicts a portrait of Lee in the aftermath of Appomattox by stating, “ All men admitted his high sense of honor, his unostentatious practice of all the Christian virtues, his true religious feeling, his calm endurance of untoward results, and his quiet observance of the duties of life.” "],"display_date":"April 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-09","locations":[{"id":13628,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":657,"tag":"Appamattox Court House"},{"id":656,"tag":"Robert E.

Civil War ended with feelings of both celebration and relief at the war’s end in the North, and political cartoons such as “Freedom’s immortal triumph!  Finale of the “Jeff Davis Die-nasty”  illustrated the triumphant mood pervading the Union in 1865.  The Republican bias of the image is obvious as Union President Abraham Lincoln is rising towards heaven escorted by angels, while the devil waits for Confederate President Jefferson Davis to descend into hell after being hanged.  The “Confederate Mourners” stand beneath their nooses waiting to be hanged, while John Wilkes Booth is actually rushing in to be hanged.  Liberty and Justice are also depicted in the clouds above the scene, showing their approval of the Union victory; instead of more bloodshed, Liberty and Justice represent the belief in a need for resolution and reunion.  A former slave is shown, illustrating a vision that Northerners thought that they wanted, but the Colfax Massacre of 1873 tells differently, as another fight for civil rights would have to be fought a century later.  The visualization of the hanging of Confederate leaders shows the desire for vengeance that many people in the North felt towards the South at this time.","This political cartoon shows the social disarry that was present and would continue through Restoration; it brings to light the question of the North and the South, two separate identities, would function as one unitary state.   There are Anti-Southern feelings present, as the cartoon illustrates, especially after the assassination of Lincoln with citizens seeing their former president as a martyr.  On the other hand, while Southern sentiment is not depicted here, many Southerners saw Reconstruction as an “occupation” by the Union and felt associated with the Confederacy and not the Union.  Many Southerners viewed Lincoln as a “Black Republican,” and yet others saw Lincoln as a man of forgiveness and peace regarding Reconstruction, and regretted his murder (Peterson 46).  All in all, Reconstruction saw divisions in America at the end of the war, between the North and the South, but also within the regions.  Simply ending the war would not change this.  Yet Northern hope for a successful Reconstruction was great at this time as the Union wanted to transform and improve the South; however, ten years later, many of the goals for Reconstruction failed.  The cartoon also does not depict the hundreds of thousands of Union men that died fighting for their idea of justice.  A question that arises as well is whether or not the war was truly an “end” as

the midst of the Civil War, one woman remained behind the scenes of the battlefield documenting the war and experiencing the fighting first hand.  Belle Edmondson kept a diary from January to November of 1864 in which she detailed occurrences in West Tennessee such as the Union and Confederate battles, tragic accidents of friends, visitations by friends and family, travel to various southern cities, and everyday occurrences such as meals and church.  Edmondson’s primary role during the war was that of an intelligence gatherer, courier, and contraband smuggler for the Southern troops.  Edmondson's wartime experiences occurred on land controlled by neither Union nor Confederate soldiers.","Within Edmondson’s vast collection of journal entries, she described with great detail the fighting she witnessed and her desire for the Confederates to disarm and capture the Northern forces.  As a hero of the Confederacy, she wrote on April 13 of heavy firing between Fort and Gun boats and the fifteen Union soldiers who arrived and forced Edmondson to feed their horses.  Shortly afterwards, the soldiers stole some of those horses.  Her attitude in the diary shifted on Saturday, April 16 when she wrote of the arrival of thirty Union soldiers, six of which dined over breakfast with her.  She described them as gentlemen and expressed her surprise at finding their company pleasing to dine with.","While Belle's experience with Union forces shifted from inconvenient to tolerable, Stephen Ash described in his book \"When the Yankees Came: Conflict and Chaos in the Occupied South\" that many southerners experienced \"shock, confusion [and] panic\" at the incoming Federal soldiers.  Ash explained that much of this terror, as experienced by Belle when they arrive on her property, was \"often aggravated by uncertainty about the enemy's exact location and intentions.  With communications disrupted and facts scarce, rumors flourished.\"  A native of Edmondson's home state of Tennessee, Nimrod Porter described his fear at the Union's arrival in February of 1862 when he stated, \"The awful state of affairs, and the greate uncertainty of events, & the suspense is truly almost too much for me to beare.\"  Many throughout the south lived in panic over the presence of Union forces and had to live among fear of their unknown locations.","Two days later on April 18, Edmondson received another visit from Memphis Union soldiers and expressed her disgust over one of them who was a black abolitionist, indicating Edmondson's hostility toward those enslaved.  Throughout the many issues discussed in Edmondson’s diary, her vocal expressions of racism and detailed account of the fighting express the real feelings and anger experienced by those living in south during the Civil War.  Obviously in favor of Confederate forces and vocally against the actions of the Union, toward the end of her diary, Belle wrote on August 29, 1864 of her excitement for General Lee with his victory in Virginia.  While her enthusiasm ebbs and flows with the changing actions of the soldiers on both sides, the constant hatred and corruption radiated throughout the south, and her account allows us to witness southerner’s trials and tribulations throughout the Civil War."," "],"display_date":"January

month after the vicious Battle of Gettysburg, a Confederate surgeon wrote home to his wife, explaining that the Southern soldiers had nearly won but chose to retreat instead.  Spencer Glasgow Welch’s words encompass the view of many of the Confederate army and its supporters at the time: that despite their lack of food, clothing, and decent shelter, there was hope for a victory against the Union forces. His division was directly engaged in the three days of battle ranging from July 1-3, and he described the soldiers as they approach the enemy: “I at once noticed in the countenance of all an expression of intense seriousness and solemnity, which I have always perceived in the faces of men who are about to face death and the awful shock of battle.”","Welch’s letter outlined with the precise eye of one engaged in military pursuits the various advances and retreats of the two warring sides. He recalled how he avoided death by inches countless times, probably much to the distress of his wife back home. But his words also show us a sort of disillusionment that must have pervaded the increasingly ruined Confederate side; remarking on General Robert E. Lee’s retreat from the front lines, he claimed that the man was “hoping, I suppose, that the enemy would attack him; but they didn’t dare come out of their strongholds.” Welch must have seen the death about him and known the losses his army had incurred, but managed to stay positive regardless. Even Pickett’s Charge, of which his division was a part, only gained one sentence in his commentary.","The Battle of Gettysburg is seen by many to be the true turning point of the Civil War; it was the point in which the troops of the South were dealt a decisive blow that would define many of the battles to follow. The 28,000 dead Confederates were a greater loss to the Southern army, which had difficulties recruiting more men. Welch’s letter shows us both the hope and denial that pervaded the lives of these people; in a later letter written by his own wife, she mentioned calmly that the surrender of Lee was reported but not yet confirmed. The victory of the emancipated Southern states was almost a guarantee in the citizens’ minds, and losses such as the one at Gettysburg must have been a shock they desperately wanted to avoid; Welch’s letter shows, through his suppression of the true level of death and loss at the battle, that as if by denying it, the approaching end of the Confederate States could be avoided."],"display_date":"August 2, 1863","search_date":"1863-08-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5010,"title":"Women Soldiers in the Civil War","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-03-29","end_date":"1863-03-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Union and Confederate uniforms were symbols of purpose and bravery for the soldiers who wore them, but for some they were merely a disguise. Over 4 million people fought in the Civil War, whether recruited or serving as volunteers. Among those who served were approximately 400 women disguised under male aliases. Among these 400 documented women was Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, a member of the 153rd Regiment. The entire collection of Wakeman's letters sent home while on duty survived and offers one of the best representations of war time experiences for women.","Wakeman's letter was littered with concern over money. She declared that she received $13 per month and would help pay her father's debts. There were several motivations for women to join the war efforts of the time. Some enlisted because they truly wanted to serve their country, some to stay with their husbands, some for liberation and purpose, and others for monetary reasons. It is obvious that Rosetta Wakeman's primary motivation was financial security.","In one of Wakeman's letters, she expressed her delight in receiving a letter from her family in return: \"I receive a letter from you today. I was much pleased with it.\" This delight was not solely a result of being homesick, but was also an expression of relief. It was not uncommon for families to completely dismiss daughters who dressed like men and took on such unconventional roles. The fact that Wakeman's family maintained communication with her is unexpected and; therefore, much appreciated.","In the beginning of her letter, Wakeman told her family she was \"contented\" and did not \"fear the rebel bullets.\" By the time she sent this letter, she has added at the bottom, \"When you think of me think where I am. It would make your hair stand out to be where I have been. How would you like to be in the front rank and have the rear rank load and fire their guns over you shoulder?\" This portrays the fact that women were right in the middle of battle, enduring not only the same physical challenges as men, but were also struggling with the conflict every soldier is faced with between bravery and fearful reality.","Rosetta Wakeman was not well educated, as is reflected in her grammar throughout the letters.

Often, the actions taken by Northern troops led to hostility and bitterness by southerners towards Northern troops because often the soldiers would cause destruction to civilian Property. This hostility appeared in letters written by both sides.","In May of 1861 Federal troops occupied the home of Robert E. Lee in Arlington, Virginia.  Mary Curtis Lee, the Confederate commander’s wife, was denied access to her home, along with all of her servants. In a plea to return to her home, Lee wrote to Union General Sanford.  She states “It never occurred to me Gen’l Sanford that I could be forced to sue for permission to enter my own house that such an outrage as its military occupation to the exclusion of me and my children could ever have been perpetrated by anyone in the whole extent of this country” However, the plea was ultimately denied. This occupation and then restriction of access was common in the South during the American Civil War.  This occupation of captured territory would ultimately end in bloodshed committed, not by soldiers, but by the civilian population.","As tensions began to rise in the South, Northern troops also began to write letters home describing the hostilities. One Northern officer wrote, “ You have no idea Libbie, how bitter these people are in their hatred of Yankees. They hate us all the way through.” This hatred ultimately came as a shock to Northern troops who viewed themselves as Americans. In actuality they could have been a foreign invaders those affected civilians.  Southerners generally viewed property as sacred. This view of property included not only their lands but also slaves and agricultural products.","As the Northern Army pushed deeper into the South, the civilian population grew more hostile.

Calhoun.  Each player narrated their understanding of critical events that led to the imminent drama of the sectional division among the North and South. "," ","The North and South became bitter as states divided themselves between free states and slave states.  With each section disputing over slavery and economical issues, the bitterness increased as congressional debates continued.  In Henry Clay’s story, he described one of the most important problems the North and South faced was the issue of slavery and the Missouri crisis.  This conflict resulted in the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and was the first of many attempts to resolve the issue of the expansion of slavery into new states.  Henry Clay, the “Great Compromiser”, proposed that Missouri would be admitted as a slave state and Maine as a free state.  The South opposed the admission of free states unless they were balanced by the admission of an equal number of slave states.  With Clay taking the lead with this compromise, he stated, “Yet it avoided catastrophe and earned me kudos throughout the country as a compromiser or whom Union is his motto, conciliation his maxim” (13).  Although this compromise did not solve the slavery issue, it allowed time for negotiation in order to work out a better solution. "," ","Clay’s account also described his work in the Compromise of 1850 which gathered his proposals into one “ominous bill.”  He provided that California would be admitted as a free state.  In return, the people of Utah and New Mexico could vote to determine whether they would be free or slave states.  The idea that the territories could decide the slavery issue themselves became known as popular sovereignty.  Clay also proposed that the Fugitive Slave Law would be strengthened.  This stirred up more intense arguments and disputes about slavery.  Clay explained how this compromise postponed the unavoidable conflict developing between the pro-slavery South and abolitionist North. "],"display_date":"1820 - 1845","search_date":"1832-12-31","locations":[{"id":8917,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":770,"tag":"Sectional tensions"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5015,"title":"The Conferderate Uniform was on fire!","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-05","end_date":"1862-04-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The letters written from a Confederate soldier to his “Charming Nelly” tell the stories of a Confederate regiment throughout the Civil War.  Between 1862 and 1864, J.B. Polley, the Confederate soldier, wrote 28 different letters to the same person.  Curiously, “Charming Nelly” was someone who Polley had only met three times in his life and all three meetings were very brief.  Polley joined the war effort in 1861, but his letters to “Charming Nelly” did not start until 1862 with the first letter being written from Camp Hood (the location of his Texas regiment in 1862, his regiment is better known as the Hood’s Texas Brigade).  No one knows whether these letters were actually sent to Nelly or just an excuse for Polley to write about the stories of the Civil War and his regiment.  Some say his only motive was to publish a book.  Never the less, these stories tell and reveal a great deal of unknown instances that took place on the front lines.","Entitled, “Humorous Incidents,\" Polley’s second letter (written on April 5, 1862) tells the story of Jack and Jack’s huge misfortune one night.   Jack was a fellow soldier, but rejected the ordinary uniform that the Confederate Army provided to their soldiers.  Instead, much to the disliking of his comrades, Jack decided to buy a five dollar overcoat and spent twenty-five extra dollars on the rest of his uniform.  One of the first nights out, the weather was intensely cold and Jack decided not to remove any of his garments to sleep in and also decided to wrap himself in four of his new blankets as well.  Jack fell asleep that night very comfortable, but laid too close to the fire the soldiers had built.  At about midnight, Polley recalls, Bob Murray (another fellow soldier) wakes up and smells the scent of burning clothing.  Polley says, “He had only to look once to discover that as the fire burned lower and lower, Jack had edged his black nearer and nearer to it, and at last a stray coal had lighted a flame that was playing sad havoc with his blanket and coat.”  Polley goes on to explain, in a very humorous manner, how Jack was probably the last to wake up from Murray’s screams.  It was too late, however, for his beloved uniform.  Polley explained, “altogether [the garment was] too open at the back to be comfortable, and with two pointed tails hanging in front, instead of in the rear.” After Jack tried to fix his unfixable uniform, the entire regiment starts to ask him questions and by night fall, Jack is “too hoarse to talk.”","While this story may at first seem of no historical importance, there are two main underlying things this story speaks to.  First, The story speaks to the fact that the Confederacy had constant challenges to acquire and maintain equipment.  In “A Survey of Confederate Central Government Quartermaster Issue Jackets” Leslie D. Jensen writes, “Despite some truly important work by members of the Company and others, we still remain ignorant of much of the inner workings of the Confederacy's supply system and clothing procurement practices. Perhaps, too, we are still too easily lulled by an appealing image of the ‘ragged rebel,’ and therefore naively accept the concept of ‘Johnny Reb’ being supplied indefinitely by the folks at home, conveniently ignoring the fact that no army, however resourceful, wages war very long if it doesn't develop a workable supply system.”  Jensen goes on to mention that the uniforms that were supplied to the Confederacy may not have been “fit for issue.”  This was a decisive fact in the war because the South struggled to keep up with the advances in equipment that the North had available. ","Secondly, this story reveals why the South thought they had a chance at winning the war.  For example, why would the other Confederate soldiers not like the fact that Jack had decided to go against the Confederate uniform and purchase his own?  The answer could be due to the fact that the only chance the Confederate Army had at winning the Civil War was to stay together.  The Confederacy was facing an uphill battle, but had two things going for them.  First, they were fighting on their own lands and, secondly, they were fighting for the same cause.  When writing about Polley’s brigade, the historian Charles E. Brooks said that this togetherness in the same cause gave the South a greater chance of success, slim as it was.  By buying his own uniform, Jack separated himself from the other Confederate soldiers in his regiment.  Thus, Jack was seen as not totally for the Confederate cause, something the Confederate leaders hated in their soldiers. "],"display_date":"April 5, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-05","locations":[{"id":13839,"lat":39.2038567799,"lng":-78.2606208397,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":669,"tag":"Confederate Army"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5020,"title":"Threats from a Union Leader to a Confederate Leader","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-11-11","end_date":"1864-11-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Colonel John S. Mosby of the 1<sup>st</sup> Virginia Cavalry was known as the “Grey Ghost” because of his ability to elude and disappear from his Union opponents in the Civil War.  His thoughts and memories are captured in a collection of writings that he wrote throughout the Civil War.  These writings span from his early adulthood in 1855 to the end of the Civil War in 1865. ","One letter specifically written by Mosby on November 11, 1864 to the very respected General P.H. Sheridan, of the Union, speaks specifically to the feelings and thoughts of both the Union and the Confederacy.  In this letter Mosby directly calls out General Sheridan and says, “Six of my men who had been captured by your forces, were hung and shot in the streets of Fort Royal, by order and in the immediate presence of Brigadier-General Custer.  Since then another shared a similar fate.”  Mosby then goes on to say about seven of General Sheridan’s men captured by Mosby that, “seven of your men were, by my order, executed on the Valley Pike – your highway of travel.”","Although written by a Confederate Lieutenant Colonel and soldier, this letter reveals the way the Union was thinking towards the Confederate army.  The killing of six of Mosby’s men signifies the punishment that Union armies were planning to use against some of the Confederate Soldiers.  These killings may have been due to the fact that Mosby was not respected by Union leaders because of his “hit and run” strategy of fighting.  Mosby was known for eluding and quick strikes against Union regiments.  Mosby would not stand up and fight.  The Union leaders wanted to threaten Mosby and scare him away from these “hit and run” attacks.  Not only did the Union Army not like Mosby, the Union Army would not save any of Mosby’s men as signified by a sign hung around one of the six killed soldiers that declared “that this would be the fate of Mosby and all his men.”  This would warn Mosby and the rest of his army that the Union would not stand for anything the Confederate Army would throw at them.","This letter also reveals the thoughts and treatment that the Confederate Army used during the war.  The Confederate Army would not let the Union Army bully their way to a win.  This was evident in the fact that Mosby ordered the same fate to the Union prisoners that the Union army had ordered to captured Confederate prisoners.  This worked with great success as Mosby later says, “No further ‘acts of barbarity’ were committed on my men.”  Mosby and the Confederacy were not going to lie down easily even though the Union Army vastly outnumbered them.  Thus, the Union idea that they could “bully” the South was quickly shot down."],"display_date":"November 11, 1864","search_date":"1864-11-11","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":676,"tag":"John S.

Lanneau delivered to Governor Perkins a letter signed by university President James Furman offering the state the services of the Riflemen.  It must have been a disappointment when the governor declined their offer, saying “I believe the fighting will be in Virginia and Pensacola…I do not think our young men of any college, who constitute the future of our Nation, should be marched in other states.”","The Furman students were not to be deterred, however, and Prof. Lanneau’s role in the war was only just beginning. On April 22 the University Riflemen unanimously elected Lanneau to be their captain.  In their letter informing him of the decision, the unit’s officers urged him to take the offer by arguing “By accepting the post, you will give dignity and importance to the Corps and assure our parents that we are under the supervision of one who will exercise parental care over us.”","Born in 1836 in Charleston, Lanneau graduated in 1856 first in his class from South Carolina’s military academy, the Citadel.  He then taught math, physics and chemistry at Furman.  Despite evidently not having sought out a commission, Lanneau accepted his students’ offer and began looking for a way to get them into the war.  Opportunity would not elude him for long.","On April 30 Wade Hampton, after gaining authorization from Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Governor Pickens, began recruiting the state’s social elite for an independent legion.  Hampton, one of the wealthiest planters in South Carolina, personally toured around the state to select companies for this new unit.  Lanneau wrote to Hampton on behalf of the newly rechristened Brooks Troop, and they were chosen to become one of the four cavalry companies of what would become known as the Hampton Legion.","Lanneau would be the captain of Company B of the Hampton Legion until June 1862, and his faithfully-kept notebook (actually a textbook he wrote in the margins of) preserves his memory of the time.  After his company missed the Battle of Manassas due to a lack of railcars, Lanneau arrived at the battlefield to see “unburied bodies and carcasses of horses were still there [five days later] – but strange, no carrion birds.”  Instead of battling the “Lincolnites,” he and his men fought boredom, disease (typhoid fever claimed the first casualty in Lanneau’s outfit), Union sympathizers and Mother Nature (in a training exercise “we encountered a real and not altogether insignificant enemy – viz., a swarm of yellow jackets: several horses and riders were wounded, but not mortally).","Lanneau’s notebook provides a glimpse at the quiet part of the Civil War that followed the Battle of Manassas in the east.  However, this quiet would be short-lived, as by May, 1862, Brooks Troop was fully engaged in the battles in and around Williamsburg and Yorktown, where it was the last Confederate unit to retreat.  When Hampton’s Legion was reorganized that June, new elections were held for officers.  Lanneau was not reelected as captain, so he joined the Confederate Engineer Corp to serve out the rest of the war.  He would return to teaching after the war."],"display_date":"April 17, 1861 - May 17, 1862","search_date":"1861-10-31","locations":[{"id":11535,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":675,"tag":"Hampton Legion"},{"id":674,"tag":"Furman University"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5035,"title":"The People's Lincoln","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-01","end_date":"1869-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In Lincoln’s time, public opinion vigilantly labeled a danger posed by their anti-Constitution imperialist.

the Cumming’s home.  Ragged and half-starved, these desperate soldiers took full liberties to raid their provisions, passing in hordes and killing their chickens.  Mrs. Cummings, however, did not deny the ravenous soldiers food. ","One of eleven children, Mrs. Doane (young Miss Cummings) lived with her family on a 3000 acre plantation in the low country of South Carolina at the fork of the Salkehatchie River.  When word came late one afternoon that her father was among the Confederate soldiers who were passing through Salkehatchie but could not get away to visit his family, it took her mother no time to make plans.  After giving her children their supper, she laid mattresses in the big covered wagon and put them to bed under the care of the faithful slave “Mudder.”  A slave drove the wagon as Mrs. Cummings drove the buggy with a baby in her lap and her eldest son at her side.  The experience of seeing her father and camping with the other families who had come to see their husbands and fathers was a thrilling memory that Mrs. Doane never forgot.","In addition to bravely carrying her family out to meet her husband, Mrs. Cummings also heroically saved the family cotton supply.  Mr. Cummings had left the gin house full of cotton when he went off to war, and many of their neighbors were also endowed with large supplies of cotton.  Upon hearing that the Yankees were coming, the neighbors decided to burn all the cotton rather than give the enemy of the pleasure of raiding their stores.  When they tried to persuade Mrs. Cummings to do likewise, she replied that there was nothing she could do about it if the Yankees came and burned the cotton, but until that time, she would keep her cotton right where it was.  Surprisingly, the Yankees never came, and Mrs. Cummings saved the cotton which would prove very profitable to the family in the years following the war.","The nation’s sudden emergence into the Civil War immediately transformed the South.  The role of women grew vastly to include all of the responsibilities of men, as their husbands were away at war.  At least at the beginning of the war, the romance of the military and its association with honor, courage, and glory was able to outweigh the reluctance of women to see their husbands leave them in charge at home.  Women were rudely awakened from their effeminate habits and learned not to privilege their personal interests.  All southerners seemed to realize that if the South were to survive, women had to be patriotic and assume the political interests of men.  As the self-sacrifice of women for their loved ones gradually turned into the self-sacrifice <em>of</em> their loved ones, women were faced with a conflict between patriotism and protectiveness.  Many women cared more deeply about their men than about the abstract cause of patriotism, and some broke down when the struggles of the war became too much for them.  The experiences of southern women during the Civil War were

1862, throughout the war-ravaged Confederacy, the thoughts of all were turned to the War that tore apart the country.  The death and destruction that had already occurred seemed to foretell a conflict that would not soon be resolved.  In the midst of the fighting, soldiers struggled to remain vigilant and confident.  Romanticized visions of passionate soldiers, Confederates in particular, were created to motivate future as well as current soldiers to continue fighting “the good fight.”  An ideal soldier was one who fought bravely for a cause he believed in, and these beliefs were strengthened when God was on his side.  Thus religion and the strength of a soldier’s faith were often tied directly to his ability to prevail in battle. ","An article in The Confederate Baptist entitled “Temperance in the Army” stated that there was evidence that the reason that battles had been lost was because of the drunkenness of the commanders.  Subsequent articles in the paper had already declared that God was on the side of the Confederacy; the postulation of a possible explanation of recent defeats looked to the soldiers themselves and their behavior while fighting for the Confederacy.  The author J.L. Reynolds looked to the experiences of other countries to teach a valuable lesson.  He cited the Madras Presidency, a part of present-day India, and the proportion of temperate men who died in battle to the number of drinkers who died in battle.  The number of temperate soldiers who died numbered 2,315.   The number of drinkers who died was 4,458.  According to Reynolds, “this proves that soldiers will be healthy in proportion to their temperance”.   Alcohol was “the bane of our soldiery,” and if use was not curbed immediately, the Confederacy, despite being divinely-ordained, would surely fall.","To bring these soldiers back to morality, religious revivals were often held in which missionaries traveled to soldiers’ camps to instill a renewed sense of faith.  These revivals also served to inspire the citizen morale that waned as the war dragged on and the death toll rose.  The temperance movement as a whole, however, was not an issue of great national or regional importance during the Civil War.  The Temperance Societies that had emerged in the decades prior had claimed millions of members but receded into the background as the nation faced a crisis of unprecedented proportions. "],"display_date":"October 1, 1862","search_date":"1862-10-01","locations":[{"id":11638,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":717,"tag":"Temperance"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5045,"title":"Song for a Gettysburg Soldier","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-04-01","end_date":"1864-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["He became famous and celebrated through his death. War stories are always full of heroes that appear larger than life and worthy of reverence, and those stories revolving around the Battle of Gettysburg are no different. Sergeant Amos Humiston of Company C of the 154<sup>th</sup> New York was one such man. Though not a hero in the traditional sense, in his death he became somewhat of a legend. During a retreat from what was overwhelming odds Humiston was shot, but what made him famous was that before he died, he pulled out a picture of his children for one last look, and when he was found days later the picture was still clutched in his hands. Though there were many thousands dead after that battle, he was the one that still spoke of love and devotion. Yet when they found him, they could not locate any identification so were not able to tell his wife and children about his death. People were so touched by this that the picture of his children was circulated in newspapers throughout the North to find his family. Eventually his wife saw the picture in a newspaper and realized that it was the same picture she had given her husband, so he was identified.","Though he was identified, his story had touched so many people that the <em>American Presbyterian</em>, a newspaper, announced a contest to compose a song about Humiston. James Clark’s “The Children of the Battle Field” won and was published in April, 1864. This song is very representative of its time and so serves to glorify both the war and death while in battle. In the song the war is romanticized describing how the “heroes of the North… rushed like mountain eagles forth from happy homes away”, and how during battle “banners, marked with ball and blood, around them arose and fell”. One of the most telling lines that serves to glorify his death in battle is that “none were braver in the strife”, serving to prove his noble death. The concept of the “Good Death” was a very popular one in nineteenth century America, in which how one dies symbolizes the life that one lead. So through his death on the battlefield and in the act of holding his children’s picture while he died, he truly had a “Good Death” which shall continue to be known through this song."],"display_date":"April 1864","search_date":"1864-04-15","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":104,"tag":"Popular Music"},{"id":407,"tag":"Death"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5049,"title":"Narrative of Walter Calloway, slave from Richmond, VA","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Imagine being purchased as a slave at ten years old, forced to relocate from Virginia to Alabama, and required to endure hours of hard labor and beatings.  This was the life of Walter Calloway, born in 1848 in Richmond, Virginia.  At the age of 10, Calloway was bought by slave master John Calloway whose plantation resided just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.  As he sat on a porch outside his home answering questions, he recalled the strenuous labor he performed at the tender age of ten, along with his mother and brother.  His master, who was often cruel to their slaves, was bearable and fed him well, but it was the overseer named “Green Bush” and African-American named Mose who performed the mistreatment to Walter and others.  Walter described the torture when he said, “Green Bush what sho’ whup us iffen we don’t do to suit him.  Yassuh, he mighty rough wid us be he didn’t do de whippin’ hisse’f.”  He continued to describe the beating of a fifteen-year-old girl that almost killed her.","As his labor took the majority of his time, Walter and the other slaves were deprived of schooling.  They were required to go to the school and take care of the white children at times, and he then stated the white men eventually all joined the Army, as was expected of them.  After the Civil War, Walter described the lack of action on the plantation except for “gangs of so’jers passin’ th’ough gwine off to de war.”  Confederate soldiers would pass through and take some of their food for the soldier’s rations.","Then the United States soldiers arrived on the plantation and he was told to warn Mrs. Freeman but before he returned the Union soldiers had wrecked havok on the plantation.  They destroyed the smoke house, hams, and the remainder of the rations.  He had heard they also burned cotton plantations and steamboats harbored in Montgomery.  Shortly after the war, Walter was freed but he was quick to state that “we ain’t nebber been what I calls free.”  He and the other slaves had no money and all were scattered in various different locations.  He ended his interview as he asked for help back into the house.","In the article “North American Slave Narratives” William Andrews described the importance of studying the narratives of slaves during the nineteenth century to better understand the time period, and the issues happening during their lives.  In addition, “the autobiographical narratives of former slaves comprise one of the most extensive and influential traditions in African American literature and culture”.  While the narratives provide excellent historical documents, they also helped bridge relationships between Africa-Americans and whites after the war, allowing for whites to begin to understand the repression the African-Americans had faced.","The narratives such as Walter’s will be used for generations in the future in order to attempt to grasp some sort of understanding about this troubling period in American history.  Charles L. Perdue provided his view of the importance of slave narratives in his book “Weevils in the Wheat: interviews with Virginia ex-slaves” when he said “Though most historians have not utilized the ex-slave interviews in the past, there is a growing realization that prior histories have been one-sided on the subject of slavery and that the slaves’ view of the institution is essential to round out the picture\".  The first-hand account of the period is invaluable to historians and students alike and he further explained, “the ex-slave interviews provide us with insights into Afro-American culture that are not obtainable from other sources”.  Stories like Walter Calloway’s must continue to be shared and studied to shed further light on their troubles and the tribulations they worked to overcome.","Walter’s narrative not only described the horrible mistreatment of slaves, but the lack of the value of African-American lives during the nineteenth century.  They were purchased as commodities and forced to work hard labor as young as ten years old.  Although Walter and his mother and brother were able to stay together, this was often not the case and most families were separated and spread throughout the country."," "],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":300,"lat":32.2508016784,"lng":-86.1660804753,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5052,"title":"Undying Devotion: The Glorification of Sacrifice","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-07-14","end_date":"1861-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Encamped in the wilderness of Virginia, mere days before his death in the first battle of the Civil War, a young major set pen to paper and began to write. In poignant eloquence, Sullivan Ballou described the conflicting forces at the heart of his identity. Though consumed by undying love for his wife, his patriotic devotion drove him forward toward battle—and death.“[M]y love of Country,” he wrote, “comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on… If I do not [return], never forget how much I love you, and as my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it shall whisper your name...But, O Sarah! if the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you—in the garish days and darkest nights…always, always….Sarah do not mourn me dead—think I am gone and wait for thee—for we shall meet again…”","Sullivan Ballou was born in rural Rhode Island, in 1829 and was left destitute by his father’s death just four years later. Intelligent, eloquent, and committed to own self-creation, Sullivan struggled to support his family and put himself through school. He attended Brown University and then the National Law School before being admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-four. He was thereafter elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives, serving as clerk and then Speaker of the House. When war erupted, he was among the first to enlist, leaving his nascent political career to more actively serve his beloved country. At Bull Run, while rallying his men forward, he was shot from his horse and mortally wounded. When he died seven days later, his body was exhumed, decapitated, and set aflame by occupying Confederate soldiers.","His belief in self-improvement and personal recreation reflected the Lincolnian ideology of the Republican Party; his every action attests to the convictions of the Victorian Era. Self-worth was tied to public service, a truth reified in Sullivan’s career as a lawyer, politician, and soldier. His patriotism was tied to Victorian ideals of manhood and self-sacrifice—one’s willingness to defend one’s homes and families, to value one’s nation over one’s own personal interests. His final words articulate the “cult of death” that pervaded contemporary thought. To many American colonists, death was the culmination of one’s search for salvation, ending for many in eternal damnation. In the nineteenth century, those beliefs were reevaluated, and new ideas glorified and romanticized the afterlife. This new understanding, intimately binding life and death, prompted the ritualization of burial and mourning. Sullivan’s widow—like many of her generation—never remarried, mourning her martyred husband for the rest of her life. Only in 1917, at the age of eighty-two, did she at last rejoin Sullivan in fulfillment of the words he had written fifty-six years ago."],"display_date":"July 14, 1861","search_date":"1861-07-14","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":724,"tag":"Cult of Death"},{"id":723,"tag":"Victorian Era"},{"id":722,"tag":"Love letter"},{"id":721,"tag":"Rhode Island"},{"id":516,"tag":"Battle of Bull Run"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5061,"title":"<strong>How Shall They Be Remembered?</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-02-20","end_date":"1861-02-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the years of his term in office, President Lincoln read two letters that were to remind him of how our nation was forged.  Abraham Lincoln, like most other presidents, received letters giving him praise and thanks for all the work he had done.  Abraham Lincoln also received mail detailing news from the battle front and giving support from the home front.  Two of those letters focused more on another war that represented America’s shining moment in unifying the nation – the American War for Independence.","In the first letter, a woman sends a letter than contains two items to Abraham Lincoln in 1861.  The woman was Sarah Smith Stafford, the only daughter of an officer on the frigate <em>Alliance</em>.  The first item she sent to Lincoln was a piece of the American flag that was flown on the frigate, which “upon that flag, can be seen the shot holes, and blood stains, of those martyrs to Freedom.”  The second item was a piece of wood from the very vessel.  Although there is no story of the battle, it shows that even before Abraham Lincoln took office, there was a lot of support for him.  At this time, the South was seceding and becoming the Confederate States of America.  The United States faced its darkest hour: a civil war.  This letter was to represent a reminder of all the veterans that fought in the Revolutionary War who had fought for the freedom the U.S. now had.","In the second letter, the war was close to an end, although none of the participants could tell.   Ulysses Grant had captured Vicksburg, and Lincoln was setting up his armies for an end to the war.  This letter came to him on February 25, as the end of winter drew near.  The son of a Revolutionary war veteran wrote the letter.  The letter describes his father’s actions at Bunker Hill and how the writer received $5 from General George Washington himself.","In both letters, the Revolutionary war veterans receive much praise and honor for their duty.  Their stories and work were for freedom, for the country, for the protection of its citizens.  The author of these letters wanted to remind Lincoln that this war needed not to be about bickering and massacring, but about unifying the nation and protecting its citizens.  Another point of these letters was a reminder of those who have gone before to protect their freedom.  How should the veterans of a war nearly one hundred years ago be honored in a war splitting that same nation they fought for?  David Waldstreicher discuess how veterans were not always treated right, by discussing an issue where they could not receive their war pensions.  In truth, by the Civil War, many were looking at more recent wars for heroes and celebrating holidays without too much thought of what they meant.  However, these letters were to remind Lincoln that America was still young, and could easily fall back if it did not find a way to bring back the South."],"display_date":"February 20, 1861 - February 25, 1861","search_date":"1861-02-22","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":728,"tag":"Veterans"},{"id":727,"tag":"American Revolution"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5064,"title":"Remembering Our Gallant Dead","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-14","end_date":"1863-01-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dealing with death is as unavoidable as death itself.  Grief that weighs on the hearts of those who have lost someone dear to them is a great burden to bear.  Imagine then the amount of sorrow and mourning in the Confederate States at the height of the American Civil War.  Ways of thinking about and dealing with the amount of loss of life during the Civil War were diverse.  William C. Davis in his book, The Cause Lost: Myths and Realities of the Confederacy, addresses the changes that took place throughout the war in how citizens in the South dealt with the overwhelming personal loss.  At the onset of the war, Davis explains; when patriotism and military zeal were at their highest points, men were quick to rush off to join the ranks and the great adventure that awaited them.  Similarly, those who suffer the loss of a family member early in the war in large part viewed the death as a heroic sacrifice to a just cause.

Many came to see the war as a holy crusade of Christian, civilized Southerners fighting against an atheistic, barbaric North; the theory that Just War could be a form of Christian discipleship was invoked and applied.","While other churches and newspapers were swept up in the three-pronged defense of secession as a Constitutional right, necessary to economic freedom, and a Biblical mandate, <em>The Biblical Recorder </em>and a few other Christian organizations stood firm in advocating nonviolent resistance and the use of spiritual, moral authority and power. The diversity of opinion among just Southern denominations about secession and the Civil War is only a microcosm of nationwide diversity that leaves the feeling that reconciliation may have been impossible."],"display_date":"March 10, 1838","search_date":"1838-03-10","locations":[{"id":9841,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5082,"title":"The Confederacy: Religion, Government, and – Diversity?","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-10-08","end_date":"1862-10-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“Rulers,” insisted the editor of the <em>Confederate Baptist</em>, “were entitled<em> elahim</em>, gods, because, as the New Testament informs us, they are ‘God’s ministers,’ ordained for the temporal welfare of the body politic.” The October 8, 1862 article was written when the South and her religions were in the throes of the Civil War.","Ironically, a newspaper which had advocated secession two years previously was now urging its readers to cede their faith to a new governing body, Jefferson Davis, his cabinet, and the Congress of the Confederate States of America.","As the United States Congress had done, the Confederate Congress approved and funded a certain version of the Holy Scriptures, which would be used in the Confederate armies.

Over 46,000 Americans were either wounded, killed, or captured in three days of fighting. One moment, occurring on the last day of the battle, stands out from the rest. Pickett’s charge, which took place on the third and final day of the battle, is considered to be one on the biggest military blunders of the war. While Pickett’s name is forever attached to the failed charge, it was planned and orchestrated by another Confederate leader, General Longstreet.","The blunder of the charge is documented in a manuscript produced by a staff officer under Longstreet, Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle. While Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle is not critical of Longstreet’s plan, the problems with how the charge was orchestrated is evident in his reflection of the day’s events. “The distance between the Confederate guns and the Yankee position--<em>i. e.,</em> between the woods crowning the opposite ridges was at least a mile--quite open, gently undulating, and exposed to artillery the whole distance. This was the ground which had to be crossed in to-day's attack. Pickett's division, which has just come up, was to bear the brunt in Longstreet's attack, together with Heth and Pettigrew in Hill's corps. Pickett's division was a weak one (under 5,000), owing to the absence of two brigades.”  When analyzing the strategy Longstreet employs when preparing the charge, the flaws become apparent.","Pickett’s division, which was below normal strength, would be the main effort and would thus face the majority of Union fire. Not only would Pickett’s force, which was undermanned, face the majority of the fire, the division would have to cross one mile of open ground, and attack an enemy force that was well entrenched at the top of the hill. Though Pickett protested to General Lee, stating “General I have no division, ” Lee ordered the charge to take place anyway.","Though Pickett received the majority of the blame for the blunder of the charge, he was acting under orders from superior officers. Often Longstreet is forgotten as the main player and orchestrator of the deadly charge. Longstreet later reflected on the mistakes made to Lieutenant Colonel Fremantle. “At 2 P. M. we walked to General Longstreet's camp, which had been removed to a place three miles distant, on the Fairfield road. General Longstreet talked to me for a long time about the battle. He said the mistake they had made was in not concentrating the army more, and making the attack yesterday with 30,000 men instead of 15,000. The advance had been in three lines, and the troops of Hill's corps who gave way were young soldiers, who had never been under fire before. He thought the enemy would have attacked had the guns been withdrawn.”","Though the blame is often laid onto General Pickett,he was only acting under orders. If his division wasn't ordered to be the main effort it can be argued that the blunder of the charge would rest on someone else's shoulders. However, General Longstreet's plan can be viewed as blunder in itself. Ultimately the confederate line charged a well entrenched enemy."],"display_date":"July 3, 1863 - July 3, 1883","search_date":"1873-07-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":697,"tag":"Historiography"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5091,"title":"The Legacy of Andersonville Prison; Who is to Blame?","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-02-27","end_date":"1865-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The concept of enemy prisoner of war camps was a new idea at the time of the American Civil War. Previously soldiers that surrendered on the battlefield were often paroled. These soldiers were expected to return home and lay down their arms. However, often these men would return home then reenlist and fight the enemy again. Armies recognizing this problem placed punishments on soldiers who were captured violating their parole. Though these punishments were in place, there was really no efficient way to keep track of those who violated their parole, thus enemy prisoner of war camps were established. Although prisoners were placed in these camps, often treatment and conditions were so difficult that there was no guarantee that they would survive. The best example from the American Civil War is Andersonville prison camp Andersonville prisoners suffered so immensely that the camp’s commander was trailed and imprisoned for war crimes. Attaching blame to the commander was and is the obvious course of action, however, reviewing the history of the camp reveals different information.  Who is actually to blame?"," ","Howell Cobb, the commander of the military district Andersonville was located recognized the problem of overcrowding in the camp as early as May of 1864. “There are now in the prison twelve thousand prisoners…The effect of increasing number within the present area must be a terrific increase of sickness and death during the summer months.” So while the conditions suffered by Union soldier imprisoned with the walls of the were horrible, it was recognized by the Confederate administration that conditions were sub-standard."," ","So who is to blame? Many argue that is the responsibility of the commander of the camp. However, the commander was not allocated resources sufficient care for the number of prisoners interred at the camp. The Confederacy, when conditions at Andersonville were at their all time worst, barely had the resources to provide for armies in the field, so naturally, the amount of resources allocated to the commander of the camp extremely limited. Blame can be assigned ultimately by putting the situation in historical perspective."," ","Perspective is an interesting subject in regards to how the legacy of a particular event or place is viewed. Often, especially when the event or place is viewed negatively, blame shifts depending which side the reviewer takes. Pro-Union reviewers will place blame on the commander, or the Confederate government for the conditions suffered by the union detainees.  However, conversely pro-Confederate reviewers will place blame on the lack of resources across the Confederate states and will cite similar instances in camps located in Union territory for committing similar atrocities.

The Civil War and slavery were two topics of main concern for many southerners. John Francis Campbell, a man from England who visited America in the fall of 1864 wrote of his travels in his memoir, “A Short American Tramp on the Fall of 1864.” As he writes of Louisville, one can feel not only the racial tension, but the overall tension due to the Civil War. Lynch law was prevalent in the land. Blacks were fighting, some for their freedom, others out of duty. In the south, war was everywhere. The vast agricultural flatlands provided areas for battle. The Confederacy knew this land well.  Campbell was an eyewitness to all of these things, he saw the armies, the soldiers, the free blacks and the slaves, and the mingling between races that often resulted in bloodshed. Campbell believed that the country was committing suicide with this war that seemed so pointless. Society was crumbling in the south and the border states. Campbell heard of a man who liked to kill black men and had already done so to about a half-dozen because he “likes to see them fall.”","One day Campbell was talking with who he called, “a very intelligent darky.” (p 335) The man was not a freeman but belonged to a man in Tennessee and did not receive anything for his work. Campbell then remarked that “The answer made the blood of a free-born citizen glow, and drew a tip of course.” (p 335) Campbell can not come to understand why there is so much hatred amongst the races. He admires the nobility of the blacks who “take up arms to fight for liberty.” One morning as he was around a black regiment camp, he noticed the light atmosphere and jubilant attitudes amongst the soldiers. Banjos and fiddles were being played and freedom was ringing.","When the Civil War began, Kentucky was a border state and declared neutrality. Kentucky was a slave-state, and the slave trade business helped make many Kentuckians wealthy. Kentucky also had ties in trade with both the North and South and any disruption with either because of war would hurt their economy. President Lincoln realized the importance of having Kentucky in the Union in order to win the war, and eventually Kentucky sided with the Union. Kentucky held some battles and skirmishes during the Civil War and Louisville was one of the major camps for the Union Army.","Campbell was an eyewitness to the horrors of what America was going through during the Civil War Era. The Civil War, in his opinion, was suicide for the Americans. He saw all wonders and achievements that the United States had accomplished, and now they were risking it all, over disagreements. Campbell, during his travels caught up with a Yankee and was asked his opinion on the war and responded, “You have the finest country I ever saw, plenty of room, corn, cotton, coal; plenty to eat, and might be the greatest people on earth: and yet you fight the biggest battles ever fought, and do more harm to yourselves than any people ever did to a foe in the same short time. I think you are darned fools for fighting; and that's my opinion.' The Yankee scratched his head, and then a smile came over his phiz [sic], and he spoke: 'Wal [sic], maybe that's so.'” (p 340) Clearly, Campbell picked a major time in America’s history to visit, especially to visit the south.

Doubleday became responsible for the entire battlefield and holding back the Confederate advances until the full strength of the Union’s First Corps could be brought up. His units demonstrated incredible bravery throughout the day and Doubleday himself showed exceptional skill as a commander in his handling of the battlefield. From McPherson’s Ridge to Cemetery Hill and Seminary Ridge, the First Corps and the other units under Doubleday’s command fought well against the Confederate forces and fought a gallant rear-guard action as Union forces withdrew to the heights surrounding Gettysburg. Doubleday’s official battle report touts the importance of his actions in giving the entire army time to establish good ground outside Gettysburg leading to the eventual rout of the Confederate forces. Though Doubleday is not mentioned by name in many subsequent accounts of Gettysburg, the First Corps is glorified for its actions during the engagement and it was Doubleday who commanded them for much of the first day. Why then, is Doubleday not touted as a hero of Gettysburg or great stories written about the units he commanded?","Due to a false report from General Howard, who assumed command of the First Corps upon his arrival at McPherson’s Ridge, General Hancock was under the impression, and so reported to General Meade, “that Doubleday’s command gave way” and consequently Meade replaced Doubleday for the remainder of the Gettysburg battle with a junior officer. Regardless of this demotion in battlefield rank, on the third day of the battle, Doubleday’s command withstood the fury of the Confederate artillery barrage and subsequently repulsed Pickett’s Charge. He ordered his Vermont regiment, under General Stannard, to seize on a perfect opportunity and flank the oncoming Confederate forces, who had successfully reached Union lines and “a few of them even laid their hands on [Union] guns.<sup>” </sup>","The actions by the Vermont regiment arguably saved the day for Union line, however following the battle there was much debate between Hancock and Stannard as to who gave the order to execute the flanking movement. Hancock and Meade are given the credit for repulsing Pickett’s charge, leaving Doubleday unrewarded once again, and the re-telling of Pickett’s charge (from both Union and Confederate perspectives) in history books and fiction works alike, give glory to the Confederates for their bravery and discipline; nothing is said about the small units like Stannard’s Vermont men who saved the Union line. Doubleday never forgave Hancock and Howard for their false reports and the promotion of a junior officer over him. This false report gave Doubleday only temporary status in regards to Gettysburg, it was a slight against his record and his reports about his actions and the actions of his men were subsequently overlooked. Thus General Doubleday was kept from being written into the annals Gettysburg greats alongside the likes of Buford and Chamberlain and glorified as a hero.

Gordon, being a Southern Gentleman and a reputable man, sought to bring as little disgrace upon his enemy as possible. He wanted to be the embodiment of a war hero—a man who was noble in his actions—and he desired to be noted for it. In many ways, Gordon was quite impressive; the Georgian had quickly advanced through the army in spite of having no formal military training, survived horrific wounds, and was widely celebrated throughout the South. As such, when he was instructed under the direction of General Robert E. Lee to avoid damaging the towns through which he and his soldiers traversed to battle, he undoubtedly wanted to live up to Lee’s expectations. The instructions were simple: people and property were not to be damaged or harmed by the Confederate Army; the war was to be fought on the battlefield.","No matter how insignificant Gordon claimed it to be, his troops devastated certain areas. In one instance, Gordon’s troops took the pickets of a wooden fence and used them for firewood. In another, they took horses from Yankee homes, and Gordon said it was justifiable by pointing out that in the “South horses were being taken by the Union soldiers” and that he was simply “trying on a small scale to balance accounts.” In spite of Gordon’s dismissal of Confederate actions as minor, Confederate troops caused two million dollars worth of damage in Pennsylvania in 1863.","Shortly after these instances, Gordon’s troops reached Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, where Gordon’s chivalry would be tried and the reputation he prided himself on affronted. The Confederates came upon a group of Union soldiers at the Wrightsville Bridge and resolved to drive them back so that they would be able to cross the river and continue their advance. The Union soldiers swiftly set fire to the bridge in their affright to prevent Gordon’s crossing, but the Union soldiers had made an irreparable error; the fire that was meant to protect them began to spread, engulfing a lumberyard and eventually threatening the whole town. As the fire grew, quick-thinking Gordon took to searching for a bucket or pail with which to extinguish the fire. Unfortunately, he didn't find one until the situation became dire. At this point, the townspeople realized that they would have to aid the Confederates if they wanted their town to survive.","In the end, the Confederates failed to save the bridge, but the town was not completely destroyed. While Gordon defended the actions of his men, Northern newspapers called their comportment into question by asserting that they had set the Wrightsville Bridge on fire, enraging the General. Gordon’s strong reaction to this, as well as his desire to create and maintain such a heroic image of himself, call his motivations into question in regards to the Wrightsville bridge incident and the War in general. Was he living up to his “southern gentleman” reputation and genuinely trying to save the town from the raging fire, or did he simply want to get his men across the river? Perhaps he reacted so strongly because of his desire to create his own war history and become a legend that would be remembered for generations. Furthermore, it is interesting that in his official report he complained about the bridge, but he did not make as big of a deal about it as he does in his own book. It is difficult to understand the complexity of his motivations. Nevertheless, one thing is evident from Gordon’s memoirs: He wanted to be remembered as a man of great honor and chivalry, and the Civil War offered him the perfect medium through which to do it."],"display_date":"June 28, 1863","search_date":"1863-06-28","locations":[{"id":11364,"lat":39.9199204801,"lng":-76.7265166341,"zoom":9,"place":"YORK, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":915,"tag":"John Brown Gordon"},{"id":914,"tag":"Wrightsville"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5179,"title":"General William Rosecrans' Report at the Battle of Chickamauga","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-09-19","end_date":"1863-09-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Major General William Rosecrans, commander of the U.S. Army of the Cumberland, awoke nervous on September 20, 1863. His forces at Chickamauga had been assailed throughout the previous day but held their ground. Rosecrans did not know if they could withstand another day of Confederate assault, however. He also did not know that he was about to give an order that would swing the battle, the Chattanooga campaign, and his own legacy as a commander.","That morning Rosecrans inspected his line and found that its left, which he felt should be protected at all costs, was vulnerable. Two hours after fighting began, Rosecrans was incorrectly informed that a gap existed along his left. He ordered General Thomas Wood on the Union right to move left and close the gap: “The general commanding directs that you close up on Reynolds as fast as possible, and support him.” The problem was, a Confederate force opposite Wood had been waiting for an opportunity to charge. When Wood moved left the Confederates, according to Rosecrans, “poured in through this breach,” breaking through the Union lines and driving several of Rosecrans’ divisions from the field. The breakthrough proved to be the decisive movement of the battle, a Confederate victory. How and why was this order given?","The report from General George Thomas that “Reynolds’ right was exposed” was met with fear and panic by Rosecrans, historian Glenn Tucker notes. Caught up in the heat of the moment, Rosecrans directed his aide-de-camp, Major Frank Bond, to write the fateful order. Chief among Rosecrans’ errors, according to Tucker, was that he did not consult his chief of staff, Brigadier General James Garfield, who was busy, when deciding what action to take. Garfield knew the positions of each Union regiment and would have been able to inform Rosecrans that a gap did not actually exist.","In his official report Rosecrans reluctantly admits that, without his mistake, the Union army would probably have driven the Confederates from the field. Even with the fateful order, Rosecrans describes Chickamauga as a resounding victory since the Union ultimately held Chattanooga. Tucker disagrees and places blame on Rosecrans, arguing that his erratic temperament led to the reckless advance. Rosecrans biographer William Lamers puts Wood at fault, since he should have told Rosecrans the move was impossible. Not suprisingly, Rosecrans downplayed his errors in his official report. His commanders saw through the semantics, however, and relieved him of his command less than one month later.","The order would haunt Rosecrans for the rest of his life. He wrote an article in the May 1887 issue of the Century Illustrated magazine justifying the entire Chattanooga campaign, arguing that miscommunication between Reynolds, Wood, Thomas and Brigadier General John Brannan created the gap in the Union line. His <em>New York Times</em> obituary in 1898 did not pull any punches, however, blaming the Chickamauga defeat on Rosecrans. Even in death Rosecrans could not escape the fateful order.","Regardless of fault, Rosecrans’ order was significant because it gave the Confederates their only major victory in the western theatre of the war. Additionally, not even one of the war's most competent commanders could avoid the communications breakdowns that often plagued armies. Clearly, Rosecrans had good reason to be nervous that foggy September morning."],"display_date":"September 19, 1863 - September 20, 1863","search_date":"1863-09-19","locations":[{"id":12053,"lat":35.1803733014,"lng":-85.1633326083,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"},{"id":2308,"lat":34.7357841762,"lng":-85.3009353974,"zoom":9,"place":"WALKER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":917,"tag":"William Rosecrans"},{"id":916,"tag":"The Battle of Chickamauga"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5182,"title":"The Tragedy known as Pickett's Charge","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-03","end_date":"1863-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The veteran soldiers geared for the attack, confident in their strategy and ability, ready to accept nothing less than success.  As the enemy forces approached and the men “spearheaded the charge” with all that they had, it quickly became evident that it was not going to be enough.  The “Union artillery opened” on the Confederates’ “parade-ground ranks” and the group suffered greatly under the hail of fire.  Pickett’s division was destroyed.  Those left retreated in utter failure as the Union soldiers walked away relatively unscathed.  It was the battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, July 3, 1863.  The doomed brigades were led into battle by 38 year old General George Edward Pickett.  Little did they know that this moment would be labeled by historians as one of the most futile assaults in American military history, Pickett’s Charge.","General Pickett was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia.  He was no star pupil, graduating 59th of 59 from West Point in 1846, along with fellow Confederate General “Stonewall” Jackson and Union General McClellan.  Pickett was an arrogant and spirited child, an attitude that seemed to stick with him for the remainder of his years and severely hindered his progress and performance as a military leader.  Described by a Union prisoner as the “archetype of the Virginia slave-baron,” Pickett was a well dressed Southern aristocrat with long ringlets that attracted attention from women and men alike.  His fellow officers rarely responded to him in any efficient or positive manner, and his arrogance and pride were blazingly displayed before his fall.  General Robert E. Lee was never aware of what to expect from the irresponsible young man, who at times seemed to be far more concerned with his new flame, LaSalle Corbell, whom he would soon marry.","A firsthand account of the battle from Pickett himself is not available.  In fact, there are relatively few of Pickett’s personal documents to contribute to the history if his military career.  His beloved Sallie’s rather biased accounts of his campaigns make up a great deal of the historiography available to historians, rendering it difficult for scholars to fully understand what happened that dreadful day in Pennsylvania.  This disastrous charge is the subject of surprisingly little historical scholarship.  Carol Reardon raises the question of whether or not a true account of any battle is realistically possible.  This one is especially difficult without an official record from the commanding officer, only secondhand accounts with which to work.","In general, Pickett’s behavior appears to have elicited personal attacks and a kind of distrust from the other officers, and he and his men had served as onlookers for much of the major fighting.  With Lee’s quick decision to fight the Union at Gettysburg, however, he would need all of the men available, including Pickett’s new division.  With vague instruction and a confident façade, Pickett led his brigade in a questionable formation described “generally as a two-rank line, with a variety of incongruities” straight into unmerciful fire from the Union infantry. This strange organization evidently left them very exposed.  The resultant deaths and injuries scarred soldiers from both sides, and hearts were bleeding for all of Virginia because of the great number of men lost that day.  It comes as no surprise that Pickett has been the topic of many rumors and criticisms since.","Years after the miserable failure, Pickett met with Lee again in 1870.  John Mosby, who escorted Pickett, reported that the general had said of Lee, “‘that old man’ had ruined his career and caused his division to be ‘massacred’ at Gettysburg.”  General George Pickett died on July 30, 1875, probably unaware of just how helpful Lee had been in his defense.  As Pickett’s reputation crumbled and he was severely criticized as a leader, Lee took much of the blame for himself.  Pickett had never truly recovered from the gruesome loss, though, and the memories of that day haunted him and helped produce the bitter feelings that he had held for his contemporary."," "],"display_date":"July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-03","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5183,"title":"General Ambrose P.

It was day one of the Battle of Gettysburg and Ambrose Powell Hill was about to face his first battle as the promoted commander of the Third Corps, a position Hill was eager to live up to. Hill distinguished himself in the first battles of the Civil War as the leader of the fabled \"Light Brigade\" but this day he faced more responsibility in one of the most important battles of the war to date.","The promotion came along with the devastating death of Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson mere weeks before the Battle of Gettysburg. Hill and the ever-praised Jackson had often clashed; one of their altercations even ended with Hill's arrest by Jackson. In the wake of Jackson's death Confederate General Robert E. Lee divided up his corps into three divisions, giving command of one division to Hill. Earlier in the Civil War Hill received much criticism from other Confederate leaders for his tendency towards tardiness and subsequent high volume of stragglers during his marches when he raced to compensate. He felt this battle was his chance to prove his competence and military skill once and for all.","On the first day of battle Hill led his men in a march towards the town of Gettysburg. Along the way they encountered Federal troops assumed to be cavalry. Not until it was too late did Hill and his soldiers realize these troops were a veteran Union force that was able to \"dispute the further advance\" of the Confederates. Hill noted in his report \"the want of cavalry had been and was again seriously felt\" but his troops were able to halt the enemies' move through the town. At this point Hill felt it prudent to cease fighting for the day and allow his men to rest. As he had long been criticized for not allowing his men mandatory rest breaks, this was a deliberate gesture on Hill's part. The next day fighting resumed and Hill described the incredible resistance of the Union forces. He also commented on the inability of his troops, guided by many able subordinates, to breach the line. Hill stated in his battle report that his men started day three in the same position they had started day two. However historians agree that Hill's battle report leaves much to be desired in the way of clear explanations of action. Some suggest his ailing health left him unable to take charge of his men and led him to spend much of his time in the company of General Lee instead of with his troops. There is little favorable evidence that Hill even came close to his predecessor Jackson's military skill.","Day three of the battle brought the famous Pickett's Charge, although Hill's report suggested this might be an ill-fitting moniker for the assault. Hill listed the troops engaged, putting no particular emphasis on Pickett's men since Pickett's men were in Longstreet's corps and in conclusion of the charge, merely wrote \"the assault failed and our troops fell back in disorder.\" This rather abrupt conclusion to the report on one of the Civil War's most important engagements is indicative of General Hill's great disappointment in the performance of his troops as well as the outcome of the battle. Hill was no Stonewall Jackson, a truth that was painfully apparent after the Battle of Gettysburg."," "],"display_date":"July 1, 1863 - July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":920,"tag":"Pickett's Charge"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":912,"tag":"Gettysburg"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5187,"title":"George Meade: Hero at Gettysburg?","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-01","end_date":"1863-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["George Meade was the commander of the Union Army of the Potomac during one of the most well-known battles of the Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg from July 1-3, 1863, and he is one of the war's least well-known generals. As Meade learned of the escalating battle at Gettysburg, PA on July 1, he began ordering his army toward the town. At the end of the first day, the Confederate force failed to take Cemetery Ridge, a crucial position. Meade reported that the enemy was satisfied with his success and therefore did not attack the important ridge. This lack of aggressiveness was a significant Confederate mistake.","Meade arrived on the battlefield at 1 A.M. on July 2. The fact that the commander of the Union army missed an entire day of fighting shows that the Battle of Gettysburg was a spontaneous, incidental battle. Upon his arrival Meade immediately began distributing his army along the fish hook-shaped Union line in anticipation of a Confederate attack. On July 2, Meade successfully placed his soldiers in places where they could repel the Confederate attacks on the Union flanks. The next day, Meade’s army gave Lee a crippling defeat by crushing the massive frontal assault on the center of the line. In his report of the battle, Meade gave much credit to the bravery of his men, stating that they stubbornly resisted Lee’s enormous attacks.","After the battle, Meade was unable to pursue and destroy the Army of Northern Virginia. General Robert E. Lee was able to escape across the Potomac River into Virginia on July 13. Meade stated in his report that he made an effort to engage the Confederates. He claimed that Lee had taken up strong defensive positions in the Fairfield Pass and that the Union army had to pause for a day to obtain supplies. In a letter to Meade that he did not send, Abraham Lincoln wrote “I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee’s escape.” Meade offered to resign, but Lincoln kept him as commander of the army. ","History often remembers the Battle of Gettysburg as a costly mistake made by Robert E. Lee. His failure to communicate the importance of taking Cemetery Ridge on July 1, his decision to attack the strong Union position on July 2, and the abysmal failure of Pickett’s Charge make the battle seem more like Lee’s blunder than a genius victory for Meade. The defeat was costly for Lee; however, his army remained intact after a perceived lack of aggressiveness on Meade’s part. In late 1863, Lincoln gave Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant control of all Union armies. History recognizes Grant as the general who defeated Lee. Perhaps the nature of the Battle of Gettysburg, the magnitude of Lee’s mistakes, Meade’s lack of aggressiveness, or a mixture of these factors is the reason why George Meade is not a well-known name to Americans today.  "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"July 1, 1863 - July 13, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-07","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":519,"tag":"War: American Civil War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5189,"title":"Chamberlain's Defense of Little Round Top","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-02","end_date":"1863-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 2, 1863, Colonel Strong Vincent looked to Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine regiment to defend Little Round Top “at every hazard”.  It was vital for the Union army to not lose this hilltop position to prevent the Confederates from breaking through their lines. At Gettysburg, the 20th Maine and other Union troops took both Little Round Top and Big Round Top. They have become immortalized through the accounts of Joshua Chamberlain.","Writers and scholars alike have found the narrative style of Chamberlain’s after action report to be both unique and captivating. It was his own artful and inspirational portrayal of the battle that brought Joshua Chamberlain fame as America’s Gettysburg hero.","In his report, what Chamberlain did not disclose is as important, if not more, than what he did. The report of Joshua Chamberlain found in the Official Records, dated July 6th, 1863, was actually recreated from memory in 1884 because government editors lost the original. Combined with the the discrepancies of his report and the reports of other participants in the battle, Chamberlain’s accuracy and role in the victory on Little Round Top comes into question.","In Chamberlain’s report, the Union regiments initially opened fire at close range and pushed the Confederates into taking shelter. Soon after, a final assault by the Confederate forces came. All seemed lost for the 20th regiment on Little Round Top as their ammunition depleted, until a rash call by Chamberlain for the bayonet and hand-to-hand combat took the Confederates by surprise.  Chamberlain claimed, “the effect was surprising; many of the enemy’s first line threw down their arms and surrendered.”","In the view of the soldiers of the 20th Maine, many agreed that their attack with the bayonets was the result of their pent up frustrations in the battle. According to their accounts, Chamberlain never said “charge”, as he later claimed, he only called that they fix the bayonet and prepare for a charge.","At the time of this charge, Confederate Colonel Calvin Oates had begun to withdraw Confederate troops seeing the ineffectiveness of their rally for Little Round Top. Along with the move by Oates and Colonel Michael Bulger to disperse and detach Confederate troops prior to the battle, Chamberlain faced depleted Confederate forces that were much smaller than he would later claim.","Later in life, Joshua Chamberlain sought to defend his legacy and story against the contradictory reports of the battle. In particular, both Colonel Oates and Colonel Elias Spear challenged his presentation of the battle.  Chamberlain’s unwillingness to admit the true efforts of Oates’ troops and their thrusts on the crest of Vincent’s spur, led to the denial of a battlefield monument for Oates’ 15th Alabama regiment.

Among the nearly 200,000 men preparing to engage in battle, just under two thousand were Irish Americans. These men, new to the land, had been conscripted into service almost as soon as setting dry-foot upon US soil. Despite the Irish immingrants' recent arrival, they were more than ready to fight. Thomas Galley described the Irish Brigade on the eve of battle coming “out from the city in glorious file, their green sunbursts waving…\" In his account every man had \"a sprig of green in his cap and a half-laughing, half murderous look in their eyes.” Galley's chronicle demonstrates how the men of this Irish unit instilled fear into anyone who would dare form ranks against them.","<br />In December of 1862, the US Civil War was in full swing. Throughout the ranks of Union forces, Irish immigrants were segregated into their own units. These soldiers were a unique breed of individual. An atmosphere of myth lay centered around the Irish soldiers of the Civil War. For the Americans who were fighting, they understood the causes of war. However, many of the Irish, having no knowledge of American politics, neither understood the war nor the reasons for which they were fighting and dying. Because of this, the American-born soldiers admired the willingness of the Irish immgrants to fight and die for a cause that was not their own. Galley describes the Irish rank's death-march as they attacked an entrenched enemy position and became the target of Confederate volleys: “they passed just to our left, poor fellows, poor, glorious fellows, shaking goodbye to us with their hats! They reach a point within a stone’s throw of the stone wall. No further.“","<br />This image is representative of Irish units throughout the Civil War. Galley’s account illustrates the iconic nature of these Irish soldiers. While marching full force into what they knew would be their last engagement, the men were smiling and laughing, with a look of passion and murder in their eye; from the perspective of American soldiers, this kind of bravery bordered on insanity.","<br />Because of the actions and attitudes like that of these Irish soldiers in battle at Fredericksburg, the opinion and attitude towards Irish immigrants changed for some Americans. While the Irish would have a long road towards equality, for those Americans who served in battle with the Irish, progress was made towards integration with those that, “try to go beyond, but are slaughtered.”<br /><br />"],"display_date":"December 11, 1862 - December 15, 1862","search_date":"1862-12-13","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":958,"tag":"Irish Immigration"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5233,"title":"Lewis Parsons Writes Home","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-28","end_date":"1864-05-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lewis E. Parsons served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War as a private in the Washington Artillery of New Orleans. During his time of service in the war, Parsons wrote around twelve letters that he sent to his family in Talladega, Alabama. Parsons tried to write a letter every chance he had some free time to himself. He specifically states in a May 28 letter “I write whenever I get a chance.” Parsons would write a letter every time he came in from the battle field. He also told his family “you don’t know how it relieves my mind to have a letter on the way home.” This one letter that he writes certainly shows how homesick he had become. He says “you all may miss me a great deal but not as much as I miss you.” This specific letter that Parsons writes gives a good description of how much he missed his family, and this could be said for many other soldiers of the Civil War. Many other soldiers felt the same way that Parsons did about missing his family, and these letters were taken very serious by everyone involved.","Writing to family members was very important to the soldiers of the Civil War. These men probably would not have been able to stay sane for very long if it was not for the letters that they got to write to their family members and also the letters that the families sent back to the soldiers. James Pate gives a historical account of some brothers in the Civil War that also wrote letters back and forth to their family. Pate comments on how the brothers “directed most of their letters to family members.” This family took these letters very seriously, and they made every effort to keep the letters going to each other during the war. It was so important to them that “each family member became a wartime correspondent.” The letters of this family and the importance of writing to each other show that Lewis Parsons was not alone when it came to writing to family members and being homesick.","The letters of soldiers during the war also became very important to the communities as well. The Parsons letters could have been read by the citizens of the town that he was from and not just his family members. Some solders’ letters got sent around to everyone in the town so that the people could know how the war was going or how their friend was doing. In his book, <em>Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama,</em> Walter Fleming says that “letters from the army gave news of the men of the settlement who were in the writer’s company or regiment, and when received were read to the neighbors or sent around the community.” Parsons’ letters might not have been read by the community or the neighbors, but he definitely sent them to his family.

The article explains how Major Anderson of the Union Army had to take down the flag of the Union, and they Confederate flag would soon be raised in its place.

As is the beginning, so will be the end.\" This ending to the article definitely gives a feeling that the South thought they would win the war with ease.","            The battle at Fort Sumter was the start of the Civil War. The shots fired by the Confederates at the fort were the first shots fired in the war. History was completely changed on the day that Anderson surrendered Fort Sumter to the Confederates. Bruce Catton writes in his book <em>The Civil War</em> that \"the bombardment of Fort Sumter was the visible symbol that the war had begun.\" Catton notes that \"Lincoln and Davis had already made up their minds to fight rather than to yield.\" Jefferson Davis did not feel like waiting any longer for the Union to attack first. He was tired of the “peace” and the people of the South were also tired of waiting. David Detzer comments in his book, <em>Allegiance: Fort Sumter, Charleston, and the Beginning of the Civil War,</em> that “peace is always conditional.” Davis was tired of depending on the North to fire shots first. Detzer also states that “wars begin when people consider that the state of peace that exists is no longer acceptable, that war would relieve their problems.” This fatigue of the peaceful status quo could be why the newspaper article sounded so excited about the first battle of the war taking place, and the fact that the fort was surrendered to the Confederacy.  "],"display_date":"April 17, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-17","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5239,"title":"A Soldier Gets Sick","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-17","end_date":"1864-05-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lewis E. Parsons wrote many letters during the Civil War to his family in Talladega, Alabama. Parsons talks about many different things in his letters to home. He mainly asks questions about the home front, and he also talks a great deal about how war is an awful thing. He describes many different situations that he and his fellow men have to go through during the time of war. One of the situations or problems that these soldiers had to face was being sick or getting a disease. Sickness was a very serious problem that many soldiers had to deal with while they were off at war. Parsons does not talk very much about sickness or disease, but he does make one reference to sickness in a letter that he wrote on May 17. He says “I am still having chills and am very weak.” Many soldiers had these same symptoms or feelings that Parsons had. These chills that Parsons takes note of could probably be the symptoms of typhoid fever. The men in the camps started calling the sickness “camp fever”. Many soldiers got sick during the war because of the camps that they had to stay in all the time.","            The camps were very unsanitary, and disease was all around the men because of these unsanitary conditions. Historian Thomas Cutrer wrote about some letters from a Confederate soldier to his wife. The soldier’s name was William Moxley, and he served in the Eighteenth Alabama Infantry during the war. Cutrer tells of how Moxley wrote a lot about the sickness of the soldiers and diseases that they had. The soldiers “never acquired the immunities necessary to fight off even the most common of childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and scarlet fever.” So when the soldiers had to leave their homes to go live in these unsanitary camps they contracted many different diseases. Cutrer also says that a “great interest and value in the Moxley letters is their wealth of commentary concerning the epidemics of disease that shattered both Southern armies and Southern home communities.” These diseases wiped out a huge percentage of both armies during the war. The main disease that was “especially deadly was typhoid.” There were many other diseases and infections that went through these soldiers, but typhoid fever killed the most number of men.","            Another historian by the name of James Pate writes about the letters of the Francis brothers who were soldiers in the Civil War. Pate says that “health issues were a major subject, and outbreaks of measles, mumps, and typhoid fever were routinely reported.” So, Lewis Parsons was not the only soldier sitting in his camp with chills and a feeling of weakness. Every other soldier in that same camp with Parsons probably had some type of sickness or disease. Parsons probably had one of the diseases mentioned above. He did not say in his letter how bad he was feeling, but the sentence he writes does let the reader know that Parsons was sick or on the verge of getting sick. It could have been one of the deadly diseases that were rampaging through both armies."],"display_date":"May 17, 1864","search_date":"1864-05-17","locations":[{"id":13598,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5393,"title":"Armory Square was a military hospital that sprang up in Washington D.C. during the Civil War, from 1862-1865, which recorded unprecedented numbers of soldier casualties and deaths.","course_id":76,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-08-01","end_date":"1865-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While not the first military hospital to open in Washington D.C. during the Civil War, Armory Square Hospital is known for receiving some of the worst soldier casualties from Virginia’s battlefields. Situated nearest the steamboat landing at the foot of Seventh Street, S.W., and the lines of Washington and Alexandria railroad, Armory Square Hospital was the first and only stop for many Union soldiers as the seriously wounded could not afford to travel any farther, according to Martin G. Murray’s article Traveling with the Wounded: Walt Whitman and Washington’s Civil War Hospitals. The Armory Square Hospital Gazette and The National Republican papers reveal that Armory Square Hospital had an unprecedented number of soldier deaths. Notably, “from August 1861 to January 1865, Armory Square recorded the largest number of deaths of any Washington military hospital, 1,339 out of 18, 291 deaths” as recorded in the February 25, 1865 edition of the Armory Square Hospital Gazette (Murray).<br /><br />Armory Square was one of the six “model” hospitals built in Washington D.C. during 1862. Whereas “barracks” hospitals were converted from unused Army barracks, “model” hospitals like Armory Square were specifically made according to the U.S. Sanitary Commission and their recommendation of a pavilion principle (Murray). There were as many as 56 separate facilities used as hospitals in Washington D.C. during the course of the Civil War, and Murray notes that Armory Square was one of 43 in use when it opened in 1862.<br /><br />The Armory Square Hospital Gazette was first published on January 6, 1864. The opening page of the gazette presents the harsh reality of many a soldier’s gruesome fate--it claimed: “the Hospital is an episode in  soldier’s life--sometimes a painful termination of it, which has many an event worthy of a chronicle. Such we propose this paper to be” (“Salutatory”). While recording the deaths of soldiers who died, the gazette also notes soldiers admitted to Armory, returned to duty, transferred to different hospitals, and discharged. <br /><br />As a large hospital tending to those grievously wounded, Armory Square was frequented by a few notable people. President Abraham Lincoln and poet Walt Whitman visited Armory Square, meeting with many soldiers in the hospital ward (Murray). One of Lincoln’s many visits was recalled and recorded by Armory Square nurse Amanda Akin. Whitman also went to many Washington D.C. hospitals and attended to the soldiers. He wrote copious notes about his visits, and on page 18 of his hospital journal he jots down: “In ward G, H, or I, young man I promised to come in and read to--sick with fever--he cannot read steady himself--his hand swerves--take him the paper” (Whitman). However, Whitman writes that he visited Armory Square most often “because it contains by far the worst cases, most repulsive wounds, has the most suffering and most need of consolation--I go every day without fail, and often at night” (Whitman).<br /><br />Armory Square Hospital captures one side of the Civil War, but reveals volumes about the tragedy of the war through the sheer number of men dying from casualties and the hospital’s prominence through multiple visits by President Lincoln and the poet turned nurse Walt Whitman."],"display_date":"August 1862 - January 1865","search_date":"1863-11-01","locations":[{"id":6079,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1228,"tag":"Military Hospitals"},{"id":116,"tag":"Wounded Soldiers"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"ENGL 305: Literary History and Writing","school":"St. Norbert College","course_id":76,"school_id":44}},{"id":5329,"title":"A descriptive entry about a wife of a rice planter during the Civil War.

She resided in coastal South Carolina with her family. She kept a personal diary in which she focused on topics such as her family being ill, historical events, plantation life, her children’s involvement in the Civil War, and her teaching efforts. The entry on May 12, 1862, describes what she endured while she and her family fled their home in the Colleton District of South Carolina due to fear of Union attacks. Margaret was very discouraged and upset. She had to leave abruptly with her family because they expected attacks from Union troops. Many moved from the lower country near the coast to the upper country. Margaret’s family moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina. Residents of the coastal region had to leave in such haste that family members and slaves were left behind. The train stations were more congested than usual, and people were trying to sell their houses. No one wanted to rent their homes, so instead they had to sell the homes for the best price attainable. In the upper country, food prices increased because the storeowners knew that families were desperate and had no other option than to purchase food from them. Margaret was enraged by this increase because she expected businesses to help out and not take advantage of the situation to make bigger profits. Her father had been very ill, weeks prior to the move and was already in Spartanburg receiving care. However with the chaos of the evacuation, there was no one to oversee his slaves and Margaret heard that they had fled to New Hope, South Carolina. Her father was not well enough to organize his own affairs. Margaret was in the process of moving her family and her husband was searching for a place to keep his servants, so they could not help her father. Margaret’s husband, Mr. Grimball did not find a place that was sufficient. If they could not find a place soon, one of their neighbors would allow them to board with her. They agreed to split the rent with her, but they feared that the landlord would raise the price if he knew there would be more tenants. Margaret ends her entry by expressing how sad she was to be leaving, and that their town in the Colleton District, was deserted. She knew that only more bad news would follow.","Margaret wrote her entry about a year after the start of  the Civil War. The war began in April of 1861 and ended in April of 1865. The first shots of the war were fired in Charleston, South Carolina, only sixty miles from Margaret’s home in the Colleton District. The fighting began when the Confederate government demanded that U.S. forces abandon Charleston Harbor, but instead of leaving, U.S. troops moved to Fort Sumter. When the president at that time, Abraham Lincoln, sent in a ship with reinforcements the fort was attacked by and forced to surrender.","People in Colleton District were so concerned about being attacked during the war because they were close to the coast. Being so close to the water made the Colleton District an easy target for Union raids. Ships could come in and land troops nearby with little warning, so Margaret and her family has no choice but to flee. There were a lot of raids and surprise attacks, so it was very likely that Margaret’s family would have been in severe danger if they stayed in Colleton District. Margaret and her family were living in the middle of difficult times, she was in the middle of a war. At any time she or her family could have been hurt. She also had other concerns, like her sons, who were actually in the army and her father who was ill. They had nowhere to stay, but she did not give up, she persevered. She did not allow her circumstances to leave her hopeless. Margaret supported her family and knew that they needed her, she possessed a lot of qualities that many people would not, if they had been in a similar situation."," "],"display_date":"May 12, 1862","search_date":"1862-05-12","locations":[{"id":11488,"lat":32.467984914,"lng":-80.4033249144,"zoom":8,"place":"COLLETON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":749,"tag":"Diary"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1149,"tag":"Wife"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":72,"school_id":43}},{"id":5296,"title":"General Braggs Carries Out Execution of Kentucky Youth","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-12-04","end_date":"1862-12-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At eleven o’clock on the morning following Christmas Day, 1862, General Braxton Bragg of the Confederate Army forced his Company E, 6<sup>th</sup> Kentucky Infantry Regiment (part of the commonly denoted “Orphan Brigade”) to stand round their fellow soldier, Asa Lewis, who awaited execution. Exactly one hour later the firing squad of twelve men carried out the young soldier’s sentence. As Lewis’ body, pierced by eleven bullets, fell to the ground, General John C. Breckenridge was “seized with a deathly sickness,” as a comrade of Lewis recalled, as he similarly collapsed, overwhelmed by the grief of the occasion.","Asa Lewis had enlisted in the Confederacy the year prior to his execution, and despite his lack of training, showed promise with his impressive performance at the Battle of Shiloh. Enlisting early in the war, Lewis had served the entirety of his commitment by December, and though he declined to reenlist, he had remained in Murfreesboro for several months. Perhaps feeling pressure from his regiment and commanding officers, Lewis reluctantly agreed to sign up for another commitment. Following the reversal of his decision not to reenlist, however, Lewis got word that his father had died, leaving his mother and sisters without any male support on their farm that had already suffered the effects of several Union raids. Upon hearing this news, Lewis requested permission to visit his family, but was refused. Viewing his enlistment status as less than explicitly outlined, Lewis left his brigade in the manner of “French leave” on December 4, 1862 for his Kentucky home– with the intent to return after assisting the finances of the women toward whom he felt responsibility. He did not journey far before officials detected his absence, however, and was promptly brought back and issued a warning against further such conduct. Nevertheless, Lewis left once again, was caught, and following the court martial to hear the details of his case, was sentenced to death by a firing squad.","In 1862, still early in the struggle, Confederate military authorities tended to carry out sentences with more leniency than in the latter portion of the war, often implementing punishments of a less severe nature for desertion, such as a period of hard labor, forfeiture of a portion of one’s pay, or being branded as a deserter. As supplies dwindled and morale dropped, the number of desertions increased, and enforcement of the Confederate <em>Articles of War </em>clause regarding the punishment of death for deserters became more rigorous, with Robert E. Lee realizing that their inferior numbers could not take a further toll from absentee soldiers.  Not surprising for this time then, Lewis’ corps commander, General Breckinridge, upon hearing the news of Lewis’ sentence, pleaded with General Bragg to intervene and save the 19 year old from what Breckinridge viewed as murder. Bragg, known for both his resolve to stand firm against the actions of deserters and his contempt for the Kentucky brigade, was unwavering in his determination to make an example out of Lewis. Breckinridge, unrelenting as well, brought a signed petition to Bragg on the day preceding the scheduled execution, displaying the support of all his officers to refer this case to President Davis rather than hastily carry out such a severe sentence. Bragg refused, stating firmly in response to Breckinridge’s appeals, “You Kentuckians are too independent for the good of the army. I’ll shoot every one of them if I have to.”","Through denying any possibility of action that could have stopped the death of Private Asa Lewis, and making a spectacle of the event to Lewis’ comrades and commanding officers, Bragg solidified the abhorrence between himself and the Kentuckians. Moreover, Bragg’s relationship with Breckinridge suffered immensely as a result of this decision, erasing any hope that the pair had of repairing the damage of previous conflicts."],"display_date":"December 4, 1862 - December 26, 1862","search_date":"1862-12-15","locations":[{"id":12343,"lat":35.8476814553,"lng":-86.4046881374,"zoom":9,"place":"RUTHERFORD, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5324,"title":"Brigadier-General Harry T.

Hays was the Brigadier General of the feared Louisiana Tigers.  During the Civil War, the Tigers gained a reputation in the North as one of the fiercest Southern brigades.  The Tigers are best known for their tremendous efforts at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where Hays said they, “advanced through the city of Gettysburg, clearing it of the enemy and taking prisoners at every turn.”","The Confederates had planned on going into the Union to take a northern city and convince Northerners that the fight was not worth it anymore.  But on July 1, 1863, parts of the Confederate army marched on Gettysburg, and found the town to be occupied by more Union forces than they had anticipated.  This began the unintentional confrontation between the two sides, which ultimately resulted in the four-day battle.  That first day in Gettysburg, Hays’ account of the Tigers proves the accuracy of their reputation.  After July 1, Hays felt “satisfied that the prisoners taken in the above-mentioned movements by my brigade exceeded in numbers the force under my command,” where the casualties for the Union, “exceeded ours by at least six to one.”  These extraordinary efforts from Hays’ brigade and others helped to push the Union troops out of the town and onto Cemetery Ridge, where the Tigers performed another incredible task with seemingly little effort.","In the early morning of July 2, Hays moved the brigade onto the base of Cemetery Hill, resulting in skirmishes with Union troops at roughly two a.m.  Despite their inferior position, they managed to hold their ground until approximately eight p.m. when they were ordered to advance up the hill.  Progressing up the hill, the brigade was exposed to Union artillery that, “opened up upon us, but owing to the darkness of the evening, now verging into night and the deep obscurity afforded by the smoke of the firing, our exact locality could not be discovered by the enemy’s gunners.”  Due to the dark and smoke, the Tigers managed to cross a few more Union lines, ultimately reaching the summit, only to see U.S. troops approaching several minutes after their ascent.  Unable to determine the full strength of these troops, Hays moved his men back down the hill, holding that position until the next night when he fell back to his original position at the base of the hill.","The effort that the Louisiana Tigers exhibited in the first two days of battle at Gettysburg is typical of the brute force that came to be expected from Confederate troops.  Hays’ account of the efforts of the Tigers and the strength they possessed seems almost extraordinary, as he reported only 181 casualties for these two days, despite being subject to various artillery fire on their climb of Cemetery Hill.  All of these actions helped solidify their previous reputation as one of the fiercest Confederate brigades and contribute to the South’s initial success at Gettysburg."],"display_date":"July 1, 1863 - July 2, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-01","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":715,"tag":"Military"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5331,"title":"Thaddeus Hyatt Appeals to President Buchanan to Address the Kansas Territory’s Drought","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-02-04","end_date":"1861-01-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Discussion of the Kansas Territory before the Civil War often turns directly to the time period known as “Bleeding Kansas,” which generally refers to the year of 1856 or to its part in the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. These events, however, were not what the citizens of the Kansas Territory were concerned with immediately before the outbreak of the Civil War. In 1860, with the rest of the country absorbed in the presidential election, Kansas suffered through severe drought and famine, to which the Federal government failed to respond. The letters and reports of visiting New Yorker Thaddeus Hyatt to President James Buchanan, detailing the deplorable conditions in the Territory, went largely ignored.","Hyatt penned seventy pages of reports and pleas to Buchanan to send aid to the suffering people of Kansas. Perhaps the most moving of all of his appeals was the final one. He expressed his disgust with the press of the East. While in Kansas, Hyatt had mailed numerous letters to the <em>New York Tribune</em> describing the suffering of Kansas’s citizens, with the hope that, with the publication of the letters, people of the East would have “compassion on the perishing people of Kansas.”","Upon Hyatt’s return to New York he was shocked to learn that only one of this letters had been published. As he discussed in his letters to Buchanan, he was ill from the conditions he witnessed in Kansas, but was even more disturbed by the silence of the press. Hyatt emphasized to Buchanan that since the citizens of the United States refused to help their brethren, the responsibility was placed upon the Federal government. He did not specify what Buchanan should do, only that he should take some sort of action. Of all Hyatt’s statements, the most powerful was that he desired “speedy relief” to “reach a multitude of starving American citizens, even though <em>they cannot vote.</em>”","Here Hyatt revealed an even larger issue of the time. Despite the fact that Kansas had sufficient population to be admitted into the Union in 1860, it still remained a territory. If Kansas had been a state during the drought of 1860, it would have been able to receive “federal resources.” The only action that Buchanan took to aid Kansas was to make a personal donation of one hundred dollars.","The significance of this action, or lack of action, may have contributed to Kansas’s position at the outbreak of the war. The policy of the Buchanan administration towards the drought, despite such reports as Hyatt’s, paved the way for Republican and Constitutional Unionist criticism of the Democratic Party in the 1860 election. The critique by some was that the Democrats had failed Kansas, which increased Union sympathy in Kansas during the war."," "],"display_date":"February 4, 1860 - January 14, 1861","search_date":"1860-07-25","locations":[{"id":4294,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DONIPHAN, Kansas"},{"id":4224,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALLEN, Kansas"},{"id":4541,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"BRECKENRIDGE, Kansas"},{"id":4335,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"GREENWOOD, Kansas"},{"id":4254,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"CHASE, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1131,"tag":"Thaddeus Hyatt"},{"id":1130,"tag":"Kansas Territory"},{"id":1129,"tag":"James Buchanan"},{"id":1128,"tag":"Drought"},{"id":1127,"tag":"Famine"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5332,"title":"Lieber Code Provides Definition and Punishment for Confederate Spies","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-04-24","end_date":"1863-04-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Issued in April of 1863, General Orders 100, also referred to as the Lieber Code, provided the Union Army with clear instructions as to how to deal with captured Confederate soldiers,  as well as non-combatants during the Civil War. Created at the request of Abraham Lincoln, the Lieber Code provided soldiers with rules and expectations for their conduct. The Code devoted an entire section to spies. A spy was defined as “a person who secretly, in disguise, or under false pretenses, seeks information, with the intention of communicating it to the enemy.” Whether or not a spy successfully communicated information to the enemy made no difference in the treatment he or she received. If captured, a spy would be detained, immediately taken to the commanding general, then arrested, and “securely guarded.” Captured spies’ activities were investigated by the provost marshal.","The Lieber Code revealed the complications that spying activities caused both sides of the armies, because it so thoroughly defined a spy, as well as the procedures for his or her capture and detainment. Union and Confederate officials valued intelligence gathering as a vital part of their war strategies. President Lincoln believed that having information about the South’s intelligence was the “hardest nut to crack” in defeating the Confederacy; however, identifying a spy proved difficult. During the war, spies were able to exercise their activities and orders with ease.","Spies for the North and South were mostly English speaking Americans.

Before secession had even taken place, Confederate espionage rings had been established. Most effective was Rose Greenhow’s spy organization, located in Washington D.C.","Military officers from the North also “went south” after secession.

Were I to mention any one in particular it would be but showing injustice to the rest, as each one tried to excel the other in deeds of gallantry and daring.”","Today the Irish Brigade is honored at Gettysburg with the statue of a Celtic cross and a greyhound.  The greyhound is the Irish symbol of loyalty and the statue itself a memorial to the Irish Brigade’s heroism.  It stands as a reminder that despite the prejudices that may have been held against the Irish, when the battle began those who fought did not hesitate to act with valor."],"display_date":"July 2, 1863 - July 4, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-03","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":912,"tag":"Gettysburg"},{"id":759,"tag":"Immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5345,"title":"Timothy Webster Becomes First Spy Executed in the Civil War","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-05-04","end_date":"1862-05-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the day of April 29, 1862, Timothy Webster became the first person executed during the Civil War for acts of espionage. Convicted four days prior to his execution, a court-martial in Richmond, Virginia ruled that Webster, an “alien enemy,” should “suffer death by hanging.” The <em>New York Times</em> republished an original article from the <em>Richmond Dispatch</em> relaying the information of Webster’s capture and trial. Both articles included a “brief synopsis of the proceedings,” which cited Webster’s alleged offenses and the court’s ruling.","The first charge stated that Timothy Webster had been caught on April 1, 1862, “in the service of the United States” lurking “about the armies and fortifications the Confederate States in and near Richmond.” Although the court brought another charge against Webster, they reached a “not guilty” verdict. This second accusation against Webster placed him in Memphis, Tennessee in July of 1861 also around Confederate fortifications. While the burden of proof for the second charge was not strong enough for a conviction, the guilty ruling on the first charge alone sealed Webster’s fate.","In the conclusion of the brief, a fair amount of detail regarding Webster’s final moments provided the reader with a clear picture of the events on April 29. The article went so far as to narrate the malfunction of the first rope used to hang Webster, stating “The half-hung and partially stunned man was speedily raised and assisted up, and a new rope being ready, he was soon swinging, in accordance with his sentence.”","The charges the Confederate court-marshal brought against Timothy Webster at the time of his execution turned out to be only a fraction of the Union spy’s activities. Born in the United Kingdom, in 1821, Webster immigrated to the United States and worked as police officer in New York City. At the war’s onset, he became involved in detective work for the Union, which led to his career as a spy. Part of the new Secret Service ring, Webster was the most valued agent to the organization’s creator, Allan Pinkerton. Prior to his capture, Pinkerton had sent Webster on numerous successful espionage missions to Baltimore. There, he infiltrated the Sons of Liberty group in February of 1861. This, supposedly, led Webster, and subsequently Pinkerton, to a plot in the organization to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.","Webster had also been employed as a double agent. Confederate Secretary of War, Judah Benjamin, used Webster to transport important document to Confederate agents that were across Union lines. With the documents in his possession, Webster made stops before delivering the dispatches allowing Union officials to read the contents of the messages.","When Webster was struck by a case of rheumatism on his mission to Richmond in 1862, Pinkerton sent Union spies Lewis Pryce and John Scully to locate Webster, who had been too ill to relay information back to Pinkerton. The two spies were captured while searching for Webster, and suspicion engulfed the valuable agent.

Among these citizens was a woman by the name Carrie Childers. On September 15, 1863 Carrie Childers of Bolivar, Missouri wrote to Capt. Rowan E. M. Mack in Cassville, Missouri a letter concerning the Rebel activity occurring in her local area. She informs Capt. Mack that guerrillas are razing the homes of the citizens and also committing murders. Her letter to Capt. Rowan E.M. Mack indicates that she knew him personally as later she speaks of her disappointment at his departure for Arkansas. Childers writes (ungrammatically) about the depraved situation and states “I can wright it you may be ashured it is very bad there is a man killed or a House razed evry night by the Rebels.\" Certainly during this time period of the Civil War, the state of Missouri and its citizens were enduring a major battle within its own borders with guerrilla fighters.","     Carrie Childress seems to feel that times will eventually get better although she states even the Union soldiers themselves had to come into the local town to escape the guerrillas. During this period in Missouri, guerrilla soldiers were particularly cruel; they were raping, robbing, beating, and murdering the innocent civilians. Occasionally, they murdered an opposing soldier, scalped him and kept the scalp as a trophy, hanging it off the bridle of their horse. Sights like these would most certainly lead the locals to fear these bands of barbarians. Many of these locals were women who had been left to take care of the home and the children while their husbands were off fighting. Carrie Childress herself praises Capt. Mack for his efforts while away at war, stating “I congratulate you on once more having the opurtunity of invading the Sacred Soil of Arkansas and presume the Rebels will have a hapy time while you are in Arkansas.” The reader assumes that this may be a “while the cat is away, the mice will play” situation for the surrounding area. Without the proper authorities in place to help keep the irregular warfare under control, the situation would have become unbearable for the citizens.","     Michael Fellman, historian of guerrilla warfare in Missouri, reminds his readers that guerrilla warriors were are bands of irregular fighters who have either rallied on their own to form a group or have been fighting separately from any official military association. Guerrilla warfare was a difficult situation in Missouri for the citizens largely due to amount of confusion the guerrillas caused as a result of fighting. Fellman also discusses the conflict the people of Missouri had while trying to cling onto their faith and moral values all while feeling disrespected and violated by the guerrillas and invading armies. There were several major divisions of guerrilla bands that caused such confusion and conflict within these communities. These rebel groups were the raiders, partisans, and bushwhackers. There were also units of Missouri Partisan Rangers formed by the locals to help protect the citizens from the invading Federal troops. Meanwhile the invading Northern troops were also treating the locals savagely and committed horrible crimes, like the massacre at Camp Jackson on May 10,1861 which killed over thirty civilians. There were also Jayhawkers who were guerrillas that were fighting for anti-slavery and also terrorizing the locals in the process. Also many brutal attacks were committed by bands of irregular guerrilla fighters, like the Lawrence Massacre on August 21,1863 led by William Quantrill, which killed close to 200 men and boys, or the Centralia Massacre of September 27,1864, where “Bloody “ Bill Anderson led his band to brutally kill twenty-four unarmed Union soldiers. Reviewing events like these and factoring in all the civil unrest in the area it is not suprising that someone like Carrie Childress would be pleading for hope of a calmer future for her region."," "," "," "],"display_date":"September 15, 1863","search_date":"1863-09-15","locations":[{"id":7847,"lat":37.6164921569,"lng":-93.4005351949,"zoom":9,"place":"POLK, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5397,"title":"Ambush in the Darkness of the Sam Gaty","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-04-04","end_date":"1863-04-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     April 4<sup>th</sup> 1863 at two in the morning the steamboat Sam Gaty stopped on the Independence River at Sibley and was ambushed by band of bushwhackers, that killed fifteen “contrabands” and two other whites. There was a resentment at the Union for the acceptance of the escaped slaves, whom some had been undertaken as labor to the Union forces. \"Contraband\" described former escaped slaves due to the fact that the Union would not return them to their former masters. One of the main motivators of guerrilla warfare during the Civil War was the issue of slavery. When Lincoln issued his emancipation policy and asked the border states to also end slavery, the possibility of slavery coming to an end provoked extreme frustration in Missouri. As the Federal troops began to enter the Border States they encountered Confederate troops and meet resistance bands of irregular soldiers or guerrillas. There were many different groupings of guerrilla warfare; bushwhacker, jayhawker, and partisan. There was guerrilla warfare taking place on the North and South sides, with this being said, it depended where your loyalties lay whether you were a jayhawker, bushwhacker, or a partisan. Jayhawkers were anti-slavery fighting guerrilla soliders, bushwhackers were bands of irregular fighters who hid in dense locations of vegatation in prepration for ambush, and partisans were calvary soldiers who were smart and performed dashing raids on Union troops. Sometimes the bushwhacker had no loyalties to either the North or South and was committing atrocious acts just to be vindictive. Their basic goals were to cause terror, rape, rob, and vandalize the local communities.","     The Smoky Hill and Republican Union Paper in Junction City, Kansas describes how the bushwhackers were strategic in their attack, taking prisoners by name and even knowing where the seventy-six former slaves were being kept on the boat. The attack was led by guerrilla leader George Todd who served under the well-known William Quantrill. The “assassins” took over the boat and also they robbed the passengers of thousands of dollars of personal belongings and money. They also destroyed government property such as freight and employed some of the passengers to help them. The passengers were willing to help if meant to save their lives. Unfortunately not all the passengers met such a fate. The bushwhackers took the “contrabands”, marched them off the boat and lined them up in a row. The paper describes as these “poor, helpless creatures” were shot and fifteen fell dead. Thirteen former slaves did get did away as the men proceeded to go back to pillaging the Sam Gaty but the paper states that later remainder of the “contraband” was killed by these \"inhuman monsters\". (What the paper fails to state is if there were seventy-six contrabands on the Sam Gaty, and fifteen were killed, why does the Smoky Hill Republican Union only headline that fifteen were killed?)","     In any case the Smoky Hill and Republican Union paper does state that this appalling act was certainly one of the worst and would evoke revenge. This was a savage attack on the people of this steamboat and the Union. These bushwhackers, who generally did not take sides on the war, made a major statement with the assassination of these former slaves with ties to the Union. However their main goal was to cause fear and confusion for the opposing troops, and they accomplished that with their attack of the Sam Gaty. The civil unrest in these communities of border states, especially Missouri, during the Civil War was of a large scale, and caused serious turmoil between neighbors and authorities. According to guerrilla warfare historian, Richard Brownlee, the turmoil was also in regards to Missouri’s frustration at being portrayed to Northerners as potential secessionists and parts on North Missouri the state was in \"near anarchy\" because of the increasing strain of conflict. It was difficult for local and state governments to handle the raging situation with guerrilla warfare. Brownlee notes in certain areas of Missouri that some communities disintegrated entirely due to the violence of guerrilla activity. These bands of irregular fighters were motivated and difficult to control and their reputation outlasts them even today."," "],"display_date":"April 4, 1863","search_date":"1863-04-04","locations":[{"id":7633,"lat":39.0084856397,"lng":-94.3460789427,"zoom":9,"place":"JACKSON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5409,"title":"Mr. Guerrilla is Innocence Personified","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-09-06","end_date":"1862-09-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     On Saturday September 6th 1862 an entertaining article was published in The New South paper in Port Royal regarding the antics of guerrilla warfare. This intriguing article describes the operations of guerrilla fighters during the Civil War. Guerrillas during this period fall into several different categories. Partisan, raiding, and bushwhacking are just several of the main focuses of many historians of Civil War guerrilla warfare. Partisan rangers were brilliant Calvary men with quick wit that conducted raids of Union camps causing the soldiers to stay on alert. Likewise the Raiders were bands that had skirmishes with both civilians and military troops, while the bushwhackers were generally men who conducted raids from heavily covered areas of vegetation. Most bands were irregular fighters, not sanctioned by the government however this separated the partisan rangers because they were under the 1862 Confederate Congress Act. Port Royal’s article of 1862 informs the reader how these guerrilla bands would operate. The witty article focuses on the category of raider bands in general.                ","     In our article we look at “Mr. Jones” and his parish in the state of Louisiana. Our article in the New South states “Mr. Jones is a distinguished man in his local community, well known and well liked. He will use his personality to influence the men in parish to follow his lead and rebel against the incoming opposing troops.” From here the influenced party will organize into a small band of fighters, numbering around thirty to fifty-five, into gathering together their local supplies, such as rifles, shotguns, and mounting their horses, riding out to hide in bushes and woods in anticipation of the skirmish to come. They will lie in wait to ambush or sometimes secretly raid the military camps by night. They engage many times in fierce skirmishes with the enemy. If the opposing troops can pursue, they are sent on roundabout chase. These chases usually end up with the guerrilla stashing away the clues to his antics, where then “Mr. Guerrilla” is found sitting on his piazza, philosophically smoking the pipe of peace, with the appearance of innocence personified.”","      In many of the more dangerous raids, there were numerous civilian murders, rape, terrorizing of the locals, and robbery. In any category, guerrilla soldiers were masters of disguise, sometimes dressing in stolen Union soldiers uniforms or women’s clothing to fool the enemy. This led to much confusion as to who they were. In Missouri, bushwhackers were specifically adapted to inducing a state of confusion and the civilians could not tell if they were Confederates or Federals committing such horrible crimes. These guerrilla fighters, regardless of the region of country they were located in, felt justified by fighting by any means necessary for what they regarded as important. Guerrilla warfare historian, Michael Fellman, states that “in such a war, for guerrillas, terror was both a method and a goal.” In the case of “Mr. Jones” and most of the Confederates, they focused on Lincoln and the Northern aggression. Fellman adds that guerrillas demolished homes, supplies, morale, and lives of the citizens around them. There was a danger associated with guerrilla warfare that affected these local American populations that sadly today is overlooked for what is considered mainstream Civil War battles."],"display_date":"September 6, 1862","search_date":"1862-09-06","locations":[{"id":11447,"lat":32.4068445137,"lng":-80.4452215468,"zoom":8,"place":"BEAUFORT, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5443,"title":"\"The Slow Dead March of Camp-Disease\": Death in the American Civil War","course_id":82,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-25","end_date":"1861-11-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Charles Furman had known Fannie Garden for only 13 days before he asked her to marry him. In all, they spent less than a month together before the Confederate government ordered him northward to fight the “soulless soldiers” of the “despised Yankee Nation.\" The letters they wrote in the years that followed captured both their own deepening love and the chaos and carnage of the American Civil War. He was prepared, he wrote, to fight and die to defend her—and to defend Confederate freedom. He was utterly unprepared, however, for the reality of war—for the tedium and toil of daily life, for the savage intensity of battle, and most of all for the sweeping devastation of disease.","In November 1861, his regiment was encamped in northern Virginia. Since the Battle of Bull Run four months earlier, there had been only a few minor skirmishes to distract the men from the weariness of camp life—until now. Union general Daniel Sickles was gathering reinforcements, and Furman expected an attack any day. Responding to the news, Furman wrote to Fannie to assure her that he “love[d] her truly, and deeply, and earnestly—with all the warmth of his nature.” Nonetheless, he asked her not to worry, insisting that what he truly feared was not an instantaneous death in battle but a long, lingering death of disease. The former, he wrote, was like heavy infantry—“brilliant and rapid”—but nothing compared to the “universally destructive cavalry” of disease. Ultimately, he concluded, “the slow dead march of camp-disease is much more to be dreaded than the rapid double-quick of ball and shell.”","In the six months since Furman had enlisted, only eight of the regiment’s 900 soldiers had died in battle, and another 50 had been wounded. In those same months, measles and typhoid fever swept through the regiment, killing 43 and leaving dozens more too weak to fight. By winter’s end another 20 would be dead of typhoid and pneumonia. These losses typify larger patterns of Civil War mortality. In the first year of the war, as soldiers gathered from across the country, measles, smallpox, and other childhood illnesses devastated newly-formed armies. Exposure and nutritional deficiencies left soldiers vulnerable to disease, and the filthy, fetid water that sustained most of their camps allowed dysentery and typhoid to thrive. The Civil War, recent analysis suggests, claimed the lives of upwards of 750,000 Americans. An estimated two-thirds of those deaths—perhaps 500,000—were the result not of battle but disease. Historian Allen Guelzo has estimated that disease killed perhaps 18 percent of the entire Confederate army, and James McPherson argues that the percentage may be even higher. It is little wonder, then, that what Charles Furman feared most in the fall of 1861 was not battle—not bullets or bayonets—but disease."],"display_date":"November 25, 1861","search_date":"1861-11-25","locations":[{"id":14189,"lat":38.5089863052,"lng":-77.2972733849,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE WILLIAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1314,"tag":"Charles Manning Furman"},{"id":1313,"tag":"Typhoid fever"},{"id":1312,"tag":"Disease"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5587,"title":"Sumner Takes Command of The Department of The Pacific","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-22","end_date":"1861-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With hostilities breaking out between Confederate and Union forces in the east, a secessionist uprising in California was feared.  In command of the U.S. Army’s Department of The Pacific, was Col. Albert S. Johnston; an adopted Texan with questionable loyalties. Believing that Johnston posed a risk to Union control in California, General Winfield Scott dispatched Brigadier General E. V. Sumner to replace Johnston as the commanding officer on the Pacific coast.  On March 22, 1861 General Scott wrote to Sumner “Prepare to sail from New York the first of next month to relieve Bvt. Brig.-Gen [A.S.] Johnston, in the command of the Pacific department…” Scott also decided to keep the orders confidential and followed with “The order to sail, ect., will reach you by next mail, but will remain unpublished till you are on the Pacific Ocean, for confidential reasons.”  Despite the secrecy of Sumner’s deployment, word of his coming reached San Francisco a day ahead of him; this did not produce the uprising that Union authorities feared, but allowed Johnston to submit his resignation from the Army.","Upon his arrival in San Francisco Sumner issued the following statement: “In compliance with special order No. 86, dated War Department, Adjunct-General’s Office, Washington, March 23, 1861, I hereby assume command of the this department. All concerned will govern themselves accordingly.”  In a letter to Washington, Sumner described the command being turned over “in good order.” Sumner also commented that even after issuing his resignation, Johnston “continued to hold command, and was carrying out the orders of the government.”  Johnston’s actions were professional and in accordance with the orders of his superiors.

Pettis writes that secessionists were moving to take control of governmental property across San Francisco, ultimately using the military stores in the city to defeat the loyalist citizens.  Pettis claimed that is was the unannounced arrival of Sumner that dashed this plan, forcing the secessionists to delay, and then give up after Sumner consolidated western forces to fortify San Francisco.","Though there was a Secessionist plot afoot in San Francisco, Sumner reported to Washington that there was “a strong Union feeling with the majority of the people of this state.” He claimed that though a minority, the secessionists were “the more active and zealous party, which [gave] them more influence than they ought to have for their numbers.”  Despite the actions and schemes of the confederate sympathizers, California remained fully in support of the Union cause.  Johnson, however, was later named commander of the Confederacy’s western theater; and viewed as one of the best Confederate generals in the war, before he died at the battle of Shiloh."],"display_date":"March 22, 1861 - April 28, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-09","locations":[{"id":967,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":10,"place":"SAN FRANCISCO, California"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5499,"title":"Art of Great Amusement: Life of Confederate States of America Prisoners of War","course_id":92,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-12-29","end_date":"1865-12-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 29<sup>th</sup> 1865, Lafayette Rogan ventured out of the shoddily constructed prison barracks onto the frozen Mississippi River in the bitter cold. In the prison that December, Rogan had seen a side of the Civil War few remember now. He experienced almost a month of weather he described as miserable and intensely cold. To compound matters, adequate clothing and blankets were in short supply. Smallpox had also appeared in the prison again and Rogan remarks “Great suffering is in store for our boys here.” But on this day Rogan hoped to get his mind off his troubles.","Rogan had been imprisoned in Fort Armstrong since December 5<sup>th</sup> 1863. He was kept away from his wife, child and home with little chance of escape or parole. In this prison he watched the men of his regiment succumb to disease, malnutrition and the elements. One winter prior, 232 of his fellow prisoners died in January alone. During the twenty month existence of the prison 1,960 prisoners died. This means one out of every fifteen prisoners at Fort Armstrong perished while being held on the island. While in prison, Rogan also had to deal with the loss of his brother Richard who died right after being promoted to Colonel. Just one month before his December journey out onto the frozen Mississippi, Rogan records in his diary that “The boys are actually killing and eating all dogs that go into the prison. Too bad indeed to be thus reduced.” So what was this man, who had experienced more than his share of hardship and tragedy doing? He was going ice skating.","On December 29<sup>th</sup> Rogan makes the following entry in his diary","“Days in prison are so like each other that they fail to give items to record. The only thing I have had to vary the monotony of to day is some exercise on the ice. I buckled on a pair of scates and tried to learn the art which appears to be one of great amusement.”","As a single entry, in a diary of three hundred and forty one entries, this tiny record of a man’s day reduced to three lines may seem insignificant, and in the scope of the great struggle that was the Civil War it may be. Yet this entry captures one of the biggest challenges prisoners of war faced; boredom.  Rogan’s diary is full of entries describing the repetitiveness and monotony of prison life. Rogan spent much of his time reading. During the course of his captivity Rogan only mentions one work in specific, d'Aubigné’s History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century, d'Aubigné was a French scholar on the Reformation and at the time his work was the leading academic history. Such a scholastic taste in reading material is interesting to note. Yet Rogan and others involved themselves in a multitude of pastimes.","Like other prisoners in the camp, Rogan spent his days carving the numerous mussel shells that were common in the Mississippi. The subjects of these carvings were often objects from nature. Doves, leaves, and fish were common as were rings.These small trinkets were sold when possible, allowing the prisoners to buy things at the store in camp. Rogan talks about his “shirt stud and breast pin business” he operated while in prison. He remarks on August 13<sup>th</sup> “Cash accounts show $2.00 clear profit. Time being out of the question.”","Even through the suffering, Rogan and 10,448 of his fellow inmates survived their stay at Fort Armstrong. Rogan’s actions out in the frozen air on the Mississippi December 29<sup>th</sup> paint the picture of a man who, even when faced with the hellish conditions of the prison, did not despair.  Throughout his imprisonment he kept writing, reading, exercising, and praying. Even with so many lives being cut short around him he never stopped trying to improve himself and he never let the bleakness of his situation dictate his actions. Which is why on that cold December day with “Constant effort” the 34 year old soldier and father taught himself how to ice skate."],"display_date":"December 29, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-29","locations":[{"id":2959,"lat":41.4683061448,"lng":-90.5658101504,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCK ISLAND, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1404,"tag":"Rock Island"},{"id":1403,"tag":"Ft.

Sherman marched a column of troops to relieve men who were believed to be in peril in Knoxville, J.G. Foster was cut off from Sherman by a division of Confederate cavalry under General Joseph Wheeler. Unable to move, Foster telegraphed Major General Gordon Granger, Commander of the Army of Kentucky and the man responsible for running cavalry operations in central Tennessee, requesting assistance. “I am held in check here by the whole cavalry force of Wheeler and Jones,” Foster Wrote, “a force more than equal to the whole command here.” Out maneuvered and cut off, Foster reported that, “So long as the cavalry force is in my front I can do nothing.”  In requesting relief, Foster indicated to Granger that if he moved quickly they “may be able to get Wheeler's cavalry between [them],” enabling them to force the cavalry to fight at a disadvantage as opposed to allowing them to use the hit and run method they preferred.  Understanding that cavalry seldom remained in the same place for long, Foster offered that, “if it withdraws, my cavalry will hang close upon the enemy and do all the damage it can.”","Such was the risk of invading enemy territory, as CSA cavalry rode off on long range raids on Union communication and supply lines, hampering troop movements and intercepting and seizing supplies. As J.P. Dyer outlines in an article on the cavalry operations in the Army of Tennessee, Union forces were required to maintain long lines of communication, which, by their very nature, were vulnerable to attack.  Protection of these lines required a large force of cavalry to patrol the lines and respond to raids as they happened, but even with these cavalry elements, response was not instantaneous.  Southern cavalry out-stripped their Union forces in number and in ability for the majority of the war; even by the close of the war, the forces were at best equal. Without being able to predict where and when the CSA cavalry would strike, Union support lines where constantly threatened.","As Christopher S. Dwyer explains in his article on Confederate raiding strategy, the hit and run tactic of Confederate cavalry stemmed from the CSA armies’ numerical inferiority. Launching lighting fast cavalry raids on Union supply lines and communication bases was an attractive alternative to more costly direct confrontations with larger Union armies.  This method allowed Confederate forces to hit the Union in a way that would remove the source of their strength, whilst engaging them where they were weakest, becoming a hallmark of Confederate combat in the western theater.  It proved to be a most viable combat strategy, allowing fast moving confederate forces to seek out and engage smaller Union elements, cutting them off from support and delaying a large, costly engagement.  It only became obsolete after Grant and Sherman decided to cut their tether to the North, feeding and supplying his army off of the land he crossed, rendering cavalry raids fruitless."],"display_date":"December 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-12-03","locations":[{"id":11922,"lat":36.4842835863,"lng":-83.666033113,"zoom":10,"place":"CLAIBORNE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5595,"title":"Captain Sally Tompkins Defends Top Civil War Hospital","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-09","end_date":"1864-06-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Filling a pressing need for medical services, Sally Tompkins established a hospital after the First Battle of Bull Run that became the best hospital during the Civil War.  Running the hospital was not always easy; Tompkins faced pressure from many people to close down the hospital.  In June of 1864, Dr. Carrington, an inspector of hospitals for the South, filed an order to have the Robertson Hospital closed.  Fed some misinformation, Carrington was under the impression that Tompkins was admitting too many soldiers into her hospital.  In a letter dated June 9, 1864, Tompkins replied, “Dr. Garnett’s endorsement on the morning report of June 5<sup>th</sup> ‘that this Hospital, limited to 19 patients, numbered 44’ was written under a misapprehension of the facts.”  Tompkins was not one to be pushed around.  She was a knowledgeable woman with a strong record to prove it.  Later in the letter, Tompkins states, “I think the register of this Hospital will show as great success in its management of the sick and wounded as any other.  Since the 1<sup>st</sup> of last June, we have had 337 patients and but 8 deaths.  Many of them sent to us were (by the statement of Dr. Garnett made to myself) the worse cases.”  Tompkins understood the vital role her hospital played in the war and did not want to see it closed.","Even as a child, Tompkins tended to those who were ill.  She had a helping heart and desired to put it to good use.  As infirmaries quickly filled after the battle, an intense need for more hospitals arose.  Tompkins knew she could provide a solution, so she asked her friend Judge Robertson if she could use his house to provide medical care to wounded soldiers.  He agreed, and Tompkins readily set to work preparing the building and recruiting staff members.  The first patient was admitted to Robertson Hospital on August 1, 1861.","The hospital was first threatened on September 5, 1861, when the Confederate government ordered that all private hospitals be shut down because some soldiers were faking illness to escape military duty.  Not willing to go down without a fight, Tomkins went to President Davis to ask him to allow her hospital to remain open.  She showed him her carefully kept records to prove her hospital was better than many of the others.  Impressed with her abilities, President Davis appointed her to the position of Captain on September 9, 1861.  This would enable her to keep her hospital open and receive military supplies from the Confederate government.","Her defense of the hospital paid off.  A total of 1,333 patients were treated there, only seventy-three of which died.  This was due in large part to Tompkins’s dedication to cleanliness and strict order.  In a journal article written for <em>America’s Civil War</em>, George Hagerman claimed, “Wounded soldiers coming to Richmond begged to be admitted to her hospital.”  Tompkins was a well respected woman and served an important role as a Captain for the Confederate States of America."],"display_date":"June 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-09","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5606,"title":"<em>CSS Shenandoah</em> Boards Dutch Vessel in the Pacific","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-03-30","end_date":"1864-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 30, 1865 a vessel, thought to be the <em>CSS</em> <em>Shenandoah</em>, overtook and boarded the Hawaiian ship <em>Pfiel</em>, the Dutch captain reported the incident to Union authorities upon its arrival in San Francisco.  The captain wrote “On the 30<sup>th</sup> of March, latitude 3° 53’ N. longitude 167° E. at 6 P.M., [my ship] was brought to under a gun from a vessel of war; hove to, and was soon boarded by a boat, the officers and crew of which were heavily armed.” In an attempt to identify the <em>Pfiel</em> as a Union whaling vessel, and thus a viable target, “One of the officers demanded [the vessels] papers. After scrutinizing them he said we were all right.” Before leaving the deck, the officer “asked [the captain] if he had seen any whale ships on the line, or left any in port Ascension.” When the captain of the <em>Pfiel</em> asked the name of the boarding ship, the officer responded “the English ship Miaima, or Miami.” Then the officer and his crew promptly left, “evidently not liking to be too closely questioned.” The Dutch captain went on to say that though it was dark, he could see that “she was a propeller ship under sail, and [he felt] confidant it was not an English ship of war.” The Commandant of San Francisco’s Mare Island naval yard, reported that “There is very little doubt but what the ship described was the <em>Shenandoah.</em>”","In October of 1864 the<em> Shenandoah</em> launched from Glasgow, Scotland under the guise of a civilian steamer named the <em>Sea King</em>.  Once clear into the Atlantic, the vessel was renamed the <em>CSS Shenandoah</em>, she rendezvoused with Confederate naval forces in the Sea of Madeira, where she refit, rearmed and re-crewed as a  warship in the Confederate Navy.  As a Confederate commerce raider, the <em>CSS Shenandoah</em> circumnavigated the globe while sailing for the North Pacific Ocean, with an ultimate goal of reaching San Francisco, a city believed to be poorly defended.  While deployed across the world, the <em>Shenandoah</em> was responsible for destroying no less than thirty-two Union vessels and their cargos.","The <em>CSS Shenandoah</em> continued to prey on Union whaling ships in the Pacific until rumors that the war was over were confirmed, which it was on August 2, 1865.  Realizing that he had been fighting without cause or state, therefor moving from the category of enemy combatant to that of a pirate; James Waddell, captain of the <em>Shenandoah,</em> set a course to avoid Union ships and surrender on English soil.  According to the Department of the Navy’s Naval Historical Center, Waddell rounded Cape Horn in September, then arrived and surrendered in Liverpool in early November, becoming the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.

Hench, for the purpose of portraying the history, cause, and tragedies that people experienced when infected with the disease. It also contained information for Americans explaining how Yellow Fever originated and what measures the government took to prevent the disease from resurfacing in later years. The article was written after the 1900’s because more information regarding this epidemic became available. Philip S. Hench was a physician at the Mayo Clinic in Cleveland.  He spent his entire life researching and documenting the history of this deadly disease. His collection of research was gathered from one individual, Army Major Walter Reed. It consisted of manuscripts, printed materials, photographs, and artifacts that informed people of how this epidemic spread so widely and caused many deaths.","Walter Reed wanted to research this epidemic. Reed’s theory was that Yellow Fever was transmitted by a mosquito. The first symptom occurred twelve days after the bite took place. The symptoms were severe vomiting and continuous diarrhea. The vomit started off green, then brown, and ended with the color black. A person’s body would be covered in petechis, which are red or purple spots, or broken blood vessels. To prove his theory, Reed asked the U.S. military to set up a team of researchers from different facilities.  Reed worked with Jessie Lazear, a scientist from John Hopkins who helped him with his theory. Shortly after starting this project, Lazear passed away from Yellow Fever. Reed, being upset about the loss of his friend, also may have used the loss as motivation to find a cure for the illness. He then asked the military leadership to start an experimental facility called Camp Lazear. This camp used humans as experiments, which was scrutinized by observers.","Yellow Fever first reached the North America in the late 1668. It was first detected in Central America in 1596. The first epidemic was seen in New York in 1668 and made its way up and down the East Coast. In 1793 Philadelphia had the highest deathrate from the disease; one out of every ten people died. The contagious disease spread quickly. In Louisiana alone 4, 056 lives were lost and $15, 000 was spent caring for this illness. There were a total of 500,000.00 cases in all of America between 1793 and 1900. Peopled infected with the illness thought of it as a visitation of God.","Philadelphia, which was one of the largest cities with 50,000 residents, had the highest death toll of yellow fever. From August to November was when most people were infected and then by the first frost the epidemic was controlled because the mosquito that transmitted the disease were killed. Some explanations that were given as to why Philadelphia was highly affected was that it was a compact city. This meant that houses were built close to each other. Another big factor was being near the Delaware River which was heavily traveled by ships. This is one of the main reasons why the government believed this epidemic entered the U.S. at this location. Since yellow fever originated from Central America and from European countries primarily because of slave trading, the U.S. put into effect quarantine measures to try to lessen the epidemic, by Surgeon General of the Marine- Hospital Service. In April 26, 1894, there were quarantine stations at ports to inspect the treatment of vessels, passengers, crew and cargos.  This helped some from any foreign disease entering the states.","Yellow fever was indeed a mass epidemic that caused many lives to be stricken or lost. It raised the question of government and community action, which in those times, was kept a private manner. To this day, many researchers still question the action that was taken to keep the proper isolation from the sick, quarantine, and care for those incapacitated with this lethal death sentence."," "],"display_date":"November 1, 1875 - December 30, 1900","search_date":"1888-05-31","locations":[{"id":11231,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":403,"tag":"Yellow Fever"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5632,"title":"Governor Curtin Outlines Plan for Continuing Conscription","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-10-25","end_date":"1862-10-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 25, 1862, Pennsylvania governor A.G. Curtin submitted his views and worries on the recent riots that had occurred in Schuylkill County to Secretary of War, E.M. Stanton. He described several scenarios for upholding the draft in the wake of these rioting men without jailing or punishing them. He wrote in the letter, “I think you would get the men more easily than by the use of force. Men unwilling to go, and unable to pay the probable fine, will serve in the army on pay [in preference] to being shut up in prison without pay.” In this way he is tried to get men to fight in the war and meet the manpower demands, rather than waste their talents in jail.","Many men were uneasy about the idea of a draft and, when it was enacted on March 3, 1963; many riots against the draft, like the one in Schuylkill County, erupted. Notably, the Irish were among the most outraged in the face of the draft. They were opposed to helping slaves in any way, but also they were upset that as non-naturalized citizens, they should not be forced to fight if they did not have the right to vote.","Most men did not have the money to be exempted and if they did, the money could be used for different things then getting exempt from the war. For some reasons such as this, the Civil War became known as the rich man’s war. When a man wanted to be exempted from the draft the fine was $300. This is seen when Curtin wrote in his letter to the Secretary of War, “Those who are able to pay the fine will prefer using the money in procuring substitutes. The same limit of the fine will probably regulate the price of substitutes.” Adjusted for inflation, if Union Soldiers wanted to be exempt from the war, they would have to pay an equivalent of $5,454.55 in today’s economy.","In the summer of 1863 more riots broke out in Cass Township in Schuylkill County in central Pennsylvania. The township did not meet its quota for the war effort, which is why the call for the draft happened in the first place. The draft commissioner, Benjamin Bannan could only limit the revolt by crediting the names of soldiers that registered in Philadelphia to Schuylkill County."],"display_date":"October 25, 1862","search_date":"1862-10-25","locations":[{"id":11256,"lat":40.7058168704,"lng":-76.2160113696,"zoom":9,"place":"SCHUYLKILL, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1596,"tag":"Riots"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5621,"title":"<em>CSS Tennessee</em>, Confederate Ironclad Proves itself at Mobile Bay","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-08-05","end_date":"1864-08-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of August 5, 1864, Admiral David Farragut led a fleet of eighteen warships into Alabama’s Mobile Bay. Since the fall of New Orleans in April 1862, Mobile had become the major Confederate port in the Gulf of Mexico, responsible for bringing in blockade runners carrying supplies from Havana.  The result of Mobile’s rise in importance to Confederacy was a rise in the priority of its capture for the Union.  Farragut’s fleet consisted of four heavy ironclads, vessels outfitted with heavy iron or steel armor-plates, and fourteen wooden warships, including the <em>U.S.S. Hartford</em>, Farragut’s command ship.  In opposition to this fleet, the Confederates only had four vessels.  However, this included the <em>C.S.S. Tennessee</em>, a ship that was renowned as the most powerful ironclad afloat.  CSA Secretary of the Navy S.R. Mallory described the two forces in a report to Jefferson Davis, dated November 5, 1864. “A formidable fleet of the enemy, consisting of eighteen ships, including four ironclads, mounting 199 guns, crewed by 2,700 men, under Admiral Farragut, crossed the Mobile Bar, where they were vigorously attacked by the forts and by our small squadron under Admiral Buchannan.”","Despite a valiant defense, the Union fleet pushed into the bay, forcing their way past the CSA forts, fleet, and mines.  Mallory reports, “In this action, the <em>Tennessee</em> and the <em>Selma</em> were captured, and the <em>Gains</em>, in a sinking condition was run ashore.”  The secretary totaled Confederate losses at “12 killed, 20 wounded, and 243 taken prisoner,” writing to Davis that, “Naval history records few contests between forces so unequal in ships, guns, and men, and but few in which the weaker side displayed such heroism.”","Beyond the battle’s importance to the Union campaign in the South, Mobile Bay proved to be the first test of the new ironclad against heavy fire. Mallory described the assault of the Federal fleet on the CSA ironclad. “The enemy ships, some of the finest afloat, were armed with IX, X, XI and XV inch guns, whose projectiles varied in weight from 84 to 428 pounds. Their broadsides, some of the heaviest known, were discharged upon the <em>Tennessee</em> at distances ranging from 3 to 30 yards, and three of their heaviest ships, fitted as rams, ran into her at full speed repeatedly.” In defiance of such punishment, Mallory claimed “The massive strength of the frame and the sloping armor of the ship resisted these assaults, and but one shot reached or made any impression upon the woodwork of the shield, and this did not go through it.” This test, as well as the success of the Union Ironclads running under the guns of CSA forts, demonstrated that, as the secretary put it, “The resistance offered by inclined iron armor to the heaviest ordinance ever used upon the sea was here fully tested at short ranges,” proving the durability of the new vessels and the success of advancing naval technology, in both offensive and defensive capacities."],"display_date":"August 5,

of military service led her to lend her talents during the Civil War.  On July 31, 1861, Tompkins opened Robertson Hospital in Richmond, Virginia.  In order to keep the hospital running and secure government funding, Jefferson Davis appointed Tompkins Captain of a Confederate cavalry unit.  In an article written for a website, Ron Maggiano stated, “Carrying her Bible and medicine bag, she spent

August 10, 1835 in Newbern, North Carolina, William Henry Singleton lived anything but an ordinary life. He was born unto a slave woman by the name of Lettis Singleton and a white man, his master John Singleton’s brother. The Singleton’s owned the largest Plantation in Craven County North Carolina and were a family of high social standing in the community. Having William around created a great deal of tension between the master and his brother, with the child serving as a living reminder of his brother’s indiscretion. Even before he knew how to walk, Singletons fate had been sealed.  Slave children were cared for by an elderly slave during the day while the able bodied slaves worked in the fields picking corn, potatoes and cotton. One day, a strange man and slave woman entered the central House. The man offered William a piece of candy and then took him without warning. He was taken to Atlanta, Georgia. He was four years old.","He had been purchased by a widow who ran a slave farm, a place where slaves of good backgrounds were taught skills to increase their market value. He was used mostly to run errands, and was whipped by his master if he did not return in what was an undisclosed acceptable amount of time. He remained there for three years, until he ran away after his mistress went to fetch the twigs and branches she used to discipline her property. He hitchhiked back to Newbern, hoping stage coach then walking back to his plantation only to find his mother and live in a potato cellar for three more years. He was found again, betrayed by his hunger. He would be sold two more times before he was freed.","It’s incredible how a man once beaten for opening a book, could live such an extraordinary life.  He met Abraham Lincoln at the headquarters of General Ambrose Burnside.  He would found an all African American Regiment of the Union Army, the 35<sup>th</sup> US Colored Infantry, serving with distinction and honorably discharged following the Union victory. He found peace and his place teaching the word of God, preaching all over the Northeast.

Morgan had lived in virtual freedom, but was never formally emancipated by the Ashmore family. In accordance with Pennsylvania’s Law of 1826, Prigg took Morgan before a county justice for a hearing at which the justice declined cognizance of the case. Despite this ruling, Prigg had Morgan and her children abducted back to Maryland. Prigg was charged and convicted in 1839 by the state of Pennsylvania with kidnapping under the Pennsylvania Law of 1826 which prohibited the removal of African Americans from the state with the intention of enslaving them. This law directly contradicted Maryland and Federal law, questioning the authority of the Constitution and Congress; therefore, the case was brought before the United States Supreme Court in 1842."," ","At this time, states’ rights tensions were brewing. While abolitionists were pushing for the federal government to outlaw slavery, slavery states did not think that the federal government had the jurisdiction to do so. Eight of the nine justices of the Supreme Court voted to reverse the original conviction and held the Pennsylvania Law of 1826 unconstitutional under both the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, strengthening federal power and weakening state power. While this was a win for slave states, at the same time, this ruling limited states from passing legislation in areas that conflicted with the Constitution- an issue that led to the secession of the Southern states. The result of this ruling sent Morgan and her children back into bondange.

White’s letter began with an explanation of how grateful he was to have received mail from his wife: “[I] contented myself by reading your welcome letter which afforded me great pleasure.” A few lines later, Mr. White proceeded to explain the horrors of the Battle of Sharpsburg (Antietam), which he had been involved in a few months earlier.","In his description of the Battle of Sharpsburg, White wrote, “Oh Mat it","almost makes [me] shudder to think of it how…Sept. 17 ’62 [will] live in the memory of the 32 Va. reg[iment] & its friends.” Despite all the carnage and devastation of the battle, White walked away unharmed. He viewed his survival as an act of God: “Thanks be to a kind Providence I came out unhurt but narrowly escaped. A ball passed [only] through my blanket between my body and right arm.”","The heart of White’s letter, however, is found in the remarks he made about coming home for Christmas. White acknowledged his wife’s plea for him to “get a pass to come to Mothers in the Chris[t]mas.” In response to her plea, Mr. White wrote, “I am sorry to tell you to do either [find a substitute or go home] is utterly impos[s]ible.” Although he hinted at the fact that he wanted to be home for Christmas, White understood that he had a commitment to the Confederacy. Since Mr. White was on “picket duty” in Fredericksburg and was expecting the city to be shelled by the Union forces, he had to abruptly end his letter.","White’s fear of the memory of the Battle of Sharpsburg had a lot of merit. As historian James McPherson pointed out, Sharpsburg was the site of some of the Civil War’s hardest fighting. Just as White had hinted, at nighttime on September 17, 1862, Confederate military leaders reported losses greater than fifty percent in several brigades. In addition, President of the Maryland Historical Society, Burton Kummerow, noted that about 23,000 soldiers were killed and wounded during the Battle of Sharpsburg. In regard to White’s fear of how the day would be remembered, Kummerow argued that it would forever be seen as a victory for the Union, and it eventually prompted Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Historian Stephen Sears also argued that the perceived Union victory at Sharpsburg compounded with the Emancipation Proclamation, prevented Britain, France, and other foreign agents from getting involved in the Civil War.","Aside from the Battle of Sharpsburg, White’s letter reflected emotions shared by soldiers on both sides during the Civil War. The Civil War proved to be more than just a few short battles. The physical and emotional stresses brought about by fighting, such as that at Shapsburg, gave every man a strong desire and longing for home, especially around the holidays."],"display_date":"November 30, 1862","search_date":"1862-11-30","locations":[{"id":5992,"lat":39.4722539212,"lng":-77.3980976361,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":669,"tag":"Confederate Army"},{"id":1792,"tag":"Antietam"},{"id":1793,"tag":"Virginia Infantry"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5770,"title":"Susan Blackford Agreed to Take Up Nursing","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-07-08","end_date":"1861-07-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 08, 1861, Susan Leigh Blackford wrote to her husband, a lieutenant who served in the Confederate army to inform him she was not “at father’s all day sewing for the [Confederate] soldiers,” her regular daily activities, but writing for a special occasion. Blackford agreed to open a local Ladies’ Hospital for injured soldiers with another woman, Mrs. Otey. Nineteenth century women were not allowed in the hospitals of soldiers; however with the establishment of a Ladies’ Hospital, the army would not have to pay for a female nursing staff, nor the extra care wounded men would receive once they were removed from the battlefield. The dedicated Susan Blackfield ended her letter with an explanation that she agreed to help only in so far as she believed her husband approved and that the woman setting up the hospital, Mrs. Otey, was pleased to work with her.","As nineteenth century war-time medicine shifted to modern techniques, organizations formed to ease the transition and extend the life of  injured soldiers. According to historian James McPherson, both Union and Confederate women were allowed to nurse the sick and injured in their homes. However, women were not allowed in military hospitals due to the unsightly and grotesque wounds of soldiers. The United States Sanitary Commission, created by women in 1861, offered charity to the military and began creating hospitals that allowed female nursing staff. Dale C. Smith, author of <em>Military Medical History</em>, claimed the U.S.S.C. “mobiliz[ed] the existing medical profession by providing consultations, transportation, and supplies.”","Susan Blackfield was a conventional southern woman; she sewed items in need for the Confederate soldiers, she was loyal to her husband, and she was willing to help the Confederate soldiers receive further medical aide after they were picked off the battlefield. Blackfield was only one of thousands of Union and Confederate women that was engaged in this type of nursing field work. As southern women felt that sewing uniforms and flags were not enough to help their military men survive, they went from needle and thread to needle and morphine to try and better the chance of Confederate survival. <br /> <br />"],"display_date":"July 8, 1861","search_date":"1861-07-08","locations":[{"id":13657,"lat":37.3167903952,"lng":-79.5201576467,"zoom":9,"place":"BEDFORD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":60,"tag":"letters"},{"id":1796,"tag":"General Lee's army"},{"id":1797,"tag":"nurses"},{"id":1798,"tag":"Susan Blackford"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5773,"title":"A Pennsylvania Private Defends the West Wood at Antietam","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-09-17","end_date":"1862-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Private Milton S. Lytle of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania joined the Union Army in August of 1862, and found himself assigned to Company C of the 125<sup>th</sup> Pennsylvania Infantry in the Army of the Potomac. On September 17, 1862, he and the 125<sup>th</sup> Regiment marched through the East Woods during the Battle of Antietam to protect the artillery batteries supporting Union assaults. Lytle and the rest of the 125<sup>th</sup> Infantry eventually charged past the cornfield where so many would die that day and took up a position near the Dunker Church. In his diary, the private noted that they held the position exposed and without any supporting regiments. Lytle wrote that the enemy came at them with “fearful odds…[and] advanced in solid columns pouring their balls among us.” The Pennsylvania volunteers repelled four attacks before they were forced to retreat. They then charged into the West Wood and battled enemy troops from Georgia and South Carolina before retreating again. At about nine o’clock in the morning, the 125<sup>th</sup> Regiment took up position to protect an artillery battery, and remained there for the rest of the battle. Over the course of the fighting, the 125<sup>th</sup> Pennsylvania Regiment lost thirty-three percent of the troops it fielded that day. Such heavy casualty rates were common at the Battle of Antietam.","Up to that point, the Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest day of the war and had the most casualties of any single day. Over 20,000 Confederate and Union soldiers lay dead following the engagement. According to historian James McPherson, twice as many soldiers died on September 17, 1862 than in the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Spanish-American War combined. The troops fell hard and quick throughout the day due to artillery support and powerful rifle volleys. Private Lytle reported that he saw one Confederate soldier who had died in the act of reloading and still held the cartridge to his mouth. He wrote in his diary that it was common to see corpses frozen mid-action.","General Robert E. Lee was attempting to drive his Army of Northern Virginia into Union territory to dispirit its citizens. According to Lytle, the Maryland Campaign succeeded in that respect when it caused “great alarm in Pennsylvania” and a Union general to call for reinforcements. However, General Lee surprised everyone the next day by retreating “to a land where treason finds more favor.” This strategic victory gave President Lincoln the perfect opportunity to release his Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in occupied Southern territories. His decision to do so following a victory increased the chances that the public would accept such a move. From the European point of view, it tied supporting for the South to support for slavery, a position that was very unpopular in Great Britain and France. However, the battle also served as yet another reminder that this war would be neither easy or quick."],"display_date":"September 17, 1862 - September 18, 1862","search_date":"1862-09-17","locations":[{"id":6079,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1804,"tag":"Battle of Antietam"},{"id":1805,"tag":"Maryland Campaign"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5785,"title":"Surgeon Matt Turner Writes Letter of Hope and Worry to Home","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-27","end_date":"1863-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Assistant surgeon to the 22<sup>nd</sup> regiment of Alabama Infantry, Matt Turner wrote a letter to his mother on May 27, 1863, speaking of his weariness in waiting to hear news from home. He served on picket duty for the past three weeks, but was now managing the Wither’s Division hospital in Shelbyville, Tennessee. Turner found working at the hospital comfortable, although he spoke of the continuous changing circumstances that were a part of military life. He wrote, “… though everything is so uncertain in the army that I am never surprised or disappointed at anything that ‘turns up’.” Turner also mentioned both his uneasiness and his confidence about the war effort. With the siege of Vicksburg having started only nine days before this letter was written, Turner wrote of the ongoing battle, “We are all looking with anxious eyes toward Vicksburg and feel as if a speedy peace will follow the sweep of our arms at that place.” With confidence in the Confederacy, he continued on, “I feel that it is impossible for Grant to extricate himself from his present hazardous condition and, with the reinforcements we have already sent on, [Grant] must be ‘cut to pieces’ or captured. May we not hope that the beginning of the end is near?”","Vicksburg was one of the longest battles of the United States Civil War, lasting from May 18, 1863, to July 4, 1863. Union General Ulysses Grant laid siege to the city on May 26, 1863. Turner, like many Confederates, knew the importance of Vicksburg in turning the tide of the war. Vicksburg sat along the Mississippi River, which was essential to northern military and commercial interests. Furthermore, the River split the Confederacy into an eastern and western half. Gaining control of this waterway was of paramount strategic importance for the Union; this would prevent CSA soldiers and supplies from moving across each side of the Confederacy. If the city did not fall, the Confederacy might win the war, and Turner was optimistic of this outcome. The Siege of Vicksburg lasted forty-seven days. Union casualties totaled 9,362 men and Confederate casualties 29,500 men. In a decisive victory, the Union managed to gain control of Vicksburg.","As an assistant surgeon in the war, Turner was a valuable resource, for he could attend to the wounded with care. Historian Harold Straubing wrote of doctors, nurses, surgeons, and others in the medical field at that time, “They dealt with the soldiers, the wounded, the diseased, and the dying. They were never too far behind the fighting front lines, often in the battle itself as forces crisscrossed the same land.” On both sides, these men and women were unsung heroes. They attended to the wounded and were often placed into the heat of battle in service to their respective country. Much of what is known in the medical industry today can be attributed to the impact of Civil War doctors, surgeons, and nurses, such as Matt Turner."," "],"display_date":"May 27,

woman had to deal with struggles of their own and changes to their lives while their men were away at war.  Many women took on new jobs that they had never had to do before.  The average women of the Civil War took on many new roles in order to survive and help out with the war.  Some women openly supported the war and joined in where they could while others openly rebelled against it.","A young woman named Rachel Cormany was married to Samuel Cormany and had recently moved to the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, from Canada right before the start of the Civil War.  After her husband went off to fight in the war Rachel documented her daily life in a diary.  Rachel’s diary often talked about her daily activities during the war, and she talked of the town’s struggles and her own while the war was going on.  She was a new wife who was not used to managing household affairs and taking care of a family all on her own.  Hunting was one thing that was new for Rachel but it was one of the few ways she could go out and provide food for herself and her daughter.  Every day was a fight for her own life as well as the life of her young daughter.  Rachel’s town was in the middle of the war path and they were often frequented by the southern rebels coming through town to terrorize shop owners and families.  They often kidnapped people and left people for dead when coming through town.  Wives and children were told to lock themselves in their house and hide from sight in order to stay safe.  Rachel often speaks of the daily fear she went through, as well as her depression and concerns for her husband.  She spoke of lying in bed at night and hearing flying shells and bullets while she thought of her husband and hoped he was okay.  When the rebels traveled through her town the mail services often stopped and long periods would pass when she would not receive letters from her husband so the wait would stress her to no end.  Even while living in this fear daily personal lives would still have to continue as normal and the laundry would still need to be done, the children tended to as well as all the other household chores.  Religion was a major way that Rachel would try to maintain her sanity during the war and at times when she was not able to go to church due to the rebels being in town, she would sit and read passages and say her prayers for Samuel’s safety.  Rachel may not have obtained an official job but she had to do many jobs in her home life that she did not have to do prior to the conflict.","While Rachel stayed home to tend to her family’s daily needs, other women joined the war to help by becoming nurses, relief workers, or even serving as soldiers.  During the war a large number of women volunteered to become nurses during the war.  They tended to the victims and witnessed up close the horrible injuries obtained during the fighting’s.  The war relief workers would do jobs such as sewing new clothes for the soldiers to wear and they would also gather medical supplies, food and even bedding for the men of the war.  During the Civil War over 400 women disguised themselves and serves as soldiers and some even fought in the battles of Gettysburg, and Antietam.  These women would have to dress up and disguise themselves as men in order to fight, and many held their own and fought in great battles during these times.  After the wars these women often returned to their normal roles as housewives and mothers.","Rachel stuck to her job in the household during the war and kept a home for herself and her child so that Samuel could return home to the house he had left at the beginning of the war.  She often wrote about the possibility of leaving her home to get away from the rebels but was always scared that Samuel would return home and she would not be there.  She stuck through some very hard times during the war and did things she never had to do before as well as maintained her fight on the home front. Women played all sorts of roles during the Civil War and no one role was more important than the others.  The war was a very difficult time for most people and everyone put forth a fight to survive including the women of the Civil War."],"display_date":"1861 - 1865","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":11033,"lat":39.9274533048,"lng":-77.7212153562,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5780,"title":"Father Abram Joseph Ryan Pens \"The Conquered Banner\"","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-06-24","end_date":"1865-06-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Abram Joseph Ryan was a catholic priest, poet, and strong believer in the Confederate cause. He wrote \"The Conquered Banner\" shortly after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox in 1865. The poem first appeared in the <em>New York Freemen</em>, a pro-Confederate newspaper, on June 24, 1865. Ryan never officially joined the Confederate Army, but, according to historian David O'Connell, he worked as a free-lance chaplain for Confederate soldiers. Although he was born in Maryland and worked in New York and Illinois in the years leading to the Civil War, he left his congregation for the South when the war started.","The main theme of the poem was the lost cause that the Confederate's had become. Ryan treated the Confederate flag as a metaphor for the cause, writing lines like \"furl that banner, for it is wear\" and \"touch it not, unfold it never.\" Ryan made it clear that the thought that the Confederate ideals were correct and noble, but their defeat meant that they should never be pursued again. He instructed southerners to put the flag, and the idea of the Confederate States of America, behind them and leave them there. This view is best seen in the final line of the poem, \"for its people's hopes and dead.\"","The poem also served as a tribute to the men who died defending the Confederate national flag and the Confederacy. As a Catholic priest, Ryan clearly mourned the lives lost for a mission that ended in defeat. His sympathy for these men is seen in lines such as \"love the cold, dead hands that bore it\" and \"for it droops above the dead.\" Ryan had probably formed relationships with hundreds of men while working as a chaplain and had a brother (who was also a Confederate priest) who died during battle in 1863.","According to historian John McGreevy, the poem became one of the most popular of the post-war era and made Ryan famous. Southerners sympathized with Ryan and recognized that their cause had ended in defeat. The poem proved to be timeless, as it remained popular in the South through the turn of the century. According to southerner and historian Hannis Taylor, generations of schoolchildren in the South learned and recited the poem. Taylor summarizes the impact of the poem on the South by saying, \"Only those who lived in the South in that day... can properly estimate its power.\""],"display_date":"June 24, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-24","locations":[{"id":12156,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5781,"title":"A Union Journalist Expresses Fear of British Invasion","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-31","end_date":"1862-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Civil War, the Union and Confederate governments both knew the potential impact that Britain's military force could have on the outcome of the conflict.

The British upper-class would have allied with the Confederacy because they were dependent on its exportation of cotton. They also viewed the American Civil War much like their own class conflict at the time. The South stood for aristocracy and privilege much like the British elite. The North identified with ideals such as popular government and equal rights, which were supported by many working-class people in Britain.","According to historian Norman Ferris, war between the U.S. and Britain was a possibility in the fall of 1861, when on November 8, a U.S. naval officer, Captain Charles Wilkes, took control of a British mail ship and seized two Confederate diplomats. Britain took offense to this and demanded a formal apology from the United States. This event came to be known as the <em>Trent </em>Affair and created tensions between the Union and Britain that led many, including the journalist, to believe a war would occur. Before the end of 1861, the conflict in the relation between the United States and Britain ended peacefully when President Lincoln released the diplomats and condemned the actions of Captain Wilkes. Referring to the event and writing in retrospect weeks after the affair concluded, the Pittsburgh-based journalist wrote \"the British government was determined to be dissatisfied,\" looking for any reason to go to war with the Union. Although, Lincoln ended the affair peacefully, the journalist thought this type of conflict was what Britain had been waiting for.","Although the journalist viewed the <em>Trent </em>Affair as a political move by Britain and believed they would soon declare war, the aftermath of the diplomatic resolution between the Union and Britain actually dealt blows to the Confederacy. According to historian Charles Hubbard, the Confederacy had hoped for diplomatic recognition from Britain. The peaceful end to the <em>Trent </em>Affair took attention away from the potential recognition and ensured that Britain would remain neutral for the remainder of the war. Even though the journalist was probably wrong in his survey of British diplomatic intentions, his opinion demonstrates how the Union feared and expected British military intervention."],"display_date":"January 31, 1862","search_date":"1862-01-31","locations":[{"id":10816,"lat":40.468833638,"lng":-79.9812076782,"zoom":9,"place":"ALLEGHENY, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1820,"tag":"Trent Affair"},{"id":155,"tag":"Great Britain"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5783,"title":"One Man’s Death Wish Due to the Slave Law of Kansas","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-06-06","end_date":"1856-06-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1855, Senator David Atchison of Missouri said, “Mark every scoundrel among you that is the least tainted with free-soilism, or abolitionism, and exterminate him…[e]nter every election district in Kansas . . . and vote at the point of a Bowie knife or revolver!” according to historian James McPherson.

The Slave Law Act managed situations ranging from free people who violated the Law Code (who were sentenced to die) to those who aided, concealed, and/or  rescued slaves who also deserved a death penalty. Furthermore, those who printed indecent documents or helped minorities print indecent documents were penalized accordingly, and finally those who opposed slavery and were forced to sit as a juror to any violation to the above clauses.

Blackford explained his troops had made progress on the line despite the lack of engagement from the Union. Not far from Blackford’s soldiers, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson’s troops had implemented a vital military mission to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad lines. “Burning bridges and tearing up tracks retard the movements of the enemy,” commented the lieutenant, “but not burning up a depot, or the houses of the railroad employees.” The lieutenant explained that although the majority of citizens working in the railroad depots were Union, the men remained silent while the army destroyed the railroad lines.","Railroads, for northern and southern states, provided an expansive consumer market that was not available with wagons. Rail lines like the Baltimore and Ohio were originally laid to economically connect the valley lands with rail lines that were already laid in the North in order to provide a reliable shipping industry. According to historian James McPherson, “With the cash from sale of [crops, customers] bought food and clothing and hardware previously made locally or by themselves but now grown, processed, or manufactured elsewhere and shipped in by canal or rail.” In conjunction to connecting the areas, the rates for shipping by rail was cheaper than shipping by wagon; many citizens used wagons to haul their excess merchandise (crops, clothing, etc.) to rail stations and then shipped the merchandise on rail lines.","The destruction of a segment of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad had military and symbolic importance to the Confederate Army. McPherson wrote, “President John W. Garrett of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was a firm unionist and offered the railroad’s facilities to carry troops and supplies from the west.” During raids of the railroad systems, the Confederate Army often gained railroad equipment for their own damaged lines; what could not be carried, the Confederate troops destroyed and burned to ensure the Union could not refurbish the damaged pieces.

Their final destination was Roanoke Island, North Carolina. Due to sea sickness and stormy weather, the regiment anchored at Hatteras Inlet until January 26, where they departed for Pamlico Sound and remained there until February 5. The regiment invaded Roanoke Island on February 7. Their first orders were to scout and set out pickets. The weather was damp and dreary for the regiment’s first night on the island. Lieutenant Colonel Albert Maggi described the conditions in a letter to Brigadier General Frank Reno, “We stood all night without fire, and raining all the time. None of the men slept, and every half hour I made the companies fall in with the greatest silence. All officers and men of the regiment, without exception, comported themselves with remarkable patience and endurance…”","Four batteries, seven gunboats, and 3,000 Confederate soldiers protected the island, all under the command of General Henry Wise. Before the Union assault, Wise urged Richmond to send more troops but received no answer. On February 8, Lieutenant Colonel Maggi led the men into battle. The <em>Barre Gazette</em> newspaper wrote of the colonel, “In the opinion of the Twenty-First, a braver and better officer for our leader don’t exist [sic].” According to a report in the <em>Barre Gazette</em>, the 21<sup>st</sup> regiment fired nearly forty rounds of cartridges before charging a heavily defended Confederate three-gun battery. The newspaper stated, “When within one hundred yards a charge was made by the Twenty-First, which seemed to be a terrible moment for the enemy, who commenced the firing more fierce than ever.” Soon afterwards, the island was in control by Union hands. Lieutenant Colonel Maggi wrote of his men’s bravery, “I am glad to say that I never saw any better behavior, by any soldiers, young or veterans. I do not believe that it was possible… that any one [sic] could surpass the brilliant and gallant conduct of all my command.”","An estimated 7,500 Union troops stormed the island against a 3,000 man Confederate force. The Union lost thirty-seven men killed in action with 214 wounded. The Confederates lost twenty-three men with sixty-two wounded before surrendering the 2,675 man force. Although the casualties inflicted were small compared to later Civil War battles, such as Gettysburg or Shiloh, the battle boosted Union morale. Union victories at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson followed only a few days after the Battle of Roanoke Island. In the early stages of the war, the Union planned to capture or disable coastal defenses and ports in the Confederacy. Capturing Roanoke Island facilitated the Union by gaining control of waterways leading to inland areas of the South, bringing the Union one step closer towards the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia.

Colfax argued that the failure to create legislatures delayed the process of reconstruction in all states, and continued to postpone the process despite the change of the President from Lincoln to Johnson, and the opening of the Thirty-Ninth Congress. “Every State shall be guaranteed a republican form of government,” Colfax argued, to ensure Congress “is the only law-making power of this land.” He ended the speech by declaring his “policy of reconstruction” was the policy that Andrew Johnson used in his Vice President platform between June of 1864 and May of 1865: “Loyal men shall govern a preserved Republic.”","New Reconstruction ideas and the death of President Abraham Lincoln provided a challenge for a fractured nation suffering from war-time damage. When the war-hero President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 11, 1865 by Southerner John Wilkes Booth, Vice-President and former-slave owner, Andrew Johnson, was left to fill Lincoln’s shoes in the White House. As President of the United States, Andrew Johnson used the term “restoration” instead of “reconstruction” which, as historian Eric Foner argued, “suggested that on the rights of the States, Johnson was likely to be unyielding.” With the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December of 1865, slavery officially ended and seceded states had to accept the Thirteenth Amendment into their state constitutions to re-enter the Union. Replacing slavery in the South was a set of laws known as the Black Codes, which “defin[ed] the status and rights and regulat[ed] in many respects the lives of the freed people.” A Civil Rights Act, drawn up in 1866, declared that all people born in the United States were citizens, similar to Colfax’s speech in May. The Act would return the rights of citizens that were robbed by the discrimination in the Black Codes. The United States desperately tried to balance the repercussions of Andrew Johnson’s leniency towards the South while reconciling the death of America’s beloved President Abraham Lincoln.","Schulyer Colfax spoke about the reconstruction policies that he, past President Lincoln, and the people of Indiana (and the nation) supported. The new policies of Andrew Johnson were not the policies that Johnson used when he ran as Vice President to Lincoln. The speech of Colfax was a warning to Andrew Johnson and the nation that Colfax did not support his policies; Johnson’s acceptance of the Black Codes was a disgrace to the Freedmen of the United States, and his unwillingness to support laws to extend full legal citizenship to Freedmen was disgraceful as President. The reprinting of Colfax’s speech in a small town’s newspaper in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania spoke to the nationwide belief that Johnson’s reconstruction policies were distasteful."],"display_date":"May 2, 1866","search_date":"1866-05-02","locations":[{"id":11058,"lat":40.4169896434,"lng":-77.9812660431,"zoom":9,"place":"HUNTINGDON, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1834,"tag":"Schulyer Colfax"},{"id":1835,"tag":"Andrew Johnson"},{"id":1836,"tag":"Speech"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5792,"title":"<strong>A Poet Describes the Horrors of a Civil War Hospital</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-12-01","end_date":"1892-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In his poem <em>A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown</em>, Walt Whitman described one of the most haunting memories of his medical career: “Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all, / Faces [<em>sic</em>], varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, / some of them dead, / Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, / the odor of blood, / The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd.” The setting of Whitman’s nightmare was an impromptu field hospital likely located somewhere near a battlefield. Whitman’s poem poignantly explained the horrors that one could find at field hospitals during the Civil War: “Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made, Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps, And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke, By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down.”","The field hospitals were a horrifying sight for Whitman. This is surprising, in many ways, since Whitman served as a nurse during the Civil War.  For Whitman, the field hospitals lacked sufficient space for all the wounded soldiers in their care.  They reeked of blood and other odors. Not to mention, they presented endless labor for the surgeons and their assistants, who did everything in their power to end the suffering of the wounded and dying soldiers. What Whitman saw in the field hospital haunted his memories the rest of his life.","Nightmares, like the one experienced by Whitman, were common at field hospital during the Civil War. Because field hospitals were the quickest and most efficient source of medical care throughout the years of the war, they existed at essentially every battlefield. In a piece concerning the topic of medical care during the Civil War, historian Victoria Holder wrote that at the beginning of the war, neither the Union nor the Confederacy had any plan for hospitals because they did not believe fighting would last more than a couple months. By 1862, the Union and Confederacy had passed laws creating hospital systems, but by that time, field hospitals were the most relied upon source of treatment for wounded soldiers. Field hospitals were often located a mile or two away from the battlefield. They frequently lacked ample room and supplies to treat the men in their care.","Historian James McPherson, when he wrote about medicine in the Civil War, stated that field hospitals were often churches, hotels, warehouses, shops, barns, private homes, etc. In terms of staff, they were often composed of white women who volunteered to help out. From these sources alone, it is not farfetched to believe what Whitman described in his poem was the truth."],"display_date":"December 1867 - January 1892","search_date":"1879-12-31","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1839,"tag":"Walt Whitman"},{"id":1838,"tag":"Field Hospital"},{"id":1837,"tag":"Poem"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5802,"title":"<strong>A Virginia Soldier Reflects on Battle and Wishes to be Home for the Holidays</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-11-30","end_date":"1862-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Sunday morning, November 30, 1862, Confederate soldier John French White wrote an intimate, yet dismal letter to his wife, Mat. White’s letter began with an explanation of how grateful he was to have received mail from his wife: “[I] contented myself by reading your welcome letter which afforded me great pleasure.” A few lines later, Mr. White proceeded to explain the horrors of the Battle of Sharpsburg (Antietam), which he had been involved in a few months earlier.","In his description of the Battle of Sharpsburg, White wrote, “Oh Mat it","almost makes [me] shudder to think of it how…Sept. 17 ’62 [will] live in the memory of the 32 Va. reg[iment] & its friends.” Despite all the carnage and devastation of the battle, White walked away unharmed. He viewed his survival as an act of God: “Thanks be to a kind Providence I came out unhurt but narrowly escaped. A ball passed [only] through my blanket between my body and right arm.”","The heart of White’s letter, however, is found in the remarks he made about coming home for Christmas. White acknowledged his wife’s plea for him to “get a pass to come to Mothers in the Chris[t]mas.” In response to her plea, Mr. White wrote, “I am sorry to tell you to do either [find a substitute or go home] is utterly impos[s]ible.” Although he hinted at the fact that he wanted to be home for Christmas, White understood that he had a commitment to the Confederacy. Since Mr. White was on “picket duty” in Fredericksburg and was expecting the city to be shelled by the Union forces, he had to abruptly end his letter.","White’s fear of the memory of the Battle of Sharpsburg had a lot of merit. As historian James McPherson pointed out, Sharpsburg was the site of some of the Civil War’s hardest fighting. Just as White had hinted, at nighttime on September 17, 1862, Confederate military leaders reported losses greater than fifty percent in several brigades. In addition, President of the Maryland Historical Society, Burton Kummerow, noted that about 23,000 soldiers were killed and wounded during the Battle of Sharpsburg. In regard to White’s fear of how the day would be remembered, Kummerow argued that it would forever be seen as a victory for the Union, and it eventually prompted Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation. Historian Stephen Sears also argued that the perceived Union victory at Sharpsburg compounded with the Emancipation Proclamation, prevented Britain, France, and other foreign agents from getting involved in the Civil War.","Aside from the Battle of Sharpsburg, White’s letter reflected emotions shared by soldiers on both sides during the Civil War. The Civil War proved to be more than just a few short battles. The physical and emotional stresses brought about by fighting, such as that at Shapsburg, gave every man a strong desire and longing for home, especially around the holidays."],"display_date":"November 30, 1862","search_date":"1862-11-30","locations":[{"id":5992,"lat":39.4722539212,"lng":-77.3980976361,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":122,"tag":"Soldier"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1256,"tag":"Christmas"},{"id":1793,"tag":"Virginia Infantry"},{"id":1853,"tag":"Fredericksburg"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5804,"title":"Pennsylvania Surgeon Tends to the Wounded at South Mountain","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-09-14","end_date":"1862-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Theodore S.

On the fourteenth of that month, General McClellan tasked Christ’s regiment with taking Turner’s Gap during the Battle of South Mountain. Their goal was to silence a Confederate artillery battery firing from the Gap. The soldiers fought uphill against Confederates defenders behind stone fences. However, despite the regiment being only one month old, Dr. Christ wrote in his diary “our noble 45<sup>th</sup> fought with the bravery and skill of veteran soldiers” and forced the Confederates to retreat “where they had thousands against our hundreds.” The doctor tended to the wounded carried to him while the battle raged around him. In his diary he wrote, “One place that I had just been a few moments before a shell struck and exploded, throwing the dirt all over me 50 yards off.” This instance and similar others prompted Christ to move his hospital 300 yards down the hill before continuing with his work.","According to the regimental history of the 45<sup>th</sup> Infantry, twenty-seven soldiers were killed and 107 wounded during the two and a half hours of combat. The intense fighting claimed General Jesse Reno, the commander of the Ninth Corps. Reno became the target of a Confederate sharpshooter while he surveyed the enemy and was shot in the chest.

A Union corporal found a copy of the order wrapped around three cigars next to a road in Frederick, Maryland. General McClellan used this information in an attempt to attack the separate Confederate forces. To get to the enemy, he had to send his troops over South Mountain, where Lee and his Rebels were waiting in the passes through the range.

By the end of the second day of fighting, the corps under Slocum had been pushed back to Culp’s Hull at the northern end of the Union line. On the dawn of the third day, Lytle watched as soldiers of the unit pushed outward in an attempt to recapture the positions they had held the day before. In his diary, he wrote his comrades were “hotly engaged…but half a mile off. This infantry fighting commenced at 4 am.” The fight between Slocum’s men and the Confederate troops under General Edward Johnson lasted for seven hours. In this time, the Union men managed to drive off the Rebels and reclaim their trenches from the previous day. Following this action, the battle subsided for a few hours.","Private Lytle, feeling safe due to the lull in the fighting, settled down to take a nap in the woods of Culp’s Hill. He awoke fifteen minutes after one o’clock to the sound of Confederate cannons firing on the Union positions on Cemetery Hill. Lytle described the barrage as such: “The cannonading for two hours was terrific, exceeding Chancellorsville in rapidity. The shells did fearful execution.” This cannon fire was the opening act of what would become known as Pickett’s Charge. During this attack, as many as 15,000 Confederate troops charged across almost a mile of open field, straight into Union artillery and rifle fire. Over half of the attackers were cut down before the retreat was sounded. This marked the turning point of the battle and the furthest Confederate troops advanced through Union lines. After the failed charge, Lytle climbed the hill to look into Gettysburg, but returned to his position after a narrow miss with a sharpshooter’s bullet. The next day, Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia withdrew and escaped to Maryland. Over the course of the three days, over 50,000 Union and Confederate soldiers died on the fields of Gettysburg.

With fallen soldiers decorating the landscape of the Gettysburg battlefield, <em>The Republican Compiler</em>, a Gettysburg newspaper from 1854 to 1868, published vivid details of what the battlefield looked like and the significant effects the battle left on the town.","A local man, Mr. Cooke, who was a special correspondent for <em>The Age</em>, another local newspaper, gave one of the most graphic accounts of the battle’s aftermath. <em>The Republican Compiler</em> printed Cooke’s account in their July 20, tenth edition; the second paper that they had printed since the end of the battle. Cooke gave a report of the entire battle, but the section where he describes the scenery after the battle is the most moving.","He visited the battlefield on Tuesday July 7; four days after the battle had ended. He described the abandoned battlefield in a manner that is similar to it being completely destroyed. He stated that, “Every fence was knocked down, and every house or shed upon the battle field around it had its windows shattered, its walls torn out and its roof in tatters… The grain and grass which once grew there, was almost ground to a jelly.” The Union forces had about 94,000 men serving at the battle and the Confederates had 70,000 men. The number of men who marched, shot, and were killed or wounded at Gettysburg led to the destruction of the terrain.","Cooke not only described the battle and the destruction that occurred in Gettysburg, he also explained the common horrors of the Civil War. Cooke wrote about the dead soldiers that he saw on the battlefield and states that, “Many walked about amid the horrid stench of the field unmoved. The looked upon the dead, to be sure; with no expression of pity if he were a Federal soldier and only a laugh of a curse if he were a Confederate…” Cooke offered the view that all of the men should be remembered for how they fought and died, instead of who they were fighting for. And his portrait of other people looking through the battlefield for their own memento or souvenir, instead of being deeply effected by how many dead they were walking through is a prime example of how people became numb to the horrific events that surrounded them."],"display_date":"July 20, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-20","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1861,"tag":"Confederates"},{"id":321,"tag":"Union Army"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1860,"tag":"Battle of Gettysburg"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5812,"title":"A Black Union Soldier Demands Equal Pay","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-01","end_date":"1864-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a recommendation for trial written by a First Lieutenant of the 2<sup>nd</sup> U.S Colored Cavalry in early June of 1864 there is mention of Private Sylvester Ray, also of the 2<sup>nd</sup> U.S Colored Cavalry, who demanded equal pay for the African-American soldiers. In this recommendation, he states that, “he charges conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline.” At this time, black soldiers made seven dollars a month plus a three dollar clothing allowance while white soldiers of the same rank made thirteen dollars a month.","In many units, black soldiers were not permitted the same benefits as their white counterparts. It did not take long for the black soldiers to become aware of these discrepancies and start to demand equal pay. Private Sylvester Ray wanted pay that was the same as white soldiers because seven dollars a month was not enough to send home or pay for things that the black soldiers needed. Additionally, this discrepancy in pay was an injustice to African-American soldiers who were fighting for the same cause as their white counterparts.","According to historian Christian Samito, “the pay disparity undermined army discipline but also energized black soldiers’ demands for equal treatment.” When black soldiers realized that they were not being paid equally they threatened to desert the army or to rise against their white superior officers. Other places, the black soldiers rejected their pay, demanding equal pay. The tipping point for many of the soldiers was letters that had been sent from home. In many of these letters, their parents, wives, or children did not have enough money to survive on and were suffering. After receiving his letter, one unnamed soldier said, “we have been tried in the fire both of affliction and of the rebels, and nothing remains but pure metal.” This sentiment was reflected across most black units until equal pay was promised in late June, just a short while after Private Ray’s recommendation for trial. After enough troops protested the unfair conditions, the military started to listen. Samito believes that change occurred as “white officers came to realize, black soldiers mutinied not out of nervous energy…but as political action undertaken by men who felt newly entitled by their wearing of the uniform.","Private Sylvester Ray’s subsequent muster roll was also listed with his recommendation for trial. In the muster roll, it is clear that his pay for the month was raised to be equal with what was normal for white soldiers. It appears that his insistence on fairness and justice paid."," "," "," "],"display_date":"June 1864","search_date":"1864-06-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":321,"tag":"Union Army"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5813,"title":"Generals Sherman and Forrest Talk About the War","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-09-10","end_date":"1870-09-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In September of 1870 the <em>Shenandoah Herald</em> reported a conversation overheard between General William Tecumseh Sherman (U.S.) and General Nathan Bedford Forrest (formerly C.S.A) on a riverboat somewhere on the Mississippi River. The article reported that Sherman explained to Forrest the trouble he had created for him filling not only his every waking thought, but his dreams as well. Forrest replied by telling Sherman that if he had been given the command he had asked for he would have not only been a dream but a real nightmare pressing Sherman’s flanks on their “march to the sea” and forcing them to walk through the most hazardous land.","Like many of his contemporaries, William Tecumseh Sherman started his military career at the United States Military Academy. After some time in Florida during the Second Seminole War he served in California rather than in the Mexican-American War like his colleagues. Before the Civil War broke out Sherman worked briefly in law and banking before taking up the post as superintendent of the Louisiana Military Academy; a post he resigned at the outbreak of the war to rejoin the Federal Army. On the Confederate side in the war Nathan Bedford Forest started his military career as a cavalry private. Then using money he had earned as a successful cotton, land, and slave dealer created his own unit of which he was named lieutenant colonel; this unit would later become the famous 7<sup>th</sup> Tennessee Cavalry. Forrest eventually rose to the rank of brigadier general.","Both men distinguished themselves during the war playing key roles in leading their respective armies. Throughout the war Forrest used lightning strike tactics to harry and terrorize Federal Forces. In the summer of 1864 Sherman remarked, “that devil Forrest must be hunted down and killed if it costs ten thousand lives and bankrupts the federal treasury.”","This candid moment between former enemies reveals the importance that honor played in the lives officers at the end of the nineteenth-century. The South especially subscribed to a “Culture of Honor” where it was important to not offend others and to maintain you reputation.

Knapp of the 9<sup>th</sup> Indiana Regiment wrote a letter to his friend Mary Merrick during his stay in a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In this letter, Knapp commented, “Where there are many people together they are liable to catch disease. More than they do at home. I used to be afraid but I am now all over it now.” These diseases afflicted many soldiers throughout the war.","Disease was a major part of the Civil War. Historian Dale C. Smith, who studied medicine throughout the war, stated, “The general hospitals early in the conflict were makeshift arrangements in whatever buildings could be found, an approach that was seriously flawed.” The army lacked enough doctors or other medical officials to meet the demand of injured soldiers. Historian Richard H. Shryock estimates that each surgeon at Gettysburg had about nine hundred cases to tend to. This caused doctors to work quickly, increasing the odds of spreading disease amongst the injured.","The methods that surgeons used were often unsanitary. For example, chest or abdominal wounds required the surgeons to probe the wound to find the bullets or to help stop the bleeding. The hospitals themselves also carried many germs. Poor sanitary conditions allowed diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, and diarrhea to infect soldiers.","Knapp’s fear of disease shows how rampant it was among soldiers in close quarters. Shyrock mentions that “High as were the casualties, it is well known that losses from disease were higher.” He also mentions that roughly ten percent of all soldiers were sick at one time. Fear of disease such as Knapp expressed, coupled with the mortality rates of those that caught disease, wore on soldiers as the war went on.","In a study cited by Smith, there were approximately 6,445,000 casualties combined between the Union and Confederate armies from May 1, 1861 through June 30, 1866. Of these, over six million were disease related. Shryock also looked at the numbers of deaths during the Civil War. According to him, by the end of the war, about 250,000 Union troops were killed by disease compared to 110,000 deaths from battle injuries. That means that roughly 70% of deaths in the Union army were a result of disease. Similarly, Confederate soldiers suffered about 164,000 deaths from disease and 94,000 on the battlefield; good for roughly a 64% disease mortality rate.","As the war continued, there were some improvements made in medicine that helped. Quinine and chloroform were both agents used during surgeries to help ease pain and make surgeons’ jobs easier. These advances also helped to ease the minds of soldiers such as Knapp."],"display_date":"April 8, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-08","locations":[{"id":12053,"lat":35.1803733014,"lng":-85.1633326083,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5816,"title":"African-American Killed KKK Member in Memphis, Tennessee","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-03-19","end_date":"1868-03-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 19, 1868, <em>The New York Times </em>reported the murder of a supposed Ku-Klux Klan member by a “Negro” in Memphis, Tennessee. The paragraph summary reported that a group of Klan members went to the African-American’s home the night prior and “demanded admission” there. Henry C. Blair, the supposed KKK member, shot and killed by the homeowner during the confrontation. <em>The New York Times</em> predicted there would be no “further trouble” despite the animosity the situation had created in the surrounding area.","The general philosophy around the creation of the Ku Klux Klan “tapped the daily economic and social frustrations of the average white southerner, and in doing so rationalized who the enemy was and how they were to be defined, fought, and eliminated as a threat,” claimed professor Kwando Miassi Kinshasa. The KKK began as armed counterpoint to the reconstruction ideas implemented in the United States after the Civil War. Many KKK members were “war-veterans, the unemployed, the ex-slave, poor white farmers and restless youth whose fortunes were yet to be made and lost.” As the United States prepared to make massive changes in a country that remained in shambles from a four year war, the entry of thousands of African-Americans into the status of citizens was a nightmare for southerners who lost the war. Kinshasa wrote, “Violent attacks by the Ku Klux generally inflicted havoc among unarmed rural Freedmen.” The notion of slavery died with the Civil War, but, the idea that African-Americans could have full ownership of property and their own labor was an idea that many Southerners could not reconcile after the defeat of the war. To disarm the Freedmen from all power and rights would place the whites back in a position of power and leadership after a dreadful defeat.","The murder of a Klansmen in Tennessee represented the willingness of African-American citizens to fight for the rights that were inherently theirs.

The Union lost the fort for the remainder of the war during the first battle of the American Civil War, but the newspaper was more concerned with the fact that the North was going to be under control of the Republican Party because the war had officially started.","During the battle, not a single life on either side was lost to hostile fire, but in the eyes of the northern Democrats the real loss was the representation of Democrats in Congress, according to the newspaper. The political unrest, such as outlined in the Democratic-leaning <em>Watchman</em>, occurred as a result of the war starting to spread throughout the country.

The flag of the United States, a symbol of freedom and democracy in the Union was taken down after the battle and replaced with the Confederate national flag. In the article, the tone changed when the flag was discussed. Historian Mark E. Neely commented about the flag at the fort, “the first prints of Sumter were quickly supplanted by those depicting the American flag under attack. These constituted the earliest manifestations of the Union image…” As Neely points out, the tone of the Watchman piece was hardly unique in expressing fervor for the Union despite opposing Republican leadership in general. As the <em>Watchman </em>article stated, “We can have no government on any other terms, but it has often been found in the world’s history that a bad government is better than none at all.” The statement exemplifies that the Democratic northern citizens know that they need the government to win the War Between the States and without it there would be not be a chance.","The article portrays a negative connotation towards all government bodies, but the rally-around-the-flag cry had a larger impact because the people know that they need the government to win the war."],"display_date":"April 18, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-18","locations":[{"id":10917,"lat":40.9190359343,"lng":-77.8196278227,"zoom":9,"place":"CENTRE, Pennsylvania"},{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1873,"tag":"Republicans"},{"id":1876,"tag":"Fort Sumter"},{"id":1877,"tag":"Flag"},{"id":1878,"tag":"Democrats"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6067,"title":"Southern, Sassy, and Strong","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-06-05","end_date":"1865-04-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Midnight train rides, cleaning wounds and changing dressing was not the job for a proper Southern woman.

The fighting in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, started in the early morning of July 1, 1863, and lasted three days, until July 3. Despite the Union’s decisive victory at Gettysburg, around 23,000 of their soldiers died during the three day battle, whereas the Confederate Army lost 28,000 [1]. Photographs were taken of the battlefield and serve as a reminder of both how many lives this famous battle claimed, and the humanity of the fallen soldiers. One photograph in particular, Timothy O’Sullivan’s <em>A Harvest of Death</em>, gives a dramatic, yet realistic portrayal of Gettysburg’s casualties and the horrors of war.","The famous nineteenth century photographer, Matthew Brady, is most often associated with Civil War photography. He was in charge of a substantial crew of photographers, and often attributed their photographs to himself, as well as those of other photographers to which he had no business relations [2]. Brady was the former employer of other accomplished photographers, such as Alexander Gardner. Gardner and his cameramen, James Gibson and Timothy O’Sullivan, were accomplished photographers in their own right. After leaving Brady’s employment, Gardner and his crew focused on the grisly, uncensored realities of war, taking photos of the dead men and horses strewn about the battlefields. These photographers traveled to battlefield locations in covered wagons, which served as both a mobile storage facility and a darkroom [3]. Gardner led a three-man team which arrived at Gettysburg late in the morning of July 5, 1863, soon after the defeated Confederate General Robert E. Lee left the battlefield. The photographers immediately began taking photographs of their bloody surroundings, and Timothy O’Sullivan, one of Alexander Gardner’s photographers, snapped his famous photograph [4].","The photo shows the bodies of dead soldiers scattered across a field, among the debris from battle, and in the distance, two living men with horses can be seen. Prominent among the dead, the decaying corpse of a Union soldier is seen with his legs splayed, right arm outstretched, head turned towards the photographer, and his mouth forced open due to bloating. The other men lie in similar positions, but their heads are turned away. The soldiers’ once-handsome uniforms are disheveled; several of their coats are unbuttoned, and some are missing shoes. The dead lie at varying distances from O’Sullivan’s camera; the scattering of bodies continues until they fade into the mist [5]. Because the battle ended two days prior to the taking of this photograph, the bodies are not those of freshly deceased men, although they remain unburied in the July heat. The photo was fittingly titled <em>A Harvest of Death</em>.","The photographs of the Civil War hold a great amount of significance, to both contemporary and modern audiences. O’Sullivan’s photograph immortalized the carnage of the Battle of Gettysburg, giving non-combatants and future generations a view of the battlefield, in all its gruesome authenticity. This photograph gives humanity to the unnamed fallen soldiers and, together with the many other photos published from various Civil War battlefields, brought the horrors of war to the attention of the American public. These photographs were a stark contrast to the portraiture of powerful figures that Americans were used to seeing – high-ranking officers and government officials posing for the camera. Aside from their families and friends, most of the dead men on the battlefield were unknown to the general public [6]. The idealized glamour of war – the stylish uniforms, well-groomed horses, and the heroic nature of the soldiers who would fight for their families, their country, and their values – all of this was pushed aside in the photographs to show the true, gruesome nature of the battlefield.","Due to public demand, these photographs were displayed in galleries for public viewing and printed in newspapers using a woodcut of the glass images [7]. The American public was simultaneously horrified and fascinated by the morbid scenes depicted in the photographs. The <em>New York</em> <em>Times,</em> speaking of the photographs (for which Brady was given undue credit), said that they had “done something to bring home to us the terrible reality and earnestness of war.

Gatling, is the precursor to all modern machine guns. However, like all inventions, its legitimacy had to be proven. The document <em>Advertisement for Gatling Gun and Battery</em> is an example of the need to promote the benefits of the Gatling Gun to the public [1]. It is not known where it was first published; however, due to the fact that it is a single document and not connected to others, it is likely that it was published independent of any other works.","This document's original author is currently unknown, but the praise that the author bestows upon the Gatling Gun, such as citing claims made by United States Army and Navy officers that two of the guns with a group of twenty men could do more damage in combat than an entire regiment, shows that it was likely written by someone who was interested in promoting sales of the Gatlin Gun . Though the exact date of publication cannot be found for this artifact, the inclusion of a testimony by the Master Mechanic in the Navy Yard dated July 18, 1863, suggests that the flier was likely printed and distributed sometime in late summer or early fall of 1863 . This supposition is supported by fact that the weaon's manufacturer needed to quickly distribute information about the weapon due to the raging American Civil War in order to promote its sale and use by the Union Army.","The audience of this advertisement was likely two-fold, both of whom comprise different parts of the Union which can be surmised by the quotes provided by Union military officials. The inclusion of differing font sizes to draw attention to the names being promoted as supporters of the Gatling Gun, as well as a clear attempt to provoke an emotional response by suggesting that far fewer individuals will need to be hospitalized if the weapon is used, suggests that this was designed for the public and not as an official document for major military or political leaders. However, by provoking public support for the Gatling Gun, the author is obviously trying to reach out to those individuals in a position to commission the purchase and use of the Gatling Gun, therefore the audience of the advertisement is directly the public and indirectly the leaders of the Union.","The purpose for which this advertisement was created was to bring to light the tactical advantages provided by the Gatling Gun. Throughout the article facts and statistics are provided to persuade the reader that the new gun will shoot faster, more accurately, and required less maintenance than other weapons. It also claims that it can lessen the number of individuals that need to be put in harm’s way thanks to its heightened killing ability. This document was designed to promote the weapons ability to ensure victory for the Union if it is used and persuade the government, as well as citizens, that it is a tool that needed to be on the battlefield to help ensure victory.","While the advertisement discusses the merits of R.J. Gatling’s new gun, it was clearly influenced heavily by the American Civil War. It highlighted several attributes that, while always favorable attributes in a weapon, would have been even more appealing due to the progress of the war during the late summer or early fall of 1862. At the time of the advertisement, General Robert E. Lee had pushed into Union territory after a bloody victory at the second battle of Bull Run [2]. The Union did manage to throw the Confederate Army out of their territory, but it was again at the cost of an enormous number of lives at the battle of Antietam which was followed up by the dismissal of the union’s top ranked General McCllelan [3]. The extreme loss of life in such a short time frame as well as the dysfunctional state of the union Army would have left the Union in need of something to hold onto as a source of hope for a victory and end to the war.","In addition, the Gatling Gun had been well received in military circles all over the world, with the exception of the Union Army. This was due to General Ripley’s, who was a General and top advisor to President Lincoln, enthusiastic refusal to accept the weapon. The reason for this refusal is not fully known but likely had to do, in part, with Gatling’s southern origins which could have painted him as an untrustworthy individual [4]. As previously noted, the advertisement uses testimony from several military officials. It is reasonable to view this inclusion as a direct response to Ripley’s negative view of the weapon and as an attempt to counter his arguments against it."," ","[1] Author Unknown, <em>Advertisemant for Gatling Gun and </em>Battery, Accessed on July 27<sup>th</sup> from http://cdm15078.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/Milroy/id/587/rec/4","[2] “President Lincoln Removes General McCllelan”, <em>History, </em>accessed July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2014 from http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lincoln-removes-mcclellan","[3] <em>Ibid</em>.","[4] Albert E.

Milroy in counterinsurgency fighting against Confederate guerrillas in Western Virginia early on in the war.  Napoleonic-style warfare practiced during the Civil War proved futile against the guerrilla warfare with the Confederates along the border region.  However, General Milroy developed guerrilla tactics of his own that proved highly successful against the rebels throughout Western Virginia.  The Confederates became so frustrated with losing at their own game of guerrilla warfare that they placed a bounty on General Milroy.","Unfortunately, he and his men did not arrive in southern Pennsylvania in time to stop the Rebel destruction due to an earlier encounter with Rebel troops in Winchester, Virginia that resulted in the scattering of part of his forces. Union leadership had focused most of its forces elsewhere, leaving southern Pennsylvania vulnerable to attack from Confederate raiders.  Many of Pennsylvania’s militia had also left for home due to being “dissatisfied with the six months’ term of service”, therefore adding to the region’s vulnerability.","Newspapers and telegrams reported that the small town of McConnellsburg, located in Fulton County, suffered the brunt of the damage. New York’s 8th and 71st regiments, along with a squadron of cavalry, moved towards Greencastle, in hopes of preventing the rebels from future raids on southern Pennsylvania towns.  Mercersburg and McConnellsburg, two prominent towns in Fulton County, had neither Union troops nor local militia available to stop the raiders.  In fact, the two hundred Confederates burned the McConnellsburg courthouse and jail on June 19.  One of the citizens followed them as they made their way back to the Confederate strongholds in the Maryland cities of Hagerstown and Williamsport.  He described the raiders leaving McConnellsburg with “a large drove of cattle and horses.”","Escaped slaves hoping to find refuge in the North also fell into the hands of the raiders.  The Confederate forces had established picket lines along the railways used by slaves making their way north.  One correspondent described the ordeal stating that “the rebels seize all they can find” of the unfortunate fugitive slaves.","By the close of June 19, Confederate raiders had successfully completed their tasks and returned to Maryland having only suffered the loss of two captured men."],"display_date":"June 19, 1863","search_date":"1863-06-19","locations":[{"id":11038,"lat":39.9254362791,"lng":-78.1124346626,"zoom":9,"place":"FULTON, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":2476,"tag":"McConnellsburg"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6241,"title":"Seven Days Battle Letter Gives Insight into Soldier’s Lives","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-07-03","end_date":"1862-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter from R. Emmett Martin to his wife, one can see the content, yet suffering state of mind that most Confederate soldiers were in during the days following the Seven Days Battle. Soldiers wanted to be cheerful as they had just won a battle, but were seemingly unable to muster that emotion because of the losses they endured. The Seven Days Battle was technically a Confederate victory. However, historians wonder if it should be considered a victory at all, as the South suffered immense losses.  Martin demonstrated how distressed many southern soldiers were from the deaths and wounds of comrades and the prolonged time and distance between themselves and their loved ones. Other than the effects of the Seven Days Battle on the Confederacy, it also becomes obvious in this letter how poorly educated some of the soldiers were who were fighting in the Civil War.","James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom,</em> has discussed how devastating the Seven Days Battle was to the southern troops. McPherson reports that the Confederate’s “total causalities in these six contests exceeded Union casualties by 20,000 men.” R. Emmett Martin emphasized this reality as he named off several soldiers he knew who fell that day. Martin summarized that “Our regiment lost in killed and wounded one hundred and twenty six [men].” It is questionable how southerners were supposed to consider this battle a victory when they had lost so much.","The importance of family is also emphasized in Martin’s letter. These soldiers had lives and families waiting for them to return home. Martin showed how important his family was to him as he began his letter: “I write in a haste and only a few lines to inform you of my safety after the hard fought Battle…” Martin spent his spare moments on writing letters to reassure his family that he was still alive. At the end of the letter, he also promises to write again, and in more detail, when he had more time.","Lastly, R. Emmett Martin’s letter shows a stereotypical southern Civil War soldier. It seems as though Martin could not have gone more than a few lines in his letter without a spelling error. For example, “I was in with the regimant,” and “it was an awfull hot place.” These spelling errors also could have been due to other factors such as hurrying to write. However, Frank E. Smitha, a lifelong researcher of history and philosophy, explains that southerners overall were in fact poorly educated during this time compared to their northern counterparts. He states that “Of the nation's 321 public high schools only 30 were in the South.”","Overall, the letter from R. Emmett Martin reiterated many ideas from McPherson, and brought plenty of new ideas to the table as well."],"display_date":"July 3, 1862","search_date":"1862-07-03","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"},{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":2229,"tag":"Soldier's letter"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6301,"title":"Jennie Wade Only Civilian Killed During the Battle of Gettysburg","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-03","end_date":"1863-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["An estimated 50,000 soldiers died during the three-day Battle of Gettysburg that lasted from July 1 to July 3, 1863.  Of all the many causalities inflicted, only one civilian died during the battle. On July 3, 1863 Virginia Mary “Jennie” Wade was baking bread in her sister Georgia McClellan’s home on Baltimore Street. Tillie Pierce, a resident of Gettysburg, recalled hearing from a captain in the Union army that “Jennie Wade had been killed while baking bread for her sick sister.”","When the first shots were fired on July 1, 1863 outside of Gettysburg, Jennie, her mother, and youngest brother Isaac went to McClellan’s home thinking they would be safer there and also to aid McClellan with her newborn son.  Later that afternoon Union troops moved to hills on that side of town and the McClellan house fell in direct line of fire.  After that day’s fighting, Wade went outside to help care for wounded Union soldiers.","On July 2, the McClellan home remained surrounded by gunfire shattering several windows and an artillery shell came in through the roof lodging in the eaves.  A bullet also entered the house and hit the bedpost of the bed where McClellan lay with her son.  On the morning of July 3, Wade decided to make biscuits.  According to historian Noah Trudeau, while Wade finished kneading the dough around eight in the morning, “a stray sharpshooter’s bullet penetrated the door on the northern side of the house and passes through a small inner room…The miniè ball hit her in the back and blew out through her breast, piercing her heart on its way.”","McClellan found Wade and screamed loud enough that Union soldiers passing by heard and escorted the rest of the family through a hole created by an exploding artillery shell by the cellar.  On July 4 as Confederate soldiers retreated from Gettysburg, Jennie Wade was wrapped in a blanket and buried in McClellan’s backyard. It wasn’t until January 1864 that her body was moved to a German Reformed Church cemetery in the next town.  Wade’s body was moved to its permanent location in November 1865 in Evergreen Cemetery and a monument was constructed in 1900.  Buried beside Wade is Johnston “Jack” Skelly who historians believe might have been engaged to Wade.

Thomas to defend Nashville from a final Confederate attack.  Before they had a chance to engage the enemy, a severe ice storm hit the area on December 8.  Thomas used this delay to ponder the strategy even more, much to the chagrin of General Ulysses Grant and President Lincoln in Washington.  The 8<sup>th</sup>, like many other regiments that came from all over the Midwest to reinforce the Union, were itching to fight.","Thomas had close to 55,000 men for the battle, and the 8<sup>th</sup> took up positions on the Federal fortified line west of the city.  The Union had two fortified lines, one closer to downtown, near their headquarters in the Belmont Mansion, and one out towards Belle Meade further west.  General John Bell Hood, of the Confederates, positioned his 30,000 men directly south of the city, in present day Forest Hills, Tennessee, forming a solid line from east to west.  He had just pushed north from the south after a failed attack on Union forces at Franklin, Tennessee.  He now looked to salvage that blunder by attacking at Union strength, even though he was vastly outnumbered.  The stage was now set for battle.","The weather finally cleared on December 15.  Thomas sent a diversionary attack to Hood’s right flank with the United States Colored troops (one of the first African American battalions) while planning his main thrust, which was an attack from the left to engulf Hood’s exposed left flank.  The diversionary attack did not achieve its purpose because Hood decided to strengthen the left flank anyway.  The 8<sup>th</sup> sprang into action as one of the brigades leading the charge under Lieutenant Colonel Britton.  With battle-tested precision, the 8<sup>th</sup> made “four distinct charges” at Hood’s left flank[1], and destroying their garrison and pressing up the 1,000 foot hill the Confederates had fortified.  This hill, later to be called Shy’s Hill because of the Confederate general William Shy, who was killed on it, was where the 8<sup>th</sup> made its final charge and drove the Confederate defenses off the hill and they fled south.  The 8<sup>th</sup> lost 10 men and had 52 wounded, but ended up capturing a “6-gun battery, 400 prisoners, and 2 stands of colors”[2]. Companies B&D of the regiment also captured 200 prisoners as well as covering up the rear flank.","The Battle of Nashville had been won, but the war was not over nor was the mission of the 8<sup>th</sup>.  They continued to chase Hood south through Tennessee and eventually northern Alabama.  They made their way all the way down to the bayou in New Orleans, and eventually east in Mobile, Alabama.  They returned back to Madison, Wisconsin on September 13, 1865 where they were disbanded.  They had traveled over 4,200 miles and served the great state of Wisconsin proud.  They returned with 964 men out of the original 973[3], and proudly displayed “Old Abe”, the fighting bald eagle, at the Milwaukee Fair in 1865.","Bibliography","Quiner, E.B. 1866. <em>Military History of Wisconsin.</em> Chicago: Clarke & Company."," "," ","[1] Quiner, 537","[2] Quiner, 538","[3] Quiner, 539"],"display_date":"December 15, 1864 - December 16, 1864","search_date":"1864-12-15","locations":[{"id":11954,"lat":36.1725147903,"lng":-86.7796759805,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":2206,"tag":"Wisconsin"},{"id":182,"tag":"Nashville"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":141,"school_id":68}},{"id":6404,"title":"Coming South: A Confederate Sympathizer in a Northern State","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-14","end_date":"1860-12-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Just days before South Carolina seceded from the United States in December of 1860, an article titled “Coming South” was printed in a South Carolina newspaper, the <em>Abbeville Press.</em> The article included a letter written by a Northern Gentleman who wanted to support Southerner’s interests in rebelling against the abolitionist North. He believed that the South had been tolerant of the North’s tyranny for too long, and that the Southern states should rebel against the Union. The letter was originally addressed to a large commercial house in Mobile, Alabama, and it discussed the mounting political tensions at the time of publication between the Northern abolitionist states and the Southern pro-slavery states. The author of the letter stated that he was always a believer in the “divine and legal right of slavery,” and in state’s right of secession, and his beliefs made him an outlier in the North. Because secession seemed likely, the author wanted to express his support for the state’s right to secede, and for his desire to conduct business with or even migrate to the South in the event of secession. The author had accumulated land and wealth, and also produced goods that were exclusive to northern states, which would be valuable to the cotton states. The author claimed that if the Southern Confederacy was created as its own union, his first priority would have been to defend that right to secede, and his second would have been to help establish trade between the Confederacy and Europe, both of which would have been essential to fostering the Confederacy’s independence. The author chose to side with the South, because he believed fundamentally in the right to own slaves, to trade freely, and to secede if these rights were infringed upon.","In the letter presented in “Coming South,” the author addressed the issue of secession in terms of it being the only means to protect the interests of the South. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War,</em> historian Bruce Levine discussed how Southerners believed that their position in the United States was untenable, and how the fear of abolition lead to secession (226). The letter author reflected the dominant ideology of the South at the time, because Southerners felt that in order to protect their economic interests and their existing lifestyle, it was necessary to remove themselves from a union that sought to eradicate slavery. Levine notes that antislavery sentiment had “demonstrably taken hold of a huge portion of the northern population” and that this instilled fear in the South, but the Northern letter author interestingly contrasted the dominant view of his region (233). The letter author's position as a wealthy gentelmen suggests that his interest in engaging with the South stemmed from economic concerns. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free, </em>Levine described instances of Northerners who sought to reconcile with Southern planters for the sake of economic gain, and stated that those who sided with the South were usually “key sections of the economic elite who feared alienating the slave owners more than they disliked slavery” (229). Essentially, in some instances businessmen, like the letter author, were more concerned with profiting from the Southern agricultural giants than they were with the moral aims of abolition. In \"Coming South,\" the <em>A</em><em>bbeville Press </em>used the letter to<em> </em>further the newspaper’s own pro-slavery and pro-secession agenda, by highlighting the possibility of economic and moral supprot from wealthy men in the North. The article did not give a name, location, or any identifying information about the letter’s author, so the letter could even have been a fabricated piece of propaganda, intended to encourage readers to side with secession. Southerner’s feared oppression from the majority of the North, but the existence of a pro-secession minority in the North would give Southerner’s reason to believe that they would be supported and successful if they removed themselves from the Union. Overall, the letter transcribed in “Coming South” is significant to period leading up to secession and the Civil War, because it reflected the contrast between Northern and Southern interests, and foreshadowed the eventual secession of the Southern slave states.  "," "," "],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":52809,"lat":30.6953657,"lng":-88.0398912,"zoom":8,"place":"Mobile Alabama"},{"id":52808,"lat":34.1781719,"lng":-82.3790147,"zoom":8,"place":"Abbeville South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":500,"tag":"trade"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6409,"title":"The Daily Nashville Patriot - Leading to the Civil War","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-07","end_date":"1860-12-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Daily Nashville Patriot from December 7, 1860 displays a collection of news blurbs form New York, Washington, Virginia and South Carolina. The first of which, from New York, discusses, among other things, the platform of the secessionists and their plan to take Fort Moultrie once secession has successfully taken off. From Washington there was discussion of governmental action being necessary to prevent war, as states like Texas were beginning to seem like traitors. A committee was appointed to discuss the questions leading to the “perilous condition of the country.” From Virginia it was suggested to enact a law making it illegal to rescue a slave arrested under the Fugitive Slave law and assign repercussions for not cooperating with said law. Also, from South Carolina, the house passed a bill unanimously that mobilizes a 10,000 volunteer unit armed force to be used by the government. All these blurbs combined into the same picture detail some of the underlying reasons the U.S. was headed into war with itself.","The news provided in the <em>Daily Nashville Patriot</em> alluded to the issues that America faced on every societal level; politics, economics, military, etc. The growing country faced many challenges with a population divided on many fundamental ideals, largely being slavery. In debates, Lincoln stated, “A house divided against itself cannot stand,” continuing with, “I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free,” as is cited in McPherson’s <em>Battle Cry of Freedom.</em> Abraham Lincoln argued for the abolition of slavery, bringing light to the humanitarian perspective of its irrefutable brutality, whereas the Confederate states of the South utilized slavery as a means to stimulate the growth of their nation. Slavery was an economic tool, emplaced in a society of primarily agriculture, to eliminate the necessity for waged workers. As is known about slavery, it was a violent culture, raising questions for the Northern Union states about the humanity of such a practice. A landowner’s right to own slaves truly stimulated the southern economy, and the North and South stood divided in the case where slaves were escaping to the free states, and the South was arguing for the return of their property. If the Union was to work toward abolishing slavery, the Southern economy would suffer drastically, therefore the South did what it had to in order to preserve its ideals. On a political platform, The Union worked toward abolition, whereas the Confederacy aimed to outlaw the assistance of escaped slaves. Slaves were property of the Southern plantation owners and therefore must be returned; given the ideals of the Union, this was predisposed for conflict. McPherson’s <em>Battle Cry of Freedom </em>sheds light on the issues leading to the secession of the Southern states. As Lincoln discussed about a house divided not being able to stand, the house indeed did not stand. The South seceded despite the threats of the Union disputing the Unconstitutional act that defined secession, leading to the Civil War, pitting a nation against itself. As was discussed in the brief blurbs within the <em>Daily Nashville Patriot</em>, conflict was apparent in every facet of American society during this time, with slavery the underlying driving force, posing as the political, economical and social differences that drew a line between the North and South."],"display_date":"December 7, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-07","locations":[{"id":52812,"lat":36.1626638,"lng":-86.7816016,"zoom":7,"place":"Nashville, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":2780,"tag":"Causes for the Civil War"},{"id":2779,"tag":"Daily Nashville Patriot"},{"id":2778,"tag":"Pre-Civil War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6430,"title":"Southern Feeling after the War","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-06-20","end_date":"1872-06-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although the Civil War had ended, Southerners had a hard time adjusting to the new Union and the end of slavery. Because the South had fought and succeeding from the Union to keep their way of life intact, their losing of the war was met with pain and anguish from their side. Although most of the South had this feeling of what to do next after their slaves had left, my primary document the Herald and Tribune from Jonesborough, Tennessee wrote a article in 1872 talking about how southern men who fought for the South could not get all their benefits from the pension and that this was deserved. It is surprising to hear a Southern newspaper say six years after the Civil War ended that southern men do not deserve all loyalties and benefits that union soldiers get because they had betrayed the Union and turned their backs on the country. As the one part of the article says “to those not expected it does not in any other respect relieve those who have been disloyal from any of the legal penalties, restrictions or requirements consequent”. The sense of southern men paying for their sins was an idea that was not prominent and popular idea during the Reconstruction years.","It is surprising that a Southern newspaper would have such opposite opinions of what the South was thinking during Reconstruction. The newspaper mentions that in order for the United States to move on, the South needs to take responsibility for the war and accept the fact that southern way of living with slavery was over. Southern Democrats in Congress wanted the South to just fit back into Amercan society without any sort of reprocussions or payment from the South. A lot of southern men were still opposed to black men and women being their equals and living and working besides them.","In Leon Litiwck's <em>Been in the Storm So Long Mr</em>. Litwick tells readers how hard it was for southern families to adjust to their new way of living without slaves. There are plenty of examples he gives that show that families were having a hard time making life without their slaves helping them in the field and in the house. The sense of paternalism and how slave owners though they had a connection with their slaves made their slaves leaving for their freedom that much more difficult. There were alot of examples of white families trying to force their former slaves to stay by persuasion or force and the transition to a free society was not easy for southern land owners. Although the war and slavery had ended, racism and segregation took its place in and were the foundations of the relationship between white and black families."],"display_date":"June 20, 1872 - June 21, 1872","search_date":"1872-06-20","locations":[{"id":52835,"lat":41.5775802,"lng":-77.126128,"zoom":4,"place":"Jonesborough, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6512,"title":"Abraham Lincoln: To Pardon?

He is recognized as an innovator, communicator, and commander of the telegraph. Lincoln has been named writer of war, micromanager, and technophile. After analyzing a small collection of 10 telegrams dated from April 5, 1864 to February 15, 1865 one may question the argument for pardons granted by President Lincoln. This collection of telegrams illuminates a theme of pardons, stays, commutes, and suspensions of execution. The argument for pardons in this small collection of works was rooted in Lincoln’s use of his political authority and for political favor or gain, Lincoln’s desire to confirm or deny allegations against military personnel, and Lincoln’s belief in humanitarianism practice.","An interest of political favor or gain was the rationale behind a pardon in a telegram dated April 5, 1864. Governor Brough asked President Lincoln for the pardon of the soldiers of the 12th Ohio.(1) President Lincoln granted this request.(2) Governor Brough supported Lincoln’s Administration and war efforts. Brough was viewed as a man with strong ties to governors from the Midwest and President Lincoln valued this relationship. On furthering the argument of pardons for political favor Lincoln suspended executions of deserters on November 24, 1864.(3) This suspension of executions was seen as an act granted by Lincoln to gain political favor. Lincoln was the leader of the Republican Party, and he was a supporter of abolition. Even in times of war Lincoln attempted to unite the country by granting pardons to not only Union forces but Confederates as well.(4) On December 19, 1864, President Lincoln sent a telegram to Major General Wallace inquiring information about three Confederate troops.(5) Gaining political favor from the Union, as well as the Confederates, were of importance to Lincoln and therefore, he continued to grant pardons of interest. As the end of the Civil War was approaching, President Lincoln granted suspensions of execution in order to exercise his political authority and rights to grant clemency.(6) ","President Lincoln granted pardons on the basis of his desires to confirm or deny allegations of military personnel. On October 5, 1864, President Lincoln suspended the execution of Thomas K. Miller.(7) On January 20, 1865, President Lincoln suspended the death sentence of Thomas Samplugh.(8) This pattern of suspensions continued on February 12, 1865 when Lincoln commuted the death sentence of Lieutenant Samuel B. Davis.(9) Another instance of pardons occurred on February 15, 1865 when Lincoln suspended the execution of Luther T. Palmer and requested Palmer’s record for examination.(10) In each of these telegrams, President Lincoln granted suspensions and commutes to military personnel in order to confirm or deny allegations.","When pardons, stays, suspensions, and commutes were not being granted for political favor or further investigation, President Lincoln appeared to portray a humanitarian character. This act of humanitarianism was exhibited in four telegrams from June 28, 1864 to February 15, 1865. President Lincoln was aware of the number of lives lost during the war and therefore, he took his right to execute seriously, as not to increase the death toll. Amos Tenney was sentenced to death for desertion, yet President Lincoln suspended the execution to determine the severity of Tenney’s actions and make the executive decision as to whether or not another life lost was necessary.(11) The life of Thomas Samplugh was one of the many lives spared by President Lincoln.(12) Samplugh could have been another name on another grave, but Lincoln took his attention away from other war related matters to consider if death was the answer to Samplugh’s actions.(13) Hugh F. Riley(14) and Luther T. Palmer(15) were two more names among the many that President Lincoln chose to practice humanitarianism efforts by considering the severity of war, the role war plays on soldiers, and the value of each and every life whether that life be Union or Confederate.","The argument to pardon was not as simple as it seems and some of Lincoln’s reasons will continue to be unknown, but a thorough analysis of 10 telegrams provides insight and answers to the question at large—To Pardon? Why or why not? Lincoln chose to pardon name after name and his decision were based on various factors including Lincoln’s use of his political authority and for political favor or gain, Lincoln’s desire to confirm or deny allegations against military personnel, and Lincoln’s belief in humanitarianism practice."," ","(1) John Hay to John Brough, 5 April 1864, The Lincoln Telegram Project, The Henry E.

This telegram signified the start of the Lincolns' third summer at the Soldiers' Home, which would come to an end sometime in October and be their final summer at their family refuge, away from the chaos of life at the White House and of Civil War Washington, DC.","            In a letter Mary Todd Lincoln wrote to a friend asking her to visit the family in Washington, Mrs. Lincoln mentioned a desire for privacy and the ability of the Soldiers' Home to fulfill that need. She described the place as beautiful, one where they would be able to ride into the city every day and \"be as secluded as we please.\" In addition to the privacy, the Lincolns enjoyed receiving friends and guests. In another letter, Mrs. Lincoln wrote that it was “such a pleasure, especially, at such a charming place as this [the Soldiers' Home], to receive one's friends.” There are also accounts of President Lincoln finding relaxing moments and even transitioning seamlessly from work to rest in the comfort of the Soldiers' Home cottage. Lincoln's private secretary, John Hay, wrote in his diary: \"I went with [President Lincoln] to the Soldier's Home and he read Shakespeare to me . . . till my heavy eye-lids caught his considerate notice and he sent me to bed.\" Another account is found in Senator Orville Browning's diary: \" In the evening went out to Soldiers' Home . . . The President got home soon after we reached there. He asked me to sit down with him on the stone steps of the portico - then took from his pocket a map of Virginia . . . and gave me all the news he had from there.

Lee’s surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. But what led up to this momentous event were a series of exchanges between the two belligerents. The beginnings of this process towards peace, at least for the sake of this article, begins in 1864. The fact of the matter is by 1864 the Navy blockade of the South was proving more effective than ever. Atlanta had fallen and Sherman was advancing to the sea with little effective opposition from the Confederate Army. Lee was hold up within Petersburg under siege by Ulysses S. Grant. Richmond too felt the burden of relentless Union shelling. The Confederacy was being driven apart by disputes over military and government policy, particularly as the military situation worsened.","In 1864 the calls for peace were becoming increasingly loud from both sides. In the North former Union General George B. McClellan ran for president against Abraham Lincoln as a Democrat with a platform that advocated the speedy conclusion to the war. In the South, Confederate President Jefferson Davis stood defiant towards popular movements in all the southern states, particularly North Carolina and Georgia. The greatest voice for peace in the South was none other than that of the Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.","In the North another individual was actively working to bring about peace: Francis Preston Blair, Sr. The idea of a diplomatic mission to Richmond was first proposed longtime peace advocate Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune. Greeley proposed someone with sufficient diplomatic backing from Lincoln to go negotiate peace with North Carolina individually, given the strength of its peace movement. Blair was just the person. Blair agreed but felt instead that he should negotiate peace with the whole of the Confederacy. Blair, the seventy-three year-old former newspaper editor, had been a long-time advisor of presidents and an influential founder of the Republican Party. But beyond these important credentials he was also a close personal friend of Jefferson Davis.","Lincoln was receptive to Blair’s plan but told him to wait until Savannah, Georgia fell, and once it did Lincoln granted Blair a pass to go into the Confederacy and return. On January 12, 1865 Blair met privately with Jefferson Davis. Blair’s pitch to Davis was to conclude a cease fire and then once tempers had calmed down the two nations would undertake a common military mission to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in Mexico where they would depose the French backed Emperor Maximillian. In doing so the two nations would restore fraternal relations and provide for a lasting peace. Davis was skeptical but consented. Blair promised to return to Washington and propose the plan to Lincoln. Blair returned on January 18 and promptly met with Lincoln. Lincoln was not at all susceptive to the Mexican plan but offered instead to send Blair back with offers to meet with anyone willing to negotiate peace, so long as it meant the restoration of the Union in its entirety.","On January 20, Blair returned to Richmond. He conveyed to Davis Lincoln was not interested in the Mexican plan. He was unable to make any such agreements because the extreme men in Congress and therefore any further peace agreements would have to bypass the politicians. Blair instead suggested a meeting between Lee and Grant, to which Davis agreed, feeling confident in Lee’s abilities to negotiate a peace. But when Blair returned Lincoln denied authorization of any such meeting between the generals. Grant in turn was able to secure a meeting between the two sides, he was able to convince Lincoln to consent to meeting with Confederates at Fort Monroe. On January 28, Davis appointed three commissioners and gave them instructions to explore all options for peace short of sacrificing independence. Those three commissioners included: Robert Hunter, John Campbell, and Alexander Stephens. On January 31, Lincoln sent a telegram to Grant at the Union headquarters in City Point, Virginia. He indicates to Grant that a messenger is on the way to him and he is to act upon the message he receives. There is no word to what that message is about in the telegraph itself. It also indicates that a gentleman, or possibly gentlemen, are coming to pass through the Union lines. Another general is mentioned in the telegraph also, General Edward Ord, more on him later. It is possible to assume this the gentlemen in question are the three Confederate delegates en route to this peace conference. On January 29, a flag of truce was waved at the siege of Petersburg to announce the passage of the three commissioners.","On February 3, the Confederate delegation met with Lincoln personally. Lincoln quickly dismissed any notion of an alliance against France or invasion of Mexico. He clearly stated that the only peace he would consent to meant the restoration of the Union as it had existed before the war. The future of slavery was still in question, Lincoln played his cards close to the chest so as not to alienate the Confederates. He readily denied the breadth of the scope of the Emancipation Proclamation. Secretary of State Seward used the Thirteenth Amendment as bait, offering to the South the opportunity to deny passage of the amendment if they were to rejoin the Union. The only real accomplishment achieved at this meeting was the establishment of a more efficient prisoner exchange system and Lincoln’s promise to grant amnesty to former Confederates and $400,000,000 for Southern states if they ended armed resistance and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. Campbell and Lincoln would meet twice in March where further agreements were made to follow a peace treaty. Also in March 1865, General Edward Otho Cresap Ord, the general mentioned in Lincoln’s telegraph, was assigned command of the Army of the James. During a prisoner exchange Ord to the opportunity to speak with Confederate General James Longstreet. During their conversation they discussed the possibilities of a peace agreement. They both agreed the best plan of action would be for Grant and Lee to meet to try and reach an agreement to end hostilities. Grant was open to the possibility and passed the plan on to Lincoln. Lincoln was still committed to full surrender of Lee’s army and ensured Grant would deny any form of surrender unless it was complete surrender.","Meanwhile fighting still raged around the city of Petersburg. On April 2, a corps of Ord’s Army of the James played an influential role in the breakthrough at Petersburg which resulted in flushing out Lee to Appomattox. On April 9, Ord led a forced march to relieve Major General Philip Sheridan’s cavalry and force Lee’s surrender. Ord would be present as Lee made his final surrender to Grant.","In the popular historiography for many years the South was, and in many ways still is, portrayed as the glorious “Lost Cause.” The Confederate Army was heralded for is gallantry and bravery. It would prove detrimental to that memory to show the Confederacy agreeing to peace talks so readily. In this view the noble army of Robert E. Lee fought until the bitter end when all hope in preserving the Old South was lost and there was no other choice than to surrender. It is an American tendency to memorialize loss and glorify the war effort, and historical writings have proved that sentiment. It has only been in recent memory that this peace narrative has emerged more into the popular conscious of Civil War memory."],"display_date":"November 1, 1864 - April 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-19","locations":[{"id":52913,"lat":37.3570894,"lng":-78.8252911,"zoom":8,"place":"Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia"},{"id":52912,"lat":37.2995049,"lng":-77.299554,"zoom":8,"place":"City Pointe, Virginia"},{"id":52911,"lat":36.9190246,"lng":-76.2699215,"zoom":8,"place":"Hampton Roads, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2994,"tag":"Edward Otho Cresap Ord"},{"id":2972,"tag":"Preston Blair"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":2554,"tag":"Alexander Stephens"},{"id":2525,"tag":"Hampton Roads Conference"},{"id":2648,"tag":"peace movement"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6518,"title":"Lincoln Unimpressed with Kentucky's Impressment of African-Americans","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-13","end_date":"1864-06-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     Noone doubted the existence of unlawful impressment of African-American soliders into the Confederate Army during the Civil War. On March 26, 1863, the Confederate Congress passed the Impressment Act, which allowed it \"to impress, or seize, food, fuel, slaves, and other commodities to support armies in the field.\" A 1793 law prohibited African Americans from bearing arms in the U.S. Army, but dwindling recruitment numbers resulted in forcing many slaves to be used for manual labor in the Confederate Army. On the other side of the battle lines, the Union Army initially had trouble recruiting free black men after Lincoln's passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, but President Lincoln would never resort to allowing his men to illegally force African-Amercians, or anyone else for that matter, to join the Union Army against their will; however, even though the Union Army legally enlisted free black men in 1863, it's evident that illegal impressment into the Union Army occured. ","When President Lincoln got wind of news that Kentucky Major General George Thomas and his men were impressing African-Americans into his Union forces, he didn't hesitate to express his dissastication. On June 13, 1864, Lincoln sent a telegram to Thomas accusing his Kentucky Union forces of \"seizing negroes and carrying them off without their own consent and according to no rules whatever, except those of absolute violence.\" Lincoln probably wasn't surprised that such an act would be occuring in a border state like Kentucky. The people of Kentucky were often at odds over the issue of slavery and most Kentuckians were not opposed to the institution --even Major General George Thomas was born into a slave-owning family and wasn't particularly sympathetic to African-Americans. Slavery wouldn't be abolished in Kentucky until December 1865 and Kentucky Union forces probably resorted to impressing black soldiers when the enlistment of free black men weren't meeting their high demands. ","Regardless of the demand that Kentucky Union forces weren't meeting in their recruitment numbers, impressment would not be tolerated under Lincoln's command. Although African-American soldiers in the Union Army suffered from subpar treatment, conditions, and compensation compared to their white counterparts, President Lincoln was aware of these issues and fought to obtain equal pay for black soldiers and equal protection for black POWs who were often heavily mistreated by their Confederate captors. Consequently, it was during the same month that Lincoln scolded Major General George Thomas for impressing African-Americans that Congress granted equal pay for U.S. colored troops. As a leader that believed in projecting a good and just moral code upon his men, President Lincoln demanded in his telegram that Major General Thomas ensure \"making soldiers of negroes is done according to the rules you are acting upon, so that unneccessary provation and irritation be avoided.\" President Lincoln's direct correspondence over the matter of the impressment of black soldiers into the Union Army illustrates his compassion for African-Americans and his no tolerancy policy of impressment and unnecessary violence towards African-Americans."],"display_date":"June 13, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-13","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52914,"lat":38.2526647,"lng":-85.7584557,"zoom":5,"place":"Louisville, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":2978,"tag":"Confederate"},{"id":2977,"tag":"Soldiers"},{"id":2976,"tag":"Telegram"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":1362,"tag":"Telegraph"},{"id":1677,"tag":"Black"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":2706,"tag":"Impressment"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6519,"title":"A Snapshot of Lincoln's Acts of Clemency In the Year of 1864","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Civil War, Lincoln reviewed over 1600 cases of military justice. The largest single topic that can be found in Lincoln’s telegrams is the reviewing and answering of appeals of military court martial decisions, especially the pardoning of scheduled executions (The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln). Lincoln recognized the strategic potential of clemency during a time of war. He pardoned a considerable number of Union soldiers in a conscious effort to boost the morale of the Union’s fighting forces. Lincoln was also widely admired among Union troops because of the perception that he took a genuine interest in the their well-being. This perception was re-enforced with each pardon of a military offender (Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 1). ","This episode begins in early 1864 wherein Lincoln orders the War Department to commute the death sentence of deserters to confinement until the end of the war and to allow commanding generals to reinstate convicted deserts if it was thought that they would be of use to the service. Lincoln said,","<em>“They are the cases that you call by that long title cowardice in the face of the enemy, but I call them for short, my “leg cases.” But I put it to you, and I leave it for you, to decide for yourself: If Almighty God gives a man a cowardly pair of legs, how can he help their running away with him?\"</em>","(Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 1) ","Then on April 5th, 1864, Lincoln mitigated the sentences of groups of soldiers in a telegram in which, John Hay, on behalf of Lincoln, writes to Governor John Brough of Ohio, stating, “The President has ordered the pardoning of the soldiers of the 12th Ohio, in accordance with your request.” ","Favoring soldiers convicted of war crimes be put to hard labor, rather than they be executed, Lincoln had the sentence of Jesse Broadway commuted to three years hard labor in September of that year. According to John Hay, Lincoln states his rationale for clemency on these grounds,","<em>“I don’t believe it will make a man any better to shoot him, while if we keep him alive, we just may get some work out of him.\"</em>","As the year progressed, Lincoln continued to pardon soldiers and on November 3rd, 1864, Lincoln sent a telegram to the officer in command in Lexington Kentucky saying, “Suspend execution of Vance Mason until further order.” Earlier that day, Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin J. Spaulding had telegraphed Lincoln stating: “Vance Mason … on the charge of desertion is condemned to be shot on the sixth of this month. I pray you that you reprieve him or grant a respite until I can bring the matter before you in form. There are mitigatory circumstances about his case which I am sure will recommend him to your clemency.” Mason’s sentence was then suspended and he was given the option to return back into the army and serve out his enlistment term in the year of 1865. (Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 8) ","Lincoln would go on to offer more acts of clemency in the next, 1865.","Ruckman and Kincaid suspect Lincoln thrived on the hope that each request that he granted further educated a portion of the public as to the necessity of a clemency power in the justice system. Lincoln's extensive effort to provide numerous and explicit explanations for clemency decisions and his willingness to exercise the power upon the advice of individuals and mass public suggest that he may well deserve credit for having utilized one of the most unilateral and imperial of executive powers in the most democratic manner” (Ruckman and Kincaid 1999) Though Lincoln’s justifications for clemency are widely ranging, it can be ascertained from his words, his written word in telegrams, and through his actions, that adopting a policy of clemency in order to save the lives of Union soldiers whenever possible, was of great importance to Lincoln."],"display_date":"January 1, 1864 - November 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-02","locations":[{"id":52916,"lat":38.0405837,"lng":-84.5037164,"zoom":8,"place":"Lexington, KY"},{"id":52915,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"D.C."},{"id":52828,"lat":40.4172871,"lng":-82.907123,"zoom":8,"place":"Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":2981,"tag":"Lincoln's telegrams"},{"id":2980,"tag":"1864"},{"id":2979,"tag":"lincoln's clemency"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6520,"title":"Union army receives heavy losses at Red River, Lincoln relieves Gen.

The target of the Union campaign was Shreveport, headquarters of a large Confederate force and capital of Confederate Louisicana. Union troops were commanded by Major General Nathaniel Banks, who was also a prominent Republican figure and a former speaker for the House of Representatives. However, despite Banks' political reputation, his battlefield tactices left much to be desired. Despite commanding a force of Union troops that heavily outnumbered the Confederates, the Union suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. While the outcome of the Civil War appeared to be decided in favor of the union, this was the last decisive Confederate victory.","The failure of the Red River campaign was the last in which Banks had significant military command. Lincoln pushed to have Banks removed of his command and was eager to learn of his removal, sending a telegram on April 22, 1864 to General Mason Brayman in Louisiana that asked \"What day did General Corse part with Gen Banks?\". Shortly after being removed from his military duties, Banks was placed on leave in Washington D.C., where he proved to be an asset to Lincoln in the political arena, lobbying Congress to support the President's plans for reconstruction in Louisiana.","Even though Banks may have been over his head in terms of his military assignments, Lincoln did not hesistate to exercise his duties as Commander in Chief, and in some way, \"micromanage\" the assignments and leadership on the battlefields. The previous telegram illustrates how important this issue was to Lincoln, as he was eager in following up his interest in removing Banks from his command. The telegraph granted Lincoln powers that had never been used by a previous President. However, this instant form of communication and his authoratative style of managing his resources revolutionized the methods in which war is organized and executed by field generals and their commanders. "],"display_date":"April 9, 1864 - April 22, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-15","locations":[{"id":52917,"lat":32.0842949,"lng":-93.3792057,"zoom":8,"place":"Red River LA"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":2987,"tag":"Washington"},{"id":2986,"tag":"Louisiana"},{"id":2985,"tag":"Banks"},{"id":2984,"tag":"General"},{"id":2983,"tag":"Red Rivers"},{"id":2982,"tag":"Mansfield"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6525,"title":"Abraham Lincoln vs. New York World Newspaper","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-18","end_date":"1864-05-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the course of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was responsible for shutting down more than 300 newspapers (1). In a telegram sent to Major General Dix on May 18th, 1864, Lincoln orders military occupation of the New York World newspaper for something that was \"wickedly and traitorously printed and published,\" (1). In another telegram sent on May 18th, 1864, it is discovered that a forged document of some kind was printed in the newspaper (2). This document was a fake proclamation by Lincoln to add 400,00 troops to the Northern army (2). The Department of State quickly released a statement claiming the document was false, and Lincoln ordered an immediate shut down of the newspaper (2). It was later discovered that a man named Joseph Howard, a known prankster, was behind the forged document (2)."," ","In the telegrams sent on May 18th, 1864, it is clear that the newspaper printed a forged document that contained both Lincoln and his Secretary of War's signatures (2). An actual forged document could have raised some legal questions in regards to forgery on part of the newspaper, and most would agree that legal action should be taken in the event of forged documents. However, it was not always a forged document that caused Lincoln to shut down newspapers or detain editors without hearings. Newspapers like the New York World often heavily disagreed with Lincoln's policies and the war in general. Lincoln also suspended the writ of habeus corpus, even though Chief Justice Roger Tanney ruled this unconstitutional, citing that only Congress had the power to do so (3). Lincoln’s suppression of the New York World newspaper and other media outlets caused some controversy regarding First Amendment rights during the war, and has even sparked some modern controversy in the eye of public memory. Judgment aside, it is clear that Abraham Lincoln felt it necessary to suppress certain messages during a time of war."," ","1. \"The Lincoln Telegrams Project.\" <a href=\"http://wiki.lincolntelegrams.com/index.php?title=May_18,_1864_\">http://wiki.lincolntelegrams.com/index.php?title=May_18,_1864_</a>(2)","2. \"The Lincoln Telegrams Project.\" <a href=\"http://wiki.lincolntelegrams.com/index.php?title=May_18,_1864_\">http://wiki.lincolntelegrams.com/index.php?title=May_18,_1864_</a>(3)","3. \"Civil War tested Lincoln's tolerance for free speech, press.\" First Amendment Center. 2009. <a href=\"http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/civil-war-tested-lincolns-tolerance-for-free-speech-press\">http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/civil-war-tested-lincolns-tolerance-for-free-speech-press</a>"],"display_date":"May 18, 1864","search_date":"1864-05-18","locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.7155787,"lng":-74.0148434,"zoom":8,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2992,"tag":"Press"},{"id":2273,"tag":"Newspaper"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6526,"title":"An Officer and a President: Black Soldiers in the Civil War","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-11","end_date":"1865-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The Union military of which President Lincoln was Commander and Chief was much different than our military today.  Upper officer ranks were extremely politicized and often hard for Presidents to control. A major area where Union officers’ political ambitions were apparent was in the recruitment of black soldiers to fight against the South.","   On February 11<sup>th</sup>, 1865, Lincoln sent a telegram to Major General Ord ordering the suspension of sentencing on Major T.C. Jameson, who was accused of embezzelment and other financial malpractices which would result in major fines and a loss of commission.  In this particular instance, the situation was very shady because of the political ramifications involved.  By criminalizing Major Jameson, other high ranking officers were able to collect the political currency provided by taking credit for organizing a widely successful recruitment campaign for black soldiers in eastern North Carolina.  Several respected people came forward as character witnesses for Major Jameson who fervently denied any wrongdoing.  Consequently, Major Jameson was fined but none of his accussers gained the political benefits they were seeking.","  In another example in Kentucky, the recruitment of black soldiers is a little more scandalous. Lincoln sent a telegram to Major General Thomas on June 18<sup>th</sup>, 1864 with clear instructions to investigate malpractices involving the recruitment of black soldiers.  In the telegram, he specifically talks about reports of General Thomas’ army carrying off black people without their consent to fight for the Union in Kentucky.  Obviously, President Lincoln would be concerned about this because he is fighting against the Confederacy and the system of slavery it embodies, so having his army forcing people to do things against their will would be a public relations nightmare, not to mention the immorality of it.  As for the officers in the Army, “recruiting” black men both swelled their numbers for combat and provided political currency in the form of integrating blacks into the army (albeit against their will in this case).  Lincoln specifically states that the army has been carrying men off “according to no rules whatever, except those of absolute violence”.  By telegramming this to General Thomas, his intentions as Commander and Chief have been made abundantly clear so refusal to follow his direction would be directly violating his superior.","  In a world without Lincoln’s use of the telegram, his army’s operations would be totally under the discretion of the commanding officers.  Without Lincoln’s fervent use of the telegram to stay on top of things, he probably would not have knowledge of such actions occurring on his watch.  Moreover, without his use of the telegram he would not be able put the responsibility on his Generals with such immediacy to rectify these situations.  Not only must he control his officers in a military sense, but he must control the political fallout of their actions as well.  In both of these examples, President Lincoln is utilizing the telegram to investigate, halt, or change the methods of his army, particularly his officers.  He would have been seen as responsible for the actions of the Army as President by the public, good or bad, and in using the telegram, Lincoln was able to make sure that those actions were truly his directives rather than the whims of ambitious Generals making foolhardy decisions.   "," "," "],"display_date":"June 11, 1864 - April 9, 1865","search_date":"1864-11-08","locations":[{"id":52919,"lat":35.610947,"lng":-77.368281,"zoom":8,"place":"Eastern North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2993,"tag":"Black Recruitment"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6528,"title":"The Presidential Election of 1864","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-18","end_date":"1864-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["      In the fourth year of the American Civil War, the country found itself in a pivotal moment in history. With no certainty of how long the nation would remain engaged in a bloody stalemate, the American citizens had the power to steer themselves out of political, militant, social and economic unrest. The Election of 1864 poised the Confederacy-backed Democratic Party against Republican and incumbent President Abraham Lincoln who endured a significant amount of the burden for causing the great divide between North and South, Union and Confederacy. This essay will use the recently digitized telegrams used in communication between Lincoln and his Union officials & colleagues to evaluate the mental state of the president through his writing style. Specifically, the telegrams with implications for Lincoln's reelection in 1864 will serve as the primary basis for analysis, although a myriad of other influences will be discussed in the evaluation of Lincoln's writing and mental health.","      One of the most salient factors that contributed to the nation's divide was slavery and its monetary ramifications for the agricultural economy of the South. Lincoln, above all, was a man who adhered to the law, no matter its accordance with morality and humanity. Moreover, though he is revered as \"The Great Emancipator,\" it is inaccurate to attribute the feat of abolition to Lincoln himself, especially given his 1860 campaign's promise to avoid interfering with slavery in states that already permitted its existence (Wilson). However, as President of the United States, he found that certain issues arising from the disagreement on slavery forced the nation into disarray and it was his job to restore order within, despite the unpopularity or disdain his efforts often attracted. In his inquiry of the treatment of African Americans in Kentucky, Lincoln telegraphed Major General Thomas to further investigate the matter (June 13, 1864). Thomas, a slave-owner, most likely did not oppose slavery, but was an authoritative figure within the Union Army and therefore was expected to follow moral, humane and, most importantly, lawful conduct. Lincoln, employing exculpatory yet urgent diction in his telegram, revealed no signs of confidence or understanding that this behavior was occurring but rather kindly warned the general that this matter must be fixed and prohibited immediately.","      Slavery was just one matter in which many disagreed with Lincoln's ideologies. In a telegraph sent to Governor of Indiana Oliver Morton, Lincoln communicated the need for the \"hundred day troops'\" advancement in search of strengthening General Sherman's campaign in Atlanta (May 21, 1864 (2)). Despite the high level of Lincoln's unpopularity at this point in time, the cooperation of government officials in several Union states in this matter represented the Union's agreement with Lincoln's war goals as well as a sense of political unity despite personal opinions. His writing remained formal, mannerly and optimistic, all of which contribute to this cooperation of government officials.","      One prominent characteristic observed through Lincoln's writing is the confidence he exhibits in all matters. As commander in chief, Lincoln asserts his authority through his communicative abilities (i.e., the telegram). No matter his receiver, his writing is almost always polite but urgent, noting a sense of importance in every matter he inquires about. The few exceptions to this observation reveal Lincoln's surmounting pressure to be reelected in a time of war and political/economic turmoil.","      First, in a telegram addressed to Major General Dixon (NY), Lincoln rebuked a New York-based newspaper for its publication of a \"false and suspicious proclamation\" that purported the President's plans in aiding the rebellious enemies (May 18, 1864 (2)). Not only is Lincoln's tone and vocabulary indicative of his frustration, but his orders for Dixon to seize military control of the publication establishment supports the reports of Lincoln having \"suppressed more than 300 newspapers\" during the war (Bulla, 2009).","      Similarly, in a letter to Horace Greeley (a NY newspaper editor), Lincoln first made explicit his \"disappointment\" in Greeley, feeling as he has been disrespected (July 15, 1864). Beyond this word choice, Lincoln's disappointment is apparent when he underlined two active verbs (send & bring). This illustrated the distinction between Lincoln's intentions and Greeley's actions regarding an obviously important conference between Lincoln and Confederate delegates. Lincoln's feeling of disrespect is then demonstrated by his decision to have his assistant John Hay manage this situation with Greeley rather than himself. Both of these outbursts occurred in 1864 and reveal Lincoln's recognition of the power of newspapers to report--and perhaps propagandize--information that could hinder the success of he and his administration, especially during a period of civil unrest.","      As the election drew closer, Lincoln still performed exceptionally as both a leader and a family man. Utilizing the telegram's immediacy, his constant communication with officials dispersed throughout the nation represented his desire to be involved in the decision-making process. This communication also allows for inferences to be drawn: Is his constant communication a sign of distrust in his appointed generals and officials? Has Lincoln become obsessed with the war efforts that he has neglected his other duties as President, husband & father?","      Many of his telegrams addressed to government officials and generals inquired about planned sentences & executions of war criminals, both Union and Confederates. Although he asked for many to be suspended or respited, it is not a compensation for his subordinates' lack of judgment but instead a thoughtful consideration of the implications that executions may hold for a politician who seeks reelection as POTUS. More often than not, Lincoln yearned to be included in the process but left the ultimate judgment in those directly involved, which is supported by his decision to allow Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and General Sherman determine how many soldiers can be released without weakening Sherman's position (October 13, 1864). Clearly, the soldiers who were released were of great political value to Lincoln and his administration now that they could vote in-person, but their absence in the field of battle was feared by Lincoln and therefore configured by Stanton & Sherman.","      In telegrams such as the ones dated September 8th, September 11th and October 11th of 1864, Lincoln's communicative efforts in family affairs is clear. Uncertain of Mrs. Lincoln receiving his first telegram to Vermont, he followed up three days later to report to his wife (now in NY) the updates of his health, their son Tad's goats, the death of a family friend and the travel of eldest son, Robert. A month later Lincoln reached out to Robert about their concern for his well-being and expressed his paternal instinct by planning to visit rather than depend on the communication that has helped he and the Union so much throughout the war. This observation is incredibly minute but highly indicative of the person Lincoln strived to be: involved.","      The legacy of Abraham Lincoln is one that people only dream of. He led a divided nation through a civil war and is credited with dismantling the institution of slavery. Yet, what few people realize is, some scholars have diagnosed him with depression. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) even uses him as a motivational story to encourage others who battle the disease today. In an interview, Joshua Shenk, author of <em>Lincoln's Melancholy</em> argues that Lincoln's battles with depression made him one of the best government officials (Cohen). Understanding that modern scholars believe the President Lincoln suffered from clinical depression changes the way one thinks about him. No where in this collection of telegrams does one find any sign of the magnitude of his mental health. Granted, they are short messages, it is impressive that if the diagnosis be correct, that Lincoln was able to exert power in an effective manner while still, in most cases, retain a sense of respect for the recipients.","      No matter the topic discussed or the role Lincoln played in each individual telegram, his dedication and consistency are irrefutable. Although some in-depth analyses of Lincoln's writing may reveal depression and other unappealing qualities overtime, this analysis proves that Lincoln maintained order and control in a time of disparity. Furthermore, his goals as president were too great to be achieved in one term and he craved a second term to help propel the country out of disunity, which is most apparent in his undaunted efforts to continuously bring an end to the war while securing his reelection as President of the United States. Lincoln's unwavering ability to communicate via the telegram proved advantageous for the Union in the Civil War. Moreover, his persistent awareness, kindness and generosity demonstrated through his writing revered him as a man of great respect, authority and leadership. At times, Lincoln revealed human-like symptoms of frustration, fear and uncertainty in his writing. However, with distance and countless responsibilities separating him from his family and blatantly different opinions dividing the nation, President Lincoln failed to surrender. In a time of absolute chaos, two-term President Abraham Lincoln prevailed as a political, economic and social reformer committed to restoring the United States of America."],"display_date":"May 18, 1864 - November 8, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-13","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2996,"tag":"Telegram communication"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2980,"tag":"1864"},{"id":1875,"tag":"Presidential Election"},{"id":3021,"tag":"Writing Style"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6529,"title":"Lincoln: Mastermind in Chief","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-07-02","end_date":"1864-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Abraham Lincoln was an apparent genius. He had the ability to tend to a country divided by political differences and opinions, act as a commander in chief, and skillfully direct generals. He did this concomitantly as he anticipated the needs of the war effort, used the most advanced and up-to-date technology to communicate orders, and tended to the matter of humanity. Combined, this assets point to his almost superhuman-like quality of leadership. In order to see this in action one simply needs to examine and analyze President Lincoln’s Daily Agenda and communications through telegraph to various entities. Our focus will primarily be on the 2nd of July 1864.","On July 2nd 1864 Abraham Lincoln had quite a full day. His activity, to our knowledge, began at 7:50 am with two telegrams to Honorable D. Davis and Honorable S.H. Treat.[1] He was seeking each man's \"summary of the evidence, with [their] impression, on the Coles County [Illinois] riot cases.\" The background story on this is that on March 28, in Charleston, members of the 54th Illinois Infantry clashed with area Democrats and a riot ensued. Nine people died, including six soldiers and three citizens. Twelve people were wounded. [2] Sending out these telegraphs was only the start to a very full day for President Lincoln. But in the first two telegraphs of the day he has already dealt with, at least in a small portion, political differences that divide the country. We can see as he moves from each part of his day to the next that this is not just haphazard but masterfully planned.","Lincoln seems aware that every minute of his day counts as well as his every action. According to reports of Lincoln’s daily agenda, he also confers with Cong. Julian (Ind.) on power of Congress to confiscate landed estates of Confederates. [2] Here Lincoln is moving to political issues that again could ultimately prove divisive in a future reconciliation. Also, the records show that Lincoln transmits to Senate information regarding African slave trade. This shows that Lincoln was forward thinking and not just in the moment.","In addition to his growing agenda, he met with Former Sen. Fessenden (Maine), who was newly nominated to the position of secretary of treasury. According to sources, it was a “long interview with President at White House.” [2] No office was too small for Lincoln’s attention and here he is careful to masterfully choose and place people in authority that he wanted and sometimes needed in so he could move forward with his war machine. Continuing in his ability to operate as a genius leader he speaks directly with Gen. Meigs regarding Ft. Leavenworth [2] which is key at this point to the Union cause. Lincoln puts on his commander-in-chief hat here to make sure that things are going according to plan. Next, the President approves an act granting lands to aid in construction of railroad and telegraph line from Lake Superior to Puget's Sound on Pacific coast. This is a military move that will help Lincoln secure an eagle eye view of the country and put him with in the heat of conflict in moments. It was also a genius move as it is giving Lincoln a legacy of being a builder of infrastructure and a president who ultimately wants his country to be technologically advanced. While all of this has gone in one day of President Lincoln’s life, he is still a husband and a father; hence, he must attend to the needs of his family. On this particular day, Mrs. Lincoln and Robert arrive home from an assumed extended trip. The President knows he must tend to his own family as well so he and the family begin summer residence at Soldiers' Home.","By looking at his July 2nd agenda as president, one can see that Lincoln had to be a mastermind. As president he was simultaneously contemplating the decisions he had to make concerning a country divided by political differences, acting as a commander in chief, and skillfully directing generals. He did this all while anticipating the needs of the war effort and still having time to tend to his family. To think that he did this day after day no wonder he appeared to have aged a lifetime in a few short years. But his ability to keep it all together, day after day, was a sign of leadership genius."],"display_date":"July 2, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-02","locations":[{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":12,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":1185,"tag":"War Department"},{"id":2976,"tag":"Telegram"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6555,"title":"The Gullah and Geechee People after the Port Royal Expeirment.","course_id":160,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1/1/61","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Port Royal Experiment along with the collapse of the Confederacy brought about unfamiliar freedom to the slaves of the Savannah, Bluffton, Beaufort, and Hilton Head Island area who were now allowed to buy and obtain property.

The <em>USS Housatonic</em> sank to the bottom of the sea, a victim to the first successful submarine attack. However, she would not sink alone. <em>The Hunley</em> did not return to shore to bask in the glory of her achievement. She and her crew of eight would be lost to the waves for over a hundred years. The Hunley had sunken to the deep thrice in her lifetime, killing her crews each time. One of these would include the principle designer and creator, Horace Lawson Hunley. However, this was not the end to the Hunley’s tale. Stories would be told of the famed submarine that would then reach the ears of author, adventure seeker, and founder of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) Clive Cussler. Cussler is a man with a mind that functions, in his own words as written in July 1980, “left of delirium and right of monomania.” To Cussler, there was no greater thrill than that of the ocean’s discovery. His first attempt at finding the lost ship would be away from the site of the <em>USS Housatonic</em>’s wreckage as he had reports by the deck officers of the vessel that the Hunley had backed away some 50-100 feet before the explosion. His first search in 1980 would yield no results."," ","            Cussler’s third expedition, from June 1994 to May 1995, would prove different.

When they resurfaced, they were instructed by Cussler to photograph their dig for authentication. On the first of May, 1995, the <em>Hunley</em> had been found."," ","            Finding the ship, though a challenge, was the easy part. The real question was how to move a multi-ton, rusting, and fragile piece of history from the bottom of the ocean back to the surface. This task fell to the NUMA group using technology from Oceaneering International Inc. Cussler donated $50,000 to the effort, but the ocean refused to make it easy.

Five years prior, John R. Phillips set out to purchase a house and lot owned by one Mrs. Hooker. Working through an agent for Mrs. Hooker, Amos Harvey, Phillips purchased the homestead for $2500 in cash. Everything was written out in a contract notarized by L. H. Alredge. A simple, yet legally sound deed transferred the property from Mrs. Hooker to John Phillips. The only problem was, it was paid for in Confederate bank notes. This seemed perfectly fine in 1862 with the war being waged and the Confederate States holding their own against the Union forces. In 1867, after the defeat of the Confederacy and the official labeling of the CSA as treason, Confederate bank notes thought to be ‘illegal tender’. As a result, Mrs. Hooker tried to take her land back on the grounds that the contract was invalid and she had not been paid in acceptable currency. Phillips disputed this and the two found themselves before the Supreme Court of North Carolina.","            The question the Court had to discuss was the validity of the transaction using rebel currency. Did the rebel bank notes hold real value or were they worthless prints from a defunct government? In a way, they were both. The bank notes, at their height, could exchange a dollar of gold for under two dollars. By putting the Confederate bank note to the gold standard, it allowed for quick exchange and transaction, while also backing the notes in a currency useable in any part of the world (provided the bank in question actually had the gold to back it up). With the defeat of the Confederate States of America, the “Confederate” banks no longer existed so the notes became relatively worthless.<em> Became</em> being the operative word. From 1861 until the end of the war, the Confederate bank note was legal tender in any of the Confederate States and could be used for taxes and other exchanges within the Confederacy. After that, the United States had to take stock on the Confederate bank notes and allowed exchanges for Union greenbacks in certain situations, like in New Orleans, after the war had ended. That said, the Confederate notes themselves were never actually declared illegal; rather, they were lumped together with the legislation nullifying contracts that attempted to aid the rebellion. This legal condition appeared in the Supreme Court’s decision: “The Convention was prompt to declare that the rebellion and everything in aid of it was illegal. And it declared void all contracts which were in aid of it; but it did not declare void all contracts, the consideration of which were Confederate treasury notes.” As Phillips’s exchange with Mrs. Hooker did not aid the Rebellion’s cause and was just a land transfer, it remained in effect. The Court ruled in favor of Phillips."],"display_date":"December 13, 1862 - November 1, 1867","search_date":"1865-05-23","locations":[{"id":52803,"lat":35.7795897,"lng":-78.6381787,"zoom":8,"place":"Raleigh, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1584,"tag":"courts"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6646,"title":"Advancement of Women in the American Civil War","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-12","end_date":"1894-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Unknown to many in contemporary society, the American Civil War presented women with wondrous advancements in civil rights as the war challenged America’s culturally held notions of women’s role in society. By having the pertinent need of a labor force in almost all fields, women completed the task that drafted men were not able to do so. So as new opportunities were presented to them, women began to obtain more rights than any other previous generation had experienced; being able to manage farms and businesses for the first time. This however was not limited to domestic affairs as women also were heavily involved in espionage, the nursing of soldiers, the raising of capital via the ladies’ and soldier’s aid societies, the U.S sanitary commission, (a private agency in the North that played a critical role in the Union’s victory) and battlefield; a considerable amount of women partook in cross-dressing to enlist themselves. With these outstanding accomplishments, women were forever advanced in society as founder of the Red Cross Barton claimed that had the continuous peace prevailed, the advancement of women’s rights would have remained stagnant in society for at least fifty years. With that the American Civil War inspired individuals to contemplate, and re-think their previously held notions of what a woman was capable of performing as many leaders emerged such as Harriet Tubman and Susie King Taylor.","Delivered passionately by feminist Civil Rights activist in 1894, Josiah Benton Jr. spoke eloquently of the societal advancement the Civil War presented women. By speaking in simple terms, using statistics and emotional appeal the speech was monumentally successful in that it informed the public of the accomplishments of women and the needed continued advancement towards equality. Reminding individuals that men had to evacuate shops, offices, businesses, and banks by the literal thousands only to be run efficiently by women,  the competency of women was once more re-established, and spoken of. Many deeming women unfit to perform the same task as men, all notions of superiority where disproven when even members in the National and State department had their jobs temporarily preformed by women with success. This demonstrated to all that women could maintain order, exceed in domestic and external affairs, regulate capita, and compete with men. Regarding African American women, many were not able to exhibit the same advancements as other women-even those that were also impoverished. So while many were able to learn how to read and write, and at times even pass on that knowledge, it their advancement pales in comparison to the continued adversity they continued to face. Unfortunately many continued to be viewed as hindrances in both the Union and Confederacy.","Louisa May Alcott wrote extensively about her experiences as a nurse during the American Civil War. Nurses typically being what most individuals think of when they image women during the tremulous war, it is undoubtedly due to the large amount of volunteers both the Union and Confederacy received from women. Being motivated to make their presence valuable, many wholeheartedly cared deeply for their patients as they treated gruesome wounds. May Alcott claiming that the nurses had “ a motherly affection for all,” while the women cooked, cleaned, bathed, and wrote for the soldiers, it challenged the notion that women could not multitask well; performing difficult surgeries all the while being responsible for their mental health and emotional well-being.","Submissiveness and domesticity was arguably most challenged when women began to cross-dress and enlist in the military. First seen in July 1863 when Union soldiers found a dead female body disguised as a confederate private in a mass grave. Shocked, as many did not believe women were capable of deceiving men, and fighting, it was originally thought by all that women who cross-dressed were anomalies. Historians now know that this is not the case as a conservative estimate shows now that between four-hundred to seven hundred fifty women disguised themseleves. Scholars now agree that women who fought on the battlefield did so with the same motivations that men had, with the exception of a few who did so in order to obtain freedom from domestic submissiveness, and to be with their loved one. With the Victorian notions of modesty, it made it fairly easy for women to disguise themselves as men as many were given ill-fitting clothing that hid their body shape, were encouraged to sleep with clothed, shower separately, and use the lavatory separately. All of these factors helped women contribute to the war effort as it made it easy for them to enter the battlefield.","Overall the American Civil War allowed women to gain wondrous advancements in civil rights as they were allowed to engage in many domestic and foreign affairs that previously would have not been accessible to them. So while they fought bravely on the battlefield, engaged in dangerous surgery, managed businesses, farms, and taught and learnt literature, the minds of women were significantly expanded. This led many to be inspired to re-think women’s role in society. So with the lives of American women “being shaped by a set of ideas that historians refer to as the cult of womanhood” American cultural notions of femininity were forever changed as the introduction of a new set of ideas inspired those to re-think the capabilities of women. The importance of their role cannot be overstated."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"April 12, 1861 - July 1, 1894","search_date":"1877-11-20","locations":[{"id":52839,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6647,"title":"A Portrait of Failure","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-10-16","end_date":"1859-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["This portrait of John Brown, the leader of the Raid on Harper’s Ferry in October of 1859, was drawn by an artist named David Hunter Strother after John Brown’s execution. and was published in Harper’s Weekly in June of 1866 and April of 1868. This was seen as important because it caused remembrance of the situation of Harper’s Ferry and how it was a key event in the Abolition of Slavery and the start of the Civil War. The other source used recounts how troubled past of the Brown family. It is an excerpt from an essay, by a professor named  Robert E. McGlone of the University of Hawaii, called Rescripting a Troubled Past: John Brown's Family and the Harpers Ferry Conspiracy, which was published in the Journal Of American History.","Going back to October of the year 1859, abolitionist John Brown, alongside other abolitionists, crossed the border of Maryland into Virginia. Brown took control of an United States arsenal at Harper’s Ferry. His hope was to arm slaves and have them break free. His mission, ultimately a failure as General Robert E. Lee and his platoon of Marines thwarted Brown’s plans and captured him, whilst killing off most of his men including Brown’s two sons. This ultimately led to Brown being tried for treason against the state of Virginia. The governor at the time, Henry A. Wise, gave permission for Brown to be hanged after finding him guilty. Finding him guilty, ultimately ended the cause according the McGlone’s essay.","Robert E. McGlone’s article praises Brown’s efforts for the abolition of slavery. He calls him a martyr for the cause. He praises his family for also being for this cause. His sons, Watson and Oliver, were also martyrs for this cause since they were killed during the firefight. McGlone also spoke on how the Browns came from nothing. They did not want credit for their doings, they just wanted slavery to be done with. He went on to talk about how the family did not receive any sort of credit. Their cause died with John Brown’s failure. Why should this receive any attention? They are saying this needs to receive attention because it pushed the nation into the direction of war between these two sides.","These events caused a huge stir in the South. Slave owners were terrified of something like this happening tothem. It also caused a discourse amongst political leaders. It stirred up massive amounts of tension between freestates and slave states. This also was a cause that called the attention to state laws and federal laws, and whichone overruled the other. Although this was not a key event to starting what later would be called the Civil War, itwas a push in that direction. This event more or less sounded a warning alarm of what was to come in the nextdecade. The portrait used was used to keep Brown’s cause alive.

For most people, it’s Jackie Robinson back in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers.  What if I told you that African Americans had been playing baseball for more than 100 years before that? Back in the 1840’s through the 1850’s, African Americans formed clubs and played baseball all the way up until the time of the Civil War in 1865, but, just like 100 years later, African Americans would still have to face obstacles such as racism and discrimination in the nascent game we now call baseball."," ","            Back in the 1840’s and 1850’s, many African Americans in the north were very poor and didn’t have time to be playing baseball. But, there were some that could spare the time to play. Clubs sprung up all over the north as well as the south too. From New York to New Orleans, African Americans were teaming up play this new sport. Many of the people on the teams that could play were teachers, clerks, and artisans."," ","            Then came 1865. The Civil War put a temporary hold on this new game, but the years following the civil war, African American baseball clubs picked back up were they left off. But just as predicted, the more they played, the more hate and discrimination they had to overcome. Many newspapers would ridicule the ball players and say horrible racist things about them. In 1862, a reporter said that, everyone in the large crowd was “as black as an ace of spades.” But this didn’t stop anyone from playing. The same reporter also mention the crowds who would come and watch the games. He noted that, “A number of old and well known players, who seemed to enjoy the game more heartily than if they had been the players themselves.”"," ","            All throughout the years of the war, leading up to it and following it, baseball was directly correlated to the civil rights to African Americans. “On July 4, 1859, Joshua Giddings, a white antislavery Republican congressman from Ohio, showed his support for desegregation and equality in baseball by playing in a game with African-Americans.” An elite African American baseball club known as the Philadelphia Pythian Baseball Club, were all activists for African American equal opportunity. “ In 1863 the club’s secretary, Jacob C. White Jr., and the shortstop and captain of its first nine, Octavius V. Catto, served on a committee that recruited soldiers for the Union Army and joined a local African-American militia. During the late 1860s Catto campaigned for the desegregation of Philadelphia’s streetcars and for blacks’ right to vote. After voting on Election Day of 1871, he encountered Frank Kelly, a Democratic Party supporter; the two got into a fight, and Kelly shot and killed Catto.” As shocking as this is, it was very common. Maybe not to that degree but African Americans were faced with many obstacles and hardships."," ","            The famed abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, had two sons, Frederick Douglass Jr. and Charles both played baseball during this time as well. In Rochester, New York, Frederick Douglass Jr., playing for an integrated baseball team called the Charter Oak Juniors and after the war, he founded Alerts Base Ball Club of Washington. And his brother, Charles was the third baseman for the team. In 1869, Charles joined the Washington’s Mutual Club."," "," “The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, ratified after the war, redefined state and federal citizenship and extended civil and political rights, but they included no provisions for equality in private, voluntary activities. Nevertheless, officers of the leading black clubs of Brooklyn, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington sought equal treatment by the white ball-playing fraternity. Some of them were on good terms with white club officials and frequently obtained permission to use their grounds for feature contests. White umpires sometimes officiated at their games. The Pythians enjoyed harmonious relations with the officers of the city’s powerful Athletics Base Ball Club, who gave them permission to use their field for major matches.” During the years leading up to the wars and the years following, African Americas fought for equal treatment among white baseball clubs. But there were many white baseball clubs did not want to play with all black teams. Saying they, “would have nothing to do with the dark votaries of the bat and ball.” Integrated games of baseball were not common. Except for one game that was put together by a name by the name of Thomas Fitzgerald, editor for a local newspaper called, “The City Item”. In this game, the Philadelphia Olympics played the Pythians, beating them 44-23. Leading many to say that “old-time prejudices were melting away in this country. Also, noting that interracial sporting events took place in England all the time. Another game involving integration, In September of 1870, Two clubs named, “The Resolutes”, One black and one white, fought for the right for the name. The black Resolutes won by an ashtonishing 25-15."," ","In 1870, baseball was on the upswing of becoming Americas favorite pastime, and just like everything else around it at the time – it was very segregated. Many African Americans would being playing professionally in the 1880’s, but it would be another 60 years until we would know the name, Jackie Robinson, breaking the color barrier for the final time, and completely changing the face of baseball as we know it."," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1840 - April 12, 1865","search_date":"1852-08-21","locations":[{"id":52989,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":8,"place":"New York"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":629,"tag":"race"},{"id":233,"tag":"Baseball"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6648,"title":"Union General William T.

The buildings that he did not have destroyed when his army came through were destroyed by the fires that had happened. During this march General Sherman took out a lot of Confederate soldiers. When General Sherman left Georgia, the Governor had sent an officer to Atlanta to assess the damage that was done.

Through time you can still see the divide amongst our society from the effects of the war and secession of the southern states. One state that played an influential role in the Confederate states was Virginia. Virginia is a very history rich state, the first colony was in the state of Virginia and many political leaders of America were Virginians. I believe it is very important to discuss why Virginia left the union because many battles and the surrender of the war happened in Virginia. I believe the three main factor behind the secession of Virginia is their ties with slavery and the roots of their southern culture.","            Slavery played a very important role in the time of the civil war. Virginia was the most populous state of the south and had very deep ties in the slave trade. Geography played a huge role for slavery in Virginia, the barrier which affected it was the Blue Ridge Mountains. East of the mountains slavery dominated, plantation agriculture ruled and was the main source of income for that area. The slave trade was also found its grounds in Virginia making huge headquarters in Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. William A. Link speaks in his book <em>Roots of Secession</em> and states “The entire Fabric of Virginia’s legal, constitutional, and political system was woven into the slave holding society, and the social interests and political imperatives converged around slavery.” This quote shoes the importance of slavery in the Virginian society and how they base their society around it.","            Even though Virginia was not the first to secede it had strong ties to its southern culture helped tip the balance when it came to the secession of Virginia. One aspect the kept the South so close is their pride in their society. The paternalistic ideals the south held kept unity across all of the southern states. The people of the south viewed the north as the people who wanted to start a revolution, and they were only doing what they believe was their right. In the <em>Declaration of Cause Secession of Virginia </em>it states “Having declared that the powers under the said Constitution were derived from the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensover the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression” In this quote, you can see that the people of Virginia felt that the southern way of live was being oppressed and it was there right to leave to preserve their rights.","            To conclude, the secession of Virginia was mostly motivated by their strong ties to slavery and the southern culture built around it. Though Virginia was not the first to secede, the state is home to many battles of the civil war and the surrender of the war. These events not only effected the people that lived during that time, they also will affect people for years to come. Even today the issues of the Civil War can still be seen throughout the country. The secession of the South played a pivotal role in the history of our country, and it will forever be studied and looked at by historians for years to come."," "," "],"display_date":"April 17, 1861 - April 1, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-09","locations":[{"id":14214,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":8,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6653,"title":"A New Beginning","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1888-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After examining the document To Colored Men, it can be said that this document explains what happened after the slaves were finally emancipated. The document goes on to describe the laws that were put in place to protect and enforce anti-slavery and some of the consequences if these laws were not followed. Also contained in this document are a few responses to the emancipation of slaves put in place by president Abraham Lincoln. While examining this document, it is proven that the emancipation of slaves created a gateway. The African American race was finally able to fight for what they believed in without a rather gruesome consequence such as a “whipping”. To Colored Men describes the beginning of freedom for the African American race and the opportunities that were received due to the emancipation of 1863.  ","On page one of the document, Abraham Lincoln gives a brief statement about how the government should provide protection for its citizens. When Lincoln made the statement, he was referring to every citizen regardless of race, class, or condition. Even though Lincoln said that all citizens should be protected, he emphasized the protection of one specific group, U.S soldiers. The emancipation meant absolutely no slavery, so if an enemy were to enslave a person because of his color, there would be brutal retaliation. The enemy were to remain enslaved until the person(s) of color were released.","As the document progressed, some of Lincoln’s servants responded to this new tactic referred to as “man for man”. For example, contained in one of the responses is a situation involving the capture of  three black soldiers. In the response, Lincoln’s loyal servant agreed to keep three rebel soldiers imprisoned until the others are freed.  During this time there was a zero tolerance policy on slavery. Retaliation had became the biggest practice of military forces in the year of 1863. Edwin M. Stanton made the statement  “ ..retaliation will be our practice now-man for man- to the bitter end.”. This statement meant that as long as their men were held captive, the more retaliation would be brought upon opposing forces. This also meant that they didn’t care about what the outcome would be, regardless they would still retaliate for their captured soldiers.","After the tactics and philosophy of the army were described, the document began to explain the benefits that African Americans would receive if  they had chosen  to enlist in the armed forces. When examining this section of the document, it seemed as if African Americans were treated the same as the Caucasian American. In reality they were. They received the same pay and the same benefits as the white males during this time. Some of the benefits are still provided to soldiers today. For example if a soldier were to be severely injured or to die, he and his family would receive “pensions” from the armed forces. They were even paid while enlisted regularly.","Also around this time, African Americans were some of the most fierce soldiers to step foot on a battlefield. For example, there was the Battle of  Honey Springs, Arkansas. The battle was between the First Kansas Colored Regiment and the 20th Texas Regiment.  The outcome of the battle was very unexpected. An army of colored soldiers took on an army that was twice its size. The Texas Regiment went into the battle with 300 soldiers and came out with 60. Through all of the times that African Americans were degraded, they had finally showed how strong and powerful they can be. It took a long time for the African American race to get to this point in history. This also proves that they had beat the odds and had that they are more than just a peasant or slave; they were warriors.","After examining To Colored Men, it can be said that this document explains the events following the emancipation of slaves along with the opportunities that came with it. The emancipation of slaves opened up many doors for the African American race. After the slaves were finally free, they showed people of  the U.S what they really were capable of. They fought in the armed forces and they never backed down despite their low number of soldiers that they had. This was the beginning of freedom for African Americans. The document comes to show that African Americans were in fact strong and that they were warriors.  African Americans had made great progress after gaining freedom, but there was more to come in their later years."],"display_date":"January 1, 1863 - January 1, 1888","search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":52950,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2824,"tag":"Charles Sumner"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":98,"tag":"Emancipation Proclamation"},{"id":3252,"tag":"1863"},{"id":3253,"tag":"Colored Troops"},{"id":3254,"tag":"Enlistment Poster"},{"id":3255,"tag":"Recruitment Poster"},{"id":3256,"tag":"Edwin M.

Although many people remained loyal to the side which they lived, there were few who went against the grain. Many soldiers had already been in the military belonging to certain battalions, divisions. Because of this, soldiers had the opportunity to befriend individuals from both the Union and the Confederate, before there was such. Ideologies were not split evenly between Union, and Confederate lines, but between individual consciousness. There has been enough evidence of friends against each other in the war, such as Wesley Culp, and Jack Skelly who grew up as close friends in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Many documents show the division amongst friends and brothers. This is evident in an exchange between Confederate soldier Braxton Bragg, and Union soldier Henry Hunt. The two soldiers are friends have two completely different allegiances and causes to fight for. While they still addressed each other as friends, they strongly supported their cause and made sure their comrade understood why the Union or the Confederate ideologies were correct.","            One of the biggest disagreements between the two were the cause for war.  An observation of the letters between Bragg, and Hunt aid understanding in allegiances that caused divisions in family and friendships. In exchange from Bragg and Hunt, it is evident that the two were not simply acquaintances, but considered one another brothers “A few short months since companions in army, and almost brothers in friendship, it is hard to realize the fact that we [inserted: are] in hostile array against each other”.  Bragg believed that the war was not started by or for politicians, but rather for the people, stating, “The people, en–mass, are the leaders – and every man is now united in the cause.” Bragg strongly agreed that the war was for the common good of the people, and that the war simply defended the cause of the South. He also argued that the war was not started by the South, but it was the desire of the North to start the war. These would be two key factors in his letter to Hunt."," Hunt, on the other hand, believed that the war was started by the elite and for the elite. Hunt believed that the war had lost it’s original purpose, and was not for the common good of the Union, but simply acting upon the retaliation of the South. Stating “A democrat of the [illegible] school I now believe that the party was broken up simply to bring about secession, and unfortunately the course of events in the south has enabled the leaders to drag the people with them.” For Hunt to express this to one who was nearly a brother it is evident that the two could not look past their differences in ideology about the Civil War. The discord between family and friends makes this war even more intense. ","             Another article describes the story of two people who grew up as best friends in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania but still ended up fighting against each other. An article by Jay Bellamay shows the intense event of occasions that rose because of the Civil War. Intertwined with love, betrayal, and eventually death, it is evident that the Civil War ruined family and friends forever. The sting of betrayal still lingers, and the causes of the war still change, but one thing is true, that the Civil War was a bitter war with diverging ideologies that will never waver."],"display_date":"April 21, 1861 - April 23, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-22","locations":[{"id":53021,"lat":30.327303,"lng":-87.290514,"zoom":8,"place":"fort pickens"},{"id":53020,"lat":30.421309,"lng":-87.2169149,"zoom":8,"place":"pensacola, florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3266,"tag":"Disagreements"},{"id":3265,"tag":"Friendship"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6656,"title":"The Rise of Ulysses S.

After the war had ended, he was forced to be stationed far from his family in remote regions. Drinking became his way to pass time which lead to him being viewed poorly. In 1854 He resigned from his position in the military to avoid being kicked out.","Grant, having to fall back onto his family to survive, moved to St. Louis, Missouri. He made many attempts to keep his family afloat in society being a farmer and other odd jobs. Eventually he was forced to move to his family’s business in Galena, Illinois where he took up the position of a clerk at the store. The Civil War began in 1861 and Grant rushed to join and regain his lost glory.","            First, he was stationed as a colonel of the 21<sup>st</sup> Illinois Infantry. Grant proved himself a great leader which allowed for him to climb in the ranks. Quickly he managed to gain the brigadier general in July 1861 then, in September was given command of the whole Distract of Southeast Missouri. In 1862 Grant earned the nickname “Unconditional Surrender” after his success in western Tennessee at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.","After being recognized for his excellent military prowess Grant was promoted to lieutenant-general and the next day took command of the Army of the Potomac. Grant arrived in Washington saying “It had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even if I was made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain there here was the point for the commanding general to be.” General Meade was the previous commander of the Army and even suggested that Grant replace him in his command with a general he knew better from the west. This changed Grants view of Meade for the better stating “It is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.”","April 6<sup>th</sup> 1862 Grant suffered great losses at the Battle of Shiloh after being overpowered by 40,000 confederate soldiers on the first day of fighting. They fell back to a defensive position on a road the position was known as the “Hornet’s Nest” the rebels were not able to break the position and their general, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, was mortally wounded and was replaced by P.G.T. Beauregard. On April 7<sup>th</sup>, Federal reinforcements came and helped overwhelm the Confederates. This was the bloodiest battle in the United States history at that point and caused many to call for Grant to be removed from command President Lincoln defended him saying “I can’t spare this man. He fights.”","Like any military campaign, Grant had his victories and losses. Grant taking over command of the Army of the Potomac was important for not only showing his strength but also the strength of the union.

Before this amendment, it was difficult for African Americans to get anything.","The Government at this time created many regulations that disabled African Americans from voting. Through a series of loopholes that were used to discriminate against them, African Americans still pushed for an amendment to be written up.

These sort of tests were not given to white people either, only African Americans. Basically, African Americans were back where they started when they were freed.

So while blacks did have the right to vote, it was so hard for them to actually vote because of all the tests and regulations that were solely established upon them.

This address takes place at union cemetery after the Battle of Gettysburg and is meant to help mourn the loss of the soldiers that died, but it did way more than that. The Gettysburg address is one of the most important speeches given during the time of the civil war. This speech encapsulates everything that the United States was struggling with during that time. Abraham Lincoln is able to use this speech as a sign of hope for the thousands of people who have lost it.","The Gettysburg address embodies what our country stands for but also show why the United States is a great country. Though the struggle of the war was at its climax Lincoln was able to bring a sense of security to the people of the union. The beginning of this speech sets the tone for the message Lincoln is trying to convey. In his address he states “Four score and seven years ago our father brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that “all men are created equal”.” In this infamous quote he is trying to make the statement that this country is founded on the principle of equality and he plans to do all he can to make it stay that way. So many people in the country at that time just wanted the country to come back together on the principles it was founded on.","Another point Lincoln tries to make in his address is that you can’t forget the events that are unfolding throughout the war. He says “ That we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government by the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from earth.” Lincoln is trying to tell the people of the union and the rest of the divided country that we have to protect the principles that the men on the battlefield are fighting for, and we can’t let them die in vain. He also sends a beacon of hope to many people throughout saying that we are still a country for the people and it will not change."," ","To conclude, the Gettysburg Address is one of the most influential speeches of its time and it is still known around the United States today. Lincoln was able to convey a message of hope and determination when it was hard to have either of them. He spoke of the principle our countries were founded on and why we cannot forget the importance of each event of the Civil War. The effect of this war still echoes throughout our everyday lives.

With this lamentable fact, human casualties are an inevitable aspect of warfare. This universal truth can best be seen during the American Civil War; a domestic conflict that caused immense human suffering. Being documented extensively by both the Union and Confederacy, the physical trauma and living conditions the wounded soldiers faced can be heavily studied. By looking at the practices prior to, during, and after the civil war, considerable advancements in the practice of medicine, germ theory, equipment, and hospitalization systems can be observed as the demand for improvements became particularly severe during this tremulous time period. With this originally unprecedented need of organized hospitalization, the American Civil War helped project the study of medicine, and antiseptic medical practices into the modern age as many discoveries, and  advancements were made by prominent figures.  ","It is tragic in our contemporary society to know that as many of one third of the deaths experienced during the American Civil War could have been prevented had the facilities caring for the wounded been properly prepared to battle infection. With many making military equipment a priority over medical equipment, many hospitals were ill fit to care for the thousands injured. Famed American author Walt Witlman described the gruesome living conditions many soldiers were subjected to as abominable stating that he saw, \" heaps of amputated feet, legs, hands\" as he spoke of the horrid smell of putrefying flesh. He also noted that many soldiers were shaking as their blankets did not protect them from the cold with many  not even able to cover their feet with them. In addition to this unfortunate fact, most surgeons did not have experience treating wounds; for ever solider that died of a gun wound, two died of a disease that resulted from an infection. This gross amount of ignorance created the perfect breeding ground for the spreading of infection as utensils were not disinfected (being shared amongst many individuals) physicians had an immense lack of knowledge on proper physical examinations, and the nurses did not have access to give the soldiers proper clothing and nutrition.  ","On September 21st a disheartened soldier by the name of Adam wrote to his mother and father about his adversities. Stating that he had “no blanket nor any clothes,” his depiction of life inside military camps is all too similar to those that documented their stay. Speaking of the little medical supplies present, and wounds of those around him, while it appears that he is censoring certain aspects of life for the sake of not worrying his parents, it is still very evident that all is not well within the facilities. Another individual by the name of John Redfield wrote a bit more openly about his difficulties to his family as he described his journey in Harper’s Fery claiming that since his battles his hearing and vision have considerably worsen. Unable to provide him with proper treatment at the hospital camps, for soldier Mr. Redfield, his health unfortunately only deteriorated.  ","Understanding the need for advancement, it was only after considerable deaths that doctors began to organize themselves and begin to contemplate the dire situation. So with everything about the medical procedures during the warring period being abhorred, the pus stained coats, and bloodied equipment were slowly evaluated as connections started forming. It was at this time that Johnathan Letterman improved the ambulance transportation system, which previously was frustratingly disorganized, causing many to die during their wait. With this improvement came the introduction of anesthesia; allowing more complicated surgeries to be performed on individuals such as amputations. This improvement helped significantly decrease the amount of suffering experienced by those who previously had to maintain consciousness during procedures. All due to the desire to lessen the amount of pain, many humanitarians congregated, and began to conceptualize and innovate. One exceptional individual that wrote the book on hygiene for the army during this time period was William A. Hammod, a general of the Union army. Understanding the connection between illness and cleanliness, General Hammod standardized and organized a system of hospital layouts and inspections. In addition to this humanitarian, and founder of the Red Cross Clara Barton was a well-known leader that advocated for the importance of efficient transportation systems to provide all with medical supplies.  ","By no means were the medical techniques exhibited throughout the war advanced. Many atrocities occurred that left thousands with curable illnesses dead due to lack of knowledge on antiseptic practices. This resulted in a death toll that is still spoken about in morbid awe today in our contemporary society. Needing to expand, and innovate on the study of medicine, it was undoubtedly due to this tragedy that the pace of progression that occurred happened as quickly as it did. The pertinent need of advancement helped progress the medical practices exhibited in the civil war to what we know observe and benefit from today. "],"display_date":"September 2, 1862 - January 1, 1863","search_date":"1862-11-01","locations":[{"id":53032,"lat":38.5976262,"lng":-80.4549026,"zoom":8,"place":"West Virginia, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6667,"title":"A Marriage License and its Properties","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Before and during the Civil War era, marriages were seen as a beneficial contract to, normally, the male spouse.

This comes at about five years after the end of the Civil War. Virginia, of course, leaving during 1861 to join and run the Confederate States of America, Richmond being the capital of the Confederate States. After the Confederacy lost, the whole United States had a long road to get things back to normal. Part of getting back to a sense of normalcy, is bringing the nation back together as it was before the war.","Some time after the war, there were Acts of Reconstruction put into place to bring back that sense of normal. These acts had certain requirements set in place in order to bring a state back into the Union. These states needed to ratify the 14th amendment which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” The state also needed to rewrite a new State Constitution and have it approved by the federal government. All Four Acts are as follows: Each district was to be headed by a military official empowered to appoint and remove state officials, Voters were to be registered; all freedmen were to be included as well as those white men who took an extended loyalty oath, State constitutional conventions, comprising elected delegates, were to draft new governing documents providing for black male suffrage, States were required to ratify the 14th Amendment prior to readmission.","All the states were approved by 1870. The president at this time, Andrew Johnson, was highly against these Acts. He felt it would soon rekindle the fire of aggression if the South went through with these changes. Even though he vetoed it multiple times, congress pushed through and passed all four of the Acts.","This proved to be a trying time during the aftermath of the Civil War. It took the length of the war itself to put the nation back into order.

In many cases, women were not considered equal. Many would believe that, that is true and that is exactly how it went, but those people would be wrong. In fact, many women actually fought in the Civil War. While many were either nurses, formed clubs and raised money for the troops, knitted blankets and scarfs, planted and canned vegetables for the troops or, some actually fought side-by-side the men in war. Almost 20,000 women worked directly with the Union Army and quite frankly, helped them win the war."," ","            Women played a very significant part in the Civil War. They fought on both sides, The Union and The Confederacy.

Besides, The Union had boys as young as 18 enlisting in the war. Just like them, women had smooth faces and high pitched voices, no one really noticed. "," ","            Although serving your country is very heroic, many who were discovered to actually be women, were often sent home and even imprisoned. Many people thought that once discovered, there would be some sort of mayhem. In reality, they were just sent home most of the time. The main way of becoming exposed was due to going to the infirmary and having the doctors or nurses founding out that you’re really a woman. There was a case where a woman who was a major in the war and was discovered to be a woman was a sentenced to jail time because of it.   "," ","            Another great story was the case of Jennie Hodgers, or Albert Cashier. “She enlisted in Illinois and she fought the entire Civil War without being discovered and ended up living out the rest of her life as a man for another fifty years.

Harvie discussed the secession by representing Amelia and Nottoway County, two counties that held seventy percent of their population in slavery. <br />","The picture above showed the slave population distribution in Virginia in 1860 based on the state's population. The map features the list of counties in Virginia and its population of whites, slaves, and a number of slaves in the county. It also shows Virginia western counties that are now part of West Virginia which were insignificant in slave population. It also showed the percentage of the slave population in Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains. Most of these counties plantations held more than fifty slaves. The Shenandoah Valley and the Appalachians had fewer due to the geography and environmental disadvantages that discouraged plantations.The map shows the reality of the mass population of slavery within Virginia.","<br />The southern state's economy depended on slave labor, it continued through the civil war to the thirteenth Amendment in 1865. The eastern part of Virginia, an agriculture-based economy, had the highest percentage of slaves. The mountain area in Western Virginia depended more on an industrial industry, had a fewer population in slaves. Slavery in Virginia was vital to Civil War and Reconstruction era, due to its majority of the slave population."],"display_date":"1861 - 1865","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":53053,"lat":37.1148487,"lng":-78.0195387,"zoom":8,"place":"Nottoway County,Virginia"},{"id":53052,"lat":37.3212714,"lng":-77.973865,"zoom":8,"place":"Virginia, Amelia"}],"tags":[{"id":3313,"tag":"slave population"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2930,"tag":"Virginia"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6691,"title":"Womens Rights During the Civil War","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-01","end_date":"1869-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Since International Women’s Day recently passed, it only seems fitting to analyze the role of women, and how the civil war helped to shape the ideas of the modern-day women.  As in many societies, the women were only viewed as the complementary aid to male, and the only ability of the women was to maintain a household. For centuries, the role of a women has been set out, and most women followed. Although there were exceptions, this is the way life was. During the civil war, starting in 1861, women started to express the urge to be more than the mold that was set out. With this, much criticism followed.","            Although typical roles of women are indeed important, such as raising children, supporting husbands, and maintaining the household, there is so much more to be explored. Many women to possess a more nurturing nature, than some men lack, therefore implying that these are simply women’s roles, but as history will show, women are just as capable as males in many fields. During the civil war, since so many men were away fighting in both the Confederate and Union, women were left to assume the responsibilities of the male that was away. Women had to find a way to provide both financial and emotional support for family, and friends left at home. During this era, women realized, and boldly expressed that they were capable to do the same thing as their male counterparts.","            In a lithograph, <em>“The Age of Brass/ or The Triumphs of Women’s Rights</em>” drawn in 1869 expresses the reactions and criticisms of the progressions of women’s rights. The photo depicts women voting for the “The Celebrated Man.”. Women are shown with exaggerated features that usually are expressed by men such as dresses that resemble suites, women smoking pipes, and the only male in the lithograph is holding a baby, showing confusion, and obviously is in shock of the environment that he is in.","            The depiction of this lithograph shows the negative perception of the progression of women. During the civil war era; it was common belief that if women were given the right to vote, women would attempt to change every facet of society. If women were given the right to assume roles that were predominately influenced by men, their would be no need for the men. While women were expected to stay within their roles, they were still appreciated. Thousands of women aided men in the battlefield of both the confederate and the union side. According to an article by Brooks."," ","            As history, will prove, women will indeed gain rights and will become productive, and influential members of society. While it did take some time, and is continuing to progress, the Civil War played a huge role in the rights of women. "],"display_date":"January 1, 1869 - January 30, 1869","search_date":"1869-01-15","locations":[{"id":52989,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":3,"place":"New York"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6692,"title":"General Robert E.

This was to formally end the Civil War and for General Lee and his army to surrender and go on parole for acts of against the United States. Proceeding towards May 29, 1865 President Andrew Johnson issued a Proclamation of Amnesty and Pardon in the direction of the people of the South who had participated in the Civil War, General Lee was one of these people who submitted an application for a pardon.

One of the most important and influential of these amendments has to be the 13<sup>th</sup> amendment. This amendment states “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” This amendment abolished slavery and set a new tone and new definition of freedom throughout our country. Though in many ways this amendment wasn’t welcomed with open arms, it did project the United States into a new direction. Without the abolishment of slavery we would not be the country we are today and our history would be completely different.","            Throughout the Civil War the beginning goal of the Union was to bring the country back together and leave slavery intact. Once the confederacy proved that they weren’t giving up easily, Abraham Lincoln believed it was time to take action and take away the one thing the Southern States were fighting for. The first glimpse of the abolishment of slavery was with the Emancipation Proclamation. Though this didn’t fix the problem automatically it opened the eyes of many people throughout the country that slavery could in fact be abolished. Many Southerners and even Northerners were angered by this. Though Lincoln stood his actions and he ultimately made the right decision, it didn’t all happen so easily.","            Once the 13<sup>th</sup> Amendment was ratified and the slaves were freed it still was only one step to pure freedom. Though the amendment finally gave the African Americans the citizenship and the basic rights they deserved.  African Americans still had a long road to equality and many believe that struggle continues in modern times. After they were freed they still had to deal with the emergence of the Black Codes, KKK, lynching, and the Jim Crow Laws. These institution ravaged the African American culture for years to come. The south was where most of these institutions blossomed. In the south people were still bitter of the war and many lost their way of income when Slavery was abolished. For many years they would look at the African Americans as inferior and do whatever they could to stop them from becoming or feeling equal."," ","            To conclude, the 13<sup>th</sup> amendment was a pivotal point for the American Society. It brought for new thought of freedom but with that freedom came years of inequality. Abraham Lincoln believed that this country either had to be all slave or all free. Many people disagreed with that point but ultimately it is the reason we are the great country we are. During this time period the definition of true freedom was tested in the United States and I believe it one.

Needing to take on responsibilities that would have otherwise been reserved for adults, many were forced to abandon their childhood and take up roles to aid in the war effort. This included performing clergy work, managing livestock, cooking meals for younger siblings, becoming nurses, sewing fabric to make ends meet, and even enlisting in the army. This hardship however pales in comparison to the difficulties that many African American children had to combat; particularly of those living in the South. Many being viewed as a hindrance to society, in both regions African American children were treated poorly as many refugees migrated from the south to the north to occupy “contraband camps.” Life in these overcrowded camps was filled with great adversity as the children there were exposed to many illnesses all the while needing to attend school, and work in order to be able to provide for themselves. This resulted in many children laboring alongside escaped adult slaves. It was with this new found “freedom” that many children of escaped slaves began to believe in the possibility of a truly better future, but unfortunately this was often times cut short due to the endemic of illnesses that were present throughout the camp that resulted in the deaths of numerous children. With that, children overall played a crucial role in the civil war as once the war began, many became obligated to perform task to aid the war effort both in the domestic field, and at the battle front- though their personal lives were filled with turmoil.","According to Carrie Barry of Atlanta, she did not have a birthday cake for her tenth birthday. As trivial of a fact as this must seem to most individuals, to a young child a birthday celebration is something of great importance. Faced with great hardships, most children found themselves needing to sacrifice immensely in order to maintain their household and the food supply of the soldiers that would frequently demand food from them as they passed by from town to town. In dismay, many children even though they would not even have enough food for themselves, would have to comply with the demands of the soldiers. Knowing that the army could arrive at any moment's notice, children familiarized themselves with food and housing insecurities. Many of them eventually began to starve and in a desperate attempt to save their families, began to organize themselves and perform well-coordinated looting bands. Feeling justified in their actions as most children felt resentful of the war, one young Richmond girl wrote in her journal: “We are starving. As soon as enough of us get together we are going to take the bakeries and each of us will take a loaf of bread. That is little enough for the government to give us after it has taken all our men.” With that having been said, it demonstrates just how independent, and painfully mature most children had to become during the war. Understanding that the suffering exhibited by them was not of their own doing but rather the  result of the actions of others in which they had no say in, the young girl from Richmond portrayed a child who is very aware of reality. This awareness, and bold courage to so bluntly state that they will loot, also is noteworthy in the sense that most young girls in this era were still expected to admire to strict set notions of femininity. This goes to say that in war, all societal norms are broken.","While most children stayed at home, there was a considerable portion of them that decided to engage in formal combat. With approximately 100,000 children enlisting, the army often times turned a blind eye to an obviously underaged child as the number of casualties grew on both sides of the war. It was this demand for soldiers that resulted in twenty percent of the individuals  enlisted to be under the age of eighteen.  Needing drummer boys, nurses, messengers, and scouts many of the children enlisted with these occupations in the army, but during times of necessities, numerous were forced to fight bloody battles alongside their peers, fathers, brothers, and even sisters and mothers. While unfortunately most were not competent in the battlefield due to lack of experience and physical development, there were a few that demonstrated immense courage and competency. One such soldier is Johnny Clem, who was eleven years old at the time of his service. Serving in the battle of Chickamauga, he was captured by a confederate general who, once telling him to surrender, took hold of an assault rifle and shot the general. He was later awarded a silver medal and promoted to sergeant once he was older. Another instance of bravery can be seen by observing the records of John Cook, who was fifteen at the time he dropped his instrument in the middle of battle to operate a canon at the battle of Antietam. This bravery was exhibited by children of all ages; in one instance a child by the name of Edward Black who was eight years of age, severed in the army.","Children throughout the American Civil War had difficulty adapting to life as many were subjected to horrendous living conditions, and mature responsibilities. Whether it be on the home front or battlefield, young children from all socioeconomic and racial backgrounds struggled alike. Needing to find creative ways to find food, several children broke societal norms and robbed and looted for food as well as sewed clothes for money. With all of this, their adversities were not lost as their resourcefulness and willingness to take on adult responsibilities, such as working in factories, managing fields, sowing, being scouts, messengers, drummers, nurses, and child caretakers, without the help of children the war would have been even more brutal for all; their assistance was pertinent for the success of the nation."," "],"display_date":"1863 - 1865","search_date":"1864-07-01","locations":[{"id":52839,"lat":43.6493751,"lng":-80.4707027,"zoom":8,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6698,"title":"Does Emancipation Really Mean Free?","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1865-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     During the time Surrounding the Civil War, African American slaves and northern citizens had anticipated the official end of slavery. Initially during this time there was only one man who had the authority to end the existence of the gruesome institution once and for all. The man in question was Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln was elected President of the U.S in 1861. Being that he was the elected official, he bestowed the power to do something that slaves and citizens of the North had long waited to happen. He emancipated slavery once and for all just two years after being elected. Although he didn’t take charge immediately to end the existence of the gruesome institution, he did it just at the right time during the war."," ","    During the war Lincoln issued a Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. This document was issued by Lincoln in 1862, which was almost a year from the official document. In this document, Lincoln did in fact free slaves. But did he free every slave? Here’s the issue with the preliminary document. Instead of freeing all slaves, he only freed slaves in slave holding Union states. Being that slaves in the union would be emancipated, this would mean that slaves in confederate states would have to wait much longer than they had anticipated. This act also created questions like “ Why not free every slave ?”. There was more to the story leading up to the emancipation of slaves.   "," ","    Being that the country was in an internal war, Lincoln would have to be very clever with the decisions that he made. Because the Confederate Army had possession of part of the country, it was almost impossible for Lincoln to emancipate the slaves in full. The Confederacy definitely wouldn’t allow it. Although Lincoln was the president of the country, the South wasn’t too fond of his ideas and philosophies. The South perceived Lincoln as an imbecile and refused to let him take their source of commerce away from them."," ","Eventually, the Union pushed pass Confederate forces to the point where they had more control. Once they gained as much ground as they did, the war was putty in their hands. After gaining ground into Confederate territory, this opened the door for the emancipation of slaves. In 1863, on the first day of the year, Lincoln finally freed all slaves once and for all. Being that slaves were free, many doors opened up for the African American population. After being freed many of the slaves went on to join the Union Army to give them an edge over the once notorious south. Two years after being emancipated, the slaves joined the Union Army in victory over the Confederacy in 1865. The emancipation of slaves played a vital role in the Civil War. In fact there’s a possibility that the Confederacy may have caused an unexpected turnaround  had slaves  not joined in on the war.

His name was John Breckinridge. This came at a time where the democratic party split. The split came from both democratic runners Breckinridge and Stephen Douglass, the main democratic party holder. Both candidates were for slavery, but Breckinridge was for expanding slavery, while Douglass was for whatever the public felt was needed. This came to a split between southern democrats and northern democrats. Both Breckinridge and Douglass were for keeping the South from seceding, but they were very different on the actual subject of slavery. Slavery was in every nook of this time, which is why most historians will tell you that the whole subject of the Civil War was slavery. It was always the topic of discussion and people back then had strong standings on it, especially those who were actual slave owners.","Breckinridge won southern people because he was for protecting the slave owners and their businesses. Douglass, on the other hand was not so much into protection for the slave owners. This caused the split in the party. When the split happened, Douglass had been nominated for the actual democratic party. This caused an uproar in the South, so Breckenridge technically went third party, but still called himself democrat. This drastically split the democratic vote and gave Lincoln the win in 1860.","After the loss, Breckinridge held a seat in Kentucky legislature. While there, he tried to convince Kentucky officials to secede with the Confederacy. Kentucky ended up joining the Union and Breckenridge fled Kentucky. After leaving, he joined up with the Confederacy and fought through the war and survived. He was an aide to Jefferson Davis. Breckinridge would tell Davis, after signing the official surrender of the Confederacy during the Civil War,  to continue efforts of fighting through guerilla type warfare. He would also push to end the Union even though the fate of the Confederacy had already been decided. He fled to other countries and ended up in Canada where he lived the rest of his life.","The importance of this article is to show how fragile things were during that time period. The Democratic party split because of the rising tensions between the North and the South. Again, neither Breckinridge or Douglass wanted the country to split, but both were clearly for their side. Douglass fought for the North to end the South and their reign. Douglass had to sacrifice his thoughts on slavery for his idea of the greater good. Breckinridge also had to drop his idea of the country not splitting, and fight for what he thought was for the greater good. These stories show that war was a last resort.  War came when there was, obviously, going to be no compromise that the two sides could agree on. The end of the war came when the Confederacy finally handed over their surrender and this time of hell came to an end."," "],"display_date":"1860 - 1865","search_date":"1862-12-31","locations":[{"id":53060,"lat":38.833161,"lng":-77.3081167,"zoom":8,"place":"Broadside, VA"}],"tags":[{"id":3327,"tag":"savagery"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":3213,"tag":"History"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6705,"title":"Failure of Reconstruction","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1877-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","After the Union won the Civil War the Southern economy was left in utter ruin. In an attempt to aid them in their reorganization and integration, the Northern government proceeded to send Union military generals and governors down to the South in order to assist them in reconstruction. However due to their fundamental indifference to Southern prosperity, and lack of concern for growing social tension between the African community, and Caucasians, as their involvement was done more so out of obligation, many of their implementations were done in vain. One such implementation was the establishment of the Freedmen’s Bureau created by Congress. This organization was responsible for providing freedmen with food, medicinal supplies, schooling, and employment opportunities.  While approximately 4,000 children were able to attend schools via the bureau, in regards to their additional goals at aiding freedmen, they were not very successful. This was in part due to their desire to primarily focus on the prosperity of the Northern economy which was over seeing their first ever transcontinental railroad. In addition to this disinterest, many Northerns were divided as to how much assistance the South should receive, this was seen well upon looking at Andrew Johnson’s Administration.","Andrew Johnson was a Southern who favored complete integration with haste while many Republicans in his party opposed it; this caused a split within the party. So while the North began to blossom under its continuous industrial boom, the South ruled by a resentful one party political body that despised the North, began establish itself as a society deeply rooted in white supremacy; this was done in an attempt to hold on to their past as an institution founded on the ideology of racial superiority. With this ex-confederate bureaucrats began to terrorize freedmen preventing them from voting, obtaining land, and prospering. One of the most notorious organizations to arise was the Klu Klux Klan, a hate group founded by ex- confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest. In response to this the government did very little to protect its citizens as they showed little to no concern regarding their equality.         ","This indifference can best be  seen by observing several court cases addressing the mistreatment of African Americans; the two most notorious being U.S vs Cruishank, and U.S vs Reese. In Cruikshank, a court annulled three individuals belonging to a white mob that had murdered 300 African Americans stating that they could not be convicted as the 300 individuals killed were not protected under the law. Chief Justice Waite contradicted himself as he stated “'That if two or more persons shall band or conspire together, or go in disguise upon the public highway, or upon the premises of another, with intent to violate any provision of this act, or to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise and enjoyment of any right or privilege granted or secured to him by the constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having exercised the same, such persons shall be held guilty of felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be fined or imprisoned, or both.” Knowing their familiarity with the law, their verdict was undoubtedly racially motivated. In U.S vs. Reese, an African American man was denied the right to vote after having been given an affidavit for not having been able to pay a voting tax on the premise of not having paid the voting tax, which he was denied access to. These instances of discrimination were not particular as they were pervasive throughout the entirety of the South. This was established well by Black Codes, which ensured that while African Americans were de <em>jure free</em>, while <em>de facto</em> they would remain in bondage. An example of the severity of the restrictions could be seen by noticing that in South Carolina, simply organizing oneself in a small assembly without the supervision of a white figure of authority, was enough to deem the community as “vagrants.”"," ","So though America has had an elected African American President, socio-economic disparities and racial tensions between Caucasians and African Americans continue to be present in contemporary American society. This can be seen by the severe income disparity between the two demographics; one in every four individuals of African descent lives in poverty as opposed to one in every ten Caucasians. In addition to this, institutionalized racism and rampant police brutality continue to cause severe distrust of government and law enforcement agencies within African American communities. So what has been the fundamental cause of all of the inequality? While there are multiple factors that have contributed to America’s long-held struggle with race, the main factor that has prevented our society from progressing has been the failure of reconstruction shortly after the emancipation of African Americans after the civil war. With the American Civil War having reunified the Union, and liberated slaves from bondage, the North with their disinterest for the south, caused immense harm by failing to address the discrimination, and de facto slavery present in their society. "],"display_date":"1865 - 1877","search_date":"1871-07-02","locations":[{"id":53061,"lat":43.8975446,"lng":-78.9429329,"zoom":8,"place":"Louisiana, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":1835,"tag":"Andrew Johnson"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6706,"title":"Analysis of The Battle of Gettysburg","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-01","end_date":"1863-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Civil War is arguably one of the most brutal times in American History.

Lee of the Confederacy against the Union general George G. Meade.

Robert E Lee writes in his letter, “You will, however, learn before this reaches you that our success at Gettysburg was not so great as reported--in fact, that we failed to drive the enemy from his position, and that our army withdrew to the Potomac.” ","            This war was a huge loss for the Confederacy, over 50,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in this battle. 28,000 being soldiers of the Confederacy. “Though the great Confederate general would go on to win other victories, the Battle of Gettysburg (combined with Ulysses S. Grant’s victory at Vicksburg, also on July 4) irrevocably turned the tide of the Civil War in the Union’s favor” (Battle of Gettysburg). This battlefield also became the site where Abraham Lincoln gave one of his most notable speeches, the Gettysburg Address. The take away from this battle was that though the Confederacy had momentum the Union was still too strong and had too much man power. This battle pushed the long and grueling war forward and pushed it in favor of the Union."," ","            To conclude, the Battle of Gettysburg was one of the most important and bloodiest battle of the Civil War. This battle sent Lee’s Army back to the South and gave the North the upper hand and the relief it needed. If the Confederacy would have won this war, our country would be completely different today. The effects of the Civil War still can be seen in our society today and will for years to come. Some of the battle tactics of the famous Civil War generals are still examined and analyzed. Many advances in war and how the war was viewed, were brought to picture by the Civil War. Historians still marvel over this time period and the battles that took place, making the Civil War that much more complexing."],"display_date":"July 1, 1863 - July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":53062,"lat":39.8309293,"lng":-77.2310955,"zoom":8,"place":"Gettysburg, PA"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1860,"tag":"Battle of Gettysburg"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6708,"title":"Angelo M.

At the age of eighteen-years-old the Civil War broke out in American and young Angelo Crapsey decided to enlist in the military and fight for the Union Army. Soon after that he participated in battles that would change his short life forever. He fought at Gettysburg and Antietam and came out unharmed from both battles, at the Battle of Cedar Mountain his unit arrived too late to fight so he was assigned to clean up duty on the battle field. During the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862 Angelo Crapsey was taken prison or war (POW). After spending five months in a POW camp, he and others were exchanged during a prisoner exchange and went back to his unit to continue on fighting in the Civil War. His last and biggest battle that he participated in was the Battle of Gettysburg and left the battle unharmed, but after the battle came down with dysentery, a disease that most people did not survive, so doctors brought his father to him to see him one last time or so they thought, he survived dysentery and was discharged from the Union Army and sent home. Having arrived home a changed man Angelo Crapsey was depressed and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but no one truly understood what was happening with him after the war. Doctors suggested that Crapsey be hospitalized in a mental institution, but his family said no and so young Crapsey grew more depressed and had more problems from the war than expected, having attempted to take his life on many tries only to be saved from each attempt. During the war and after war how one treats our soldiers can be a big deal on whether or not the veteran survives after they come home and young Crapsey did not at the age of twenty-one years old after his friends refused to let him go hunting with them, went out on his own and took his own life in the same manner that he saw while in the army during the Civil War. He felt alone and wanted to end the pain he was feeling from everything he had seen and experienced since the war from the battles he fought into his stay as a POW.

To this day, there are southern heritage groups that see the Confederate flag as a symbol of honor and sacrifice. In the late-nineteenth century, such perceptions helped to “revise” history to exclude or at least minimize the centrality of African Americans and slavery as part of the United States’ national story. After President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that every person held as slaves shall be free and received into the armed services of the US, free black men rushed to volunteer for service with the Union forces. Due to shortage of soldiers, recruitment was established to manage black enlistees. Leaders like Frederick Douglass encouraged free black men to volunteer as a way to ensure eventual full citizenship. Even before this declaration, in 1863, about 186,000 African Americans entered the Union while others were forced to fight for the Confederate side. Nearly 40,000 of those men lost their lives, one of whom was Lizzie McCloud’s brother.","Lizzie McCloud was “bred and born in Tennessee.” She was a former slave freed during the Civil War. It was not until the end of the war that she was scared of white folks. According to her, the war was about “freeing niggers.” As soon as the war broke out, her brother, who was a slave, ran away and joined the Union army. Lizzie’s brother was one of those men who volunteered to fight for his freedom. A musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, he fought to earn his God-given right that was taken away by “white folks.”","What the African Americans have done has been lost among the history books. Initial reluctance to enlist Blacks was followed by large-scale recruiting as demands for manpower overcame the force of prejudice. While the books may not remember the African American soldiers’ names or  undermine their role, they all fought to receive the full enjoyment of freedom and citizenship, if not for themselves, certainly for their families who were still in bondage. In order to get rid of the curse that had separated them from their loved ones, they went to end all those times that their people were forced to swallow their pride and live in bondage of the white man. By striking at the heart of the system, they sought to break the chains that had held them for years.","While one hundred years of Jim Crow laws, lynching, disfranchisement, racism and unequal educational resources were to come, the era of white man treating a black man as property, was almost over. Even though, not many historical accounts hold the names of each fallen black soldier or tell their stories, there were many including Lizzie’s brother, who risked their lives for their freedom and for the protection of the country that they called home."],"display_date":"April 12, 1861 - May 9, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-26","locations":[{"id":53066,"lat":35.464834,"lng":-86.607593,"zoom":8,"place":"Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":715,"tag":"Military"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}},{"id":6713,"title":"The Stone Wall","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"4/16/17","end_date":"4/18/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout the Civil War, there were some great commanders in both the Confederate and Union armies. One commander that stood out to me was Thomas Jackson. Jackson graduated from West Point, a U.S Military academy around 1846. Being that he graduated around that time he was able to fight in the Mexican War which lasted from 1846-1848.  After fighting in the Mexican War, he went on to pursue a teaching career. After teaching for a while, the secession of Virginia came about in 1861. After Virginia seceded from the Union, jackson took immediate action to join the Confederate army.","<strong><br /></strong>","After joining the army, the first wave of secession was already in place. The first wave lasted from December of 1860 through February of 1861. During the first wave, seven southern states took action and declared their independence from the Union. Throughout the first wave, Jackson hoped that his home state, Virginia, would remain in the Union. Although his home state seceded, he continued to show his loyalty towards his state rather than the Federal Government. In the army, Jackson originally served as colonel until he was promoted to brigadier general under General Joseph E. Johnston. Being that Jackson taught artillery tactics, he would have no problem leading men on the battlefield.","<strong><br /></strong>","Of course the first battle of the war came, and Jackson was ready to fight. The first battle in the Civil War was the Battle of Bull Run. In this first battle Jackson earns his nickname. His nickname comes about through a Union general. As Jackson rushed his men to close a gap against union attack, a Union general said “Look men, there’s Jackson standing like a stone wall”. After that day Thomas Jackson became known as “Stonewall” Jackson.  Some people might question why someone would just be standing in the middle of a battle. Later on during the Civil War, Jackson was eventually commissioned as a major general.","<strong><br /></strong>","Throughout the Civil War, Jackson led his men through some great victories. But little did he know that the end was near. Jackson’s final battle took place in Chancellorsville, Virginia. In this battle, Jackson went to fight with almost two times less men than the opposing Union Army.  The Union came into the battle with about 130,000 soldiers, and Jackson brought about 60,000 soldiers to the battle. Jackson already knew that he had the lower hand in this battle. Being that he had the lower hand he decided to join forces with Robert E. Lee to help fight towards victory.","<br />Out of that 60,000 soldiers, Jackson took 28,000 and  engaged in diversionary attacks against Hooker’s exposed flank. Jackson’s attack caused extreme casualties to the Union force. Following the attacks, Hooker was eventually forced to withdraw his soldiers. Hooker’s withdrawal meant victory for the Confederate Army.  The attacks by Jackson lasted until sunset. Following the end of the conflict, Jackson took some of his men to the forest to scout for approaching Union forces. Because it was night time, a North Carolina regiment mistook the Confederate Army for Union troops and opened fire. After realising that they weren’t Union soldiers, they ceased fire only to find that they had wounded Jackson. Jackson later died because the wounds were too severe for him to survive. Jackson went on to be known as one of the most notorious leaders during the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 16, 1917 - April 18, 1917","search_date":"1917-04-17","locations":[{"id":53067,"lat":38.3084627,"lng":-77.6344334,"zoom":8,"place":"Chancellorsville, Virginia"},{"id":52766,"lat":37.4315734,"lng":-78.6568942,"zoom":8,"place":"Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2930,"tag":"Virginia"},{"id":2676,"tag":"Stonewall"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":3347,"tag":"1861"},{"id":3348,"tag":"Thomas Jackson"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6724,"title":"600 Confederate prisoners of war suffer on Morris Island","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-08-04","end_date":"1865-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 4, 1864, fifty Confederate prisoners of war were exchanged for fifty Union prisoners in Charleston, South Carolina. News of this exchange quickly spread among the Confederate prisoners held at Fort Delaware, although the more skeptical men pointed out the lack of evidence, and without further information, the discussion quieted. The rumor revived when a Union sergeant told an officer guarding prisoners there had been an exchange, and the federal government was arranging another. On August 17, 1864 a Union officer named Sergeant Murphy called six hundred names, all officers, who the prisoners believed would be the next group exchanged. One prisoner, John Ogden Murray, wrote: “When the M’s were called on the roll I could hardly contain myself; when my name was called I could have shouted for joy; and I really felt sorry that all my comrades were not included in the list, as we thought, for exchange.” When there was no movement from their guards the next day, the prisoners began thinking that the whole thing had been a cruel joke, until finally, at 3 p.m. August 20, 1864, roll was called again and the six hundred ordered to take their belongings and march onto the steamship <em>Crescent City</em> headed for Morris Island, South Carolina. After eighteen days, with only brief turns above deck, the ship arrived off Morris Island early in the morning of September 7, 1864. Unfortunately for the prisoners, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant sent a letter on August 21, 1864, specifically forbidding the exchange of the prisoners now at Morris Island. Prisoner exchanges were officially halted in July 1863, due to Confederate refusal to include black prisoners of war, but some generals continued arranging unofficial exchanges. By 10 a.m. September 7, 1864 the prisoners were informed there was no intention of exchanging them. The general who ordered the prisoners to Morris Island, Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, was retaliating for Union prisoners of war being placed in the parts of Charleston the Union was shelling. The battery on Morris Island was a target of the guns in Charleston, and he hoped the Confederates would be reluctant to fire on their own men. Although none of the prisoners died from the artillery, they were far from comfortable. Murray wrote that rations consisted of “the luxurious diet of four hardtack army crackers, one ounce of fat meat, and half a pint of sandy bean soup (which often tasted like it had been seasoned with soap).” The prisoners had to dig to the water table to get anything to drink. Three prisoners died on Morris Island of starvation-related illnesses. In early October 1864 a yellow fever outbreak in Charleston led the Confederates to remove their prisoners of war from the city, and in response Foster ordered the men, who would eventually be known as the Immortal 600, moved to Fort Pulaski at the mouth of the Savannah River. They stayed there until March 4, 1865, when they returned to Fort Delaware to wait out the end of the war."],"display_date":"August 4, 1864 - March 4, 1865","search_date":"1864-11-17","locations":[{"id":53080,"lat":32.02706,"lng":-80.8904868,"zoom":15,"place":"Fort Pulaski, Georgia"},{"id":53079,"lat":32.7124021,"lng":-79.8940806,"zoom":15,"place":"Morris Island, South Carolina"},{"id":53078,"lat":39.5906951,"lng":-75.5721664,"zoom":13,"place":"Fort Delaware, Delaware"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}},{"id":6749,"title":"Civil War Field Guides: Advances in Medicine in the 1860's","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-12","end_date":"1865-05-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Civil War is often noted as the bloodiest war in American history, due to the many casualties from the war. However, historian Guy Hasegawa states “roughly twice as many soldiers in that conflict died from disease as from combat injuries.” Naïve medical care and sanitary conditions were a major reason that so many soldiers died from disease. In America, in the late 1800’s, medical education was unstandardized and unregulated, and advanced theories on treatment and spread of disease were under developed. The profession of medicine’s lack of regulation caused each doctor and surgeon to have very different knowledge, experience, and preferences on how to treat various diseases. However, during the Civil War there were advances to the standardization of medical analysis and treatments.","The Union attempted to standardize battlefield medicine by hiring two surgeons to create medical supply lists. Many other surgeons later created medical field guides that aided in surgery and wound treatment. The Report of a committee of the associate medical members of the Sanitary Commission: on the subject of amputations is a twelve-page Civil War field guide on what circumstances require and how to perform field amputations. The Union report also briefly outlines post-care instructions, that are pre-germ theory. Many soldiers fell ill because of infection, due to wounds from living conditions or minor combat-related injuries. However, there were many unlucky soldiers whose combat wounds required amputation. The current thoughts on amputation are that it is a very drastic medical intervention and one of the last attempted treatment options. Unfortunately, during many of the early Civil War battles, surgeons performed more amputations than necessary to better understand the surgery. This is one of the reasons that the report was needed, and provided to battlefield surgeons. ","The Report is a Union edition of an amputation field guide. The Confederacy had their own surgery guides, like A Manual of Military Surgery by Samuel Moore, M.D. In many ways, the Confederate military was less advanced than the Union Army, but this manual was highly advanced with 174 illustrations. However, the Union report, with it’s twelve pages of concise requirements of a wound that mandated amputation, and surgical instruction on how to perform amputations on various areas of the body, would prove very helpful in the midst of battle. Often, there were many gravely injured soldiers screaming and demanding treatment at the same time. Surgeons had to weigh the possibility of infection, with the post-injury use of the limb, and possibility of survival of the injury and surgery, while listening to the gut-wrenching cries of the wounded in an unhygienic field hospital.","The historian Schroeder-Lein, states that field hospitals were often in a nearby home, barn, or other structure; however, if no structures were available, a shade tree would be used. Being that no official tent or area would be stocked and ready for battle made the idea of concise field guides much more needed and valued. A military surgeon could be prepared for amputation at a moment’s notice with his field guide in his pocket or with his surgical case. Although unsanitary conditions proved to be very detrimental, this report shows the innovations and advances in understanding in Civil War medicine. "," "],"display_date":"April 12, 1861 - May 9, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-26","locations":[{"id":52781,"lat":42.3600825,"lng":-71.0588801,"zoom":8,"place":"Boston, MA"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":3442,"tag":"Field Guide"},{"id":3443,"tag":"Amputation"},{"id":3444,"tag":"Military Medicine"},{"id":3445,"tag":"Military Surgery"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}},{"id":6769,"title":"The History of the Ambulance-Wagon During the Civil War","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-12","end_date":"1865-05-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between April 12, 1861 to May 9, 1865, the Civil War waged claiming the lives of about 620,000 American. The Civil War conflict was a great tragedy, but if could have been worse if it wasn’t for William A. Hammond the surgeon general at the time. It was thanks to his almost single-handed push of a vehicle designed to get medics to the injured faster, and/or the injured out of combat zones.","Known as the ambulance-wagon in its time, it was the first vehicle of its kind; with the express purpose of transporting care to the wounded. An 1891 diagram detailed the inner workings of this type of ambulance was used as a detailed diagram of the innerworkings of the type of an old-style ambulance. It was used in its time as a reference to how a vehicle meant for treating wounds on a battlefield should be built and stocked. It includes a medicine pannier, Autenreith medicine wagon, hospital tent, Sibley tent, litters, Wheeling or Rosecrans ambulance wagon, Rucker ambulance wagon, Confederate field ambulance wagon, hospital rail cars, hospital ship, and six-mule team with U.S. Army wagon. The reason from then number of different types of elements was due to the number of different types of war zones the ambulance-wagon would be used in, and the vast amount of different types of injuries one would fall victim to during the war. The company who created it was Julius Bien & Co.","The photo the same ambulance described by the lithograph in action, shows medical staff tending to the wounds of soldiers on the battle field. During the Civil War, when medicine hadn’t advanced to the point where ambulances only served a means of stabilization, and transportation to a hospital like they do now; it was the ambulance-wagon, and those who pushed its integration that no doubt saved thousands of lives.   ","Hammond demanded (and got) one ambulance for every 150 soldiers and got two medical supply wagons for each regimental corps. His improved transportation system proved itself, and at the battle of Antietam (September 1862) his stretcher bearers and ambulance-wagons had every one of the Union Army's 9420 wounded soldiers off the battlefield before the day ended. It was a remarkable feat in the early history of ambulances. At first, ambulance at the time was used strictly for combat zone purposes, but was quickly adopted by hospitals soon after. "],"display_date":"April 12, 1861 - May 9, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-26","locations":[{"id":53115,"lat":32.7523476,"lng":-79.8746925,"zoom":7,"place":"Fort Sumter, South Carolina"},{"id":52839,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":7,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3500,"tag":"William A.

Gale participated in the Battle of Franklin and burying the large number of Confederate dead that filled the battlefield. He wrote a letter home to his wife, describing the battle and the Confederate hospital where he visited his wounded comrades. In the Battle of Franklin, the Confederate Army of Tennessee went on the offensive striking the Union army entrenched there. The offensive resulted in 7,000 Confederate casualties, more casualties than McClellan’s Seven Days Battle. The heavy losses as a result of the battle affected the Confederacy for the rest of the war. The McGavock house, better known as Carton plantation, was located at the Confederate’s rear line, serving as the battlefield and army hospital. The house had been secured before the battle as the Confederate Field Hospital, but they did not anticipate the number of causalities that would overwhelm the hospital. Gale recounted, “Every room was filled, every bed had two poor bleeding fellows, every spare space niche and corner under the stairs, in the hall, everywhere…and when the noble old house could hold no more, the yard was appropriated until the wounded and dead filled that.”","Army hospitals during the Civil War did not have the advanced medical knowledge that exists today. They did not properly clean their instruments after each use, resulting in the spread of infection. Two surgeons were staffed at each field hospital, and Carton Plantation was no different. The McGavock children’s bedrooms served as the operating rooms, where blood stains are still evident on its wooden floors. Each corner of the room was designated for the piling of amputated limbs. Over three hundred men were treated for their wounds in the house, but many more were placed in the yard and slave quarters. Of those wounded that filled the house, one hundred and fifty died during the night. Gale described Carrie McGavock’s unwavering care for the soldiers, stating she was “…unawed by horrid wounds, unblanched by ghastly death she walked from room to room, from man to man, her very skirts stained in blood, the incarnation of pity and mercy.” She helped to prepare bandages for the surgeons using everything from her old linen to her undergarments.

This was no ordinary woman. Frances Clayton told her story to Officer Rand, who then recounted it to the <em>Fort Wayne Daily Gazette</em> the next day. In 1861, Clayton enlisted in the Union Army of Missouri under the alias Jack Williams, with her husband. She fought in eighteen battles, serving in both the cavalry and artillery. Her husband died during the Battle of Stones River, but she continued to serve without him. During the same battle that took the life of her husband, she received a bullet wound to her knee. Upon being taken to a hospital, her identity as a female was discovered and she was discharged from the army. Officer Rand described her as a “…course-looking…woman, thirty years of age, chews plug tobacco, is communicative on the subject of her adventures, and would be a tough customer to handle in a fair fight.” Many other newspapers reported her story, in awe of how a woman could disguise herself as a man and fight in battle. Many documents have supported Clayton’s claims of having disguised herself as a male and served in battle, but little is known as to her life after the war.","            According to historian DeAnne Blanton, Clayton’s story is one of the few documented of women disguising themselves as men and serving in the Civil War. Scholars believe hundreds of women disguised themselves as men and enlisted. While it is thought that their presence at battles did not alter any of their outcomes, the fact these women denied the subordination of their gender as passive and existing only within the private realm is significant. According to historian Richard Hall, women soldiers have been recorded as binding their breasts, cutting their hair, and even wearing false facial hair. While recruiters often put enlistees through health examinations, no standard test was conducted and often they did not have to remove their clothing. Many women that enlisted had no prior experience firing a gun, but many soldiers that volunteered also had no prior experience. As Victorian societal standards remained in place during this time, soldiers often slept in their uniform and did not change their undergarments regularly. Many soldiers chose not to use the unsanitary latrines in the army camp. These societal standards opened the door for women to portray themselves as the opposite gender undetected.","            According to Blanton, there are various reasons why women decided to enlist as soldiers on either side of the war.

Mary sent Union General Charles Sandford a letter demanding to be let her enter her house. She wrote, “It never occurred to me Gen'l Sandford that I could be forced to sue for permission to enter my own house and that such an outrage as its military occupation to the exclusion of me and my children could ever have been perpetrated by anyone in the whole extent of this country.” Lee wrote that the Union troops were planning for over a month to seize her home and to take all her valuable property. Mary decided to take many valuables out of the house two days after Arlington was captured, even if she believed that her home would not come under Union control.","Mary Custis Lee inherited 1,100 acres of land that included the Arlington House and surrounding plantation from her father who was related to George Washington. She eventually married Robert E. Lee, and both lived in the Arlington House when they were not travelling for Robert’s army duties. According to historian Robert E. L. deButtsRobert DeButts, Lee’s home fell under military occupation, because of its important position overlooking the nation’s capital. Mary petitioned to the Union Army to give her access to her home in her letter to General Charles Sandford, but her request was denied. While Robert E. Lee was serving the Confederate Army, Mary Custis fled with the rest of her family to Fairfax, Virginia. According to historian Ruth Rose, throughout the duration of the war the Arlington House was used as an army headquarters for the Union Army and the plot of land was used in 1864 as burial grounds for fallen Union troops.","After the Civil War, Mary petitioned again to regain her home, but her request was rejected once more. She believed the Union Army would be generous enough to return the property to her family. However, the Union Army refused to return the house of the most high-profile enemy. Lee’s children sued in 1882, taking the case to the Supreme Court. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled the confiscation of Lee’s home as invalid, and Lee’s family was given an undisclosed amount of money as settlement. When the Civil War began, the rules of conduct for the Union Army were still in their embryonic stages as jurist Franz Lieber wrote out the military codes for the United States. According to historian John Syrett, Lieber’s code allowed the military to occupy property viewed as a military necessity. The First Confiscation Act, passed on August of 1861, legalized the seizure of Confederate property such as land, personal belongings, and slaves. However, when the house was seized in May of 1861, the Confiscation Acts had not been passed, which convinced the Supreme Court that the seizure was legally invalid."],"display_date":"May 30, 1861","search_date":"1861-05-30","locations":[{"id":53189,"lat":38.610630764815,"lng":-76.901920170316,"zoom":5,"place":"Arlington County, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":3661,"tag":"Confiscation"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6857,"title":"\"Stonewall\" Jackson Suggests Noncombatant Roles for Shenandoah Valley Anabaptists","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-03-21","end_date":"1862-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the spring of 1862, Confederate General Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson contended not only with his Federal enemy, but also with the nonresistant peace churches of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley. A letter Jackson wrote in March of 1862 explains that there were three denominations who resisted service in the militia even when compulsory. Although unnamed, they include the Mennonites, Dunkers (Church of the Brethren) and some Quakers. Some defected and attempted to escape to the North, while others hired substitutes. Those that did join militia forces could “be made to fire, but they [could] very easily take bad aim.” For the sake of an effective fighting force, Jackson suggested that the Virginia Governor John Letcher allow the men to be divided up into companies and used in non-combat roles to better serve the Confederacy.","The Anabaptists of the Shenandoah Valley generally practiced strict non-resistance. While these denominations were not pacifist per se, it was not permissible for them to use violence, or even the political means, to address their worldly issues. These sects condemned slavery, but it was not their place to end it or help support it, as in this case. Instead, even when drafted, the Anabaptist soldiers fired in the air to uphold their convictions.","At the time of Jackson’s letter, Union forces had already entered the Shenandoah Valley. Two days later, they tactically defeated Jackson’s own men at Kernville, Virginia. Maintaining forces in this part of Virginia kept critical Federal forces from other, more central fights. According to historian James McPherson, Confederates, including those in the Shenandoah Valley, were becoming weary by early 1862, having fought for nearly one year. Men had little desire to reenlist or voluntarily enlist. Compulsory service began to replace the voluntary system, forcing more men, including Anabaptists, into militias and general armed forces. While there was a general aversion to such compulsory service in the South, the non-resistant denominations were especially opposed to fighting and actively resisted it in various ways.","“Stonewall” Jackson was certainly not bound to peace as the Anabaptists were, but he was a man of strict Presbyterian faith. He understood the power of religious conviction and through this letter sought a better way to humanely deal with what others would view as disloyal soldiers. He made it clear that these men were “faithful laborers” that could be trusted. While they would not use a rifle to defend their Virginian home, they could still serve through non-combatant roles, like teamsters and laborers. This freed better soldiers for combat and partially dealt with the shortages which hampered the Confederacy throughout the war. More importantly, Jackson’s suggestion is the basis for conscientious objector status for nonresistant denominations in the Confederacy. On October 11, 1862, the Confederacy officially exempted some conscientious objectors, baptized members of specified nonresistant sects, from armed service entirely if they could pay a rather large fee. Although insufficient, such exceptions relieved some of the burden felt by the southern peace churches."],"display_date":"March 21, 1862","search_date":"1862-03-21","locations":[{"id":53193,"lat":38.753760758288,"lng":-78.447091118493,"zoom":9,"place":"Mount Jackson, Shenandoah County, Virgin"}],"tags":[{"id":3664,"tag":"Valley Campaign"},{"id":3663,"tag":"Conscientious Objectors"},{"id":3662,"tag":"CSA"},{"id":3615,"tag":"Protestants/Anabaptists"},{"id":1822,"tag":"Stonewall Jackson"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6858,"title":"The German Baptist Brethren Begin Their Own Reconstruction","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-05-22","end_date":"1866-05-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<strong>            </strong>In 1866, delegates from the German Baptist Brethren (Church of the Brethren) gathered for their Annual Meeting to formally address pressing matters of church doctrine. While these ordained men discussed topics ranging from lightning rods to funeral attire, some of their conversation also focused on addressing consequences of the recently concluded Civil War and the role they should play in its wake. The first article of discussion reinforced their traditional aversion to voting after a faction of the delegates brought it into question. Later in the meeting, the elders, despite their lack of specific knowledge, forbade ministers in Missouri from swearing the oath of loyalty for ministers and officials, as found in their new state constitution, “if it conflicts with the principles of the gospel.” Delegates also addressed the fact that “the freedmen of the south [were] in a starving condition, and also destitute of education and Christianity” by raising funds and sending brethren to “distribute those funds among the needy, irrespective of color.” Finally, near the close of the meeting, the ordained men agreed to reimburse a brother who had freed Anabaptists draft-dodgers from prison with his own funds and suffered Confederate thefts during the war.","            The Brethren, like all Americans, had to deal with the consequences of the Civil War. Hunger was wide spread. Education, especially for African Americans, remained almost nonexistent. While Southern Brethren were generally had more resources than freedmen, many suffered serious property damage as well, especially during the Valley Campaigns in Virginia. According to Anabaptist historians James Lehman and Steven Nolt, costs associated with avoiding conscripted service through substitutes, prison bail, relocation and, eventually, a consensus objector fee, also weighed heavily.","On top of material issues, there proved to be continued political discord as the South slowly reintegrated itself into the United States. The Brethren traditionally played little role in politics, especially the politics of war, on grounds of their non-resistant doctrine. Therefore, they generally did not vote nor participate in the creation of Federal Reconstruction. This said, the Brethren were not always supportive of the outcomes. For example, while many Brethren remained loyal to the Union, they disagreed with swearing the required loyalty oaths for ministers, officials and voters.","While the Brethren refused to participate in the politics of Reconstruction, they understood that there were still needs and found their own way to address them. Within their church structures they successfully supplemented federal inadequacies in their own community and in the broader South. They raised thousands of dollars and sent Brethren to feed, educate and minister to communities in need.

General Ripley did so to address gun makers’ proposals to sell their repeating Henry and Spencer “magazine arms” to the Union Army. He went on to describe these rifles and the ammunition that allowed them to fire multiple shots without reloading. While the General noted that reports on the repeaters “are favorable,” he believed their trials were too limited to identify them as effective combat weapons. He also shared his concerns about the weight of the loaded rifles, safety of the self-contained ammunition, and complexity of supplying that ammunition. In his opinion, the breech-loading carbines, which were already ordered by the Army, were good enough. Ripley felt that the repeating rifles should “be stopped by the refusal to introduce any more unless upon the most full and complete evidence of their great superiority.”","             The world in which General Ripley wrote was one of great technological advancement, firearms included. Throughout the Civil War, most soldiers carried single shot, muzzle-loading rifled muskets. While these rifles were certainly an advancement over early smoothbore muskets, they were slow and difficult to reload. Capable soldiers could only fire a few shots per minute. To help remedy this, a number of inventors developed breach-loading carbines, which could be easily loaded from the rear of the barrel. Both Union and Confederate forces adopted numerous versions of this design and implemented them with some success.","Although breech-loaders were an effective technological advancement, the first practical repeating arms entered the market shortly before the outbreak of war. Lever-action type carbines, including the Volcanic, Spencer and Henry, proved to be the most enduring and effective designs. These weapons could be loaded with several rounds of self-contained ammunition in a tubular magazine. Actuating a lever ejected the spent round and reloaded a fresh one from that magazine, readying it for fire. The self-contained ammunition required by the Spencer and Henry rifles used a metallic casing, which conveniently held the bullet, gunpowder and the primer, mercury fulminate. Altogether, this system yielded a much higher rate of fire.","            Despite General Ripley’s letter discrediting the new repeating arms, they did see some official service in the Civil War. A number of Union units were equipped with Spencer carbines by 1863. A few units also adopted the superior Henrys, although more soldiers privately purchased them. Mounted cavalry especially coveted the repeaters. They proved to be quite effective in battle, allowing small numbers of soldiers to produce huge volumes of fire, even in adverse situations. Expended use of these repeating carbines, despite concerns, likely would have helped the Union achieve victory in the Civil War sooner. Yet, most army brass continued to follow Ripley’s overly cautious thought process. Even decades after the war, single shot trapdoor rifles remained standard issue. While civilians and foreign governments welcomed the repeating arms, the U.S. Army did not adopt one as its standard issue rifle until 1892."],"display_date":"December 9, 1861","search_date":"1861-12-09","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.920310953731,"lng":-436.99169966104,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3665,"tag":"Rifles"},{"id":2289,"tag":"Weapons"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6870,"title":"Union Navy seeks enlistees from New Bern, North Carolina","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-02","end_date":"1863-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A year after New Bern fell to the Union, the Navy sought recruits among the inhabitants. Recruitment applied to able-bodied men from New Bern that were not in the Union Army. Naval recruitment in New Bern was overseen by the commander of the <em>USS Hetzel</em>, H. K. Davenport, who partook in the liberation of New Bern on March 14, 1862. Davenport’s recruitment posters stated, “All able-bodied men not in the employment of the Army, will be enlisted into the Navy upon application at the Naval Rendezvous, on Craven Street, next door to the Printing Office.”","H. K. Davenport was the first commanding officer of the <em>USS Hetzel</em>, a Union steamer built in 1861. The <em>USS Hetzel</em> primarily engaged Confederate ships, such as the <em>Patrick Henry</em>, along North Carolina’s coast, and scored many successes. The <em>Hetzel</em> also landed Union Army troops onto North Carolina’s coast to help capture New Bern, a small port city. Afterward, she remained along the coast of North Carolina to protect the coastal city up until November 1864. The steamer’s placement along New Bern helped to repel a Confederate attack on Fort Anderson on March 13-14, 1863. Not only was the <em>Hetzel’s</em> crew influential with the defense of New Bern after 1862, but its crew recruited locals into the Union Navy.","After New Bern’s capture many local North Carolinians deserted the Confederate Army and switched their allegiance to the Union Army and Navy. Many of the recruits ended up with the same objective of protecting New Bern, but this time for the opposite side. The events at New Bern showed that Union forces trusted and took in former enemies as comrades. It became tactically smart for the Union Army to recruit locals who were familiar with their own city and had experience in defending New Bern in 1862. Confederate forces made multiple attempts to recapture New Bern from Union troops. According to historian Judkin Browning, however, after the Confederates captured a Union outpost at New Bern on February 1864, they executed twenty-two former Confederate soldiers who were recruited into the Union Army.

On July 1, 1863, Reynolds’ men, part of the Army of the Potomac, had the intentions of relieving General John Buford’s cavalry who had formed defensive lines around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. As Reynolds and his troops traveled through a heavily wooded area on the outskirts of Gettysburg, Orderly Sergeant R. B. Clevenger observed that an enemy sharpshooter fired a Minnié ball straight into the back of his neck, which then passed through his brain. Reynolds died instantly. His horse launched him into a cluster of trees that left a marking on the bark. Of all the individuals who lost their lives in the Battle of Gettysburg, Reynolds held the highest rank and some estimated, the greatest potential. Reynolds commanded three corps: his own First Corps, Sickles’ Third, and Howard’s Eleventh. The Army of the Potomac unequivocally lost a great officer.","General John Buford, Jr. warned Reynolds not to ride into the grove of trees. Buford expressed that this exposure would make him an easy target. According to one of Reynolds’ soldiers, Major Joseph G. Rosengarten, Reynolds had given orders to “thrust forward his forces and push the enemy, almost inviting and compelling their return.”  Reynolds’ choice to take this particular route obviously led to his death. However, Reynolds’ choices during the time leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg also contributed to his death. After President Lincoln relieved General Joseph Hooker as commander of the Army of the Potomac, Reynolds had the offer to assume his position. However, he declined it and suggested the promotion of General George Meade. In making the decision to reject President Lincoln’s offer, Reynolds assumed a position that put him in more danger. Major Rosengarten argued, “His modest preference of Meade as the chief of the Army of the Potomac, when Hooker was relieved, no doubt brought Reynolds to the spot where he found his death.” The tragic irony of Reynolds’ death illustrates historical contingency, for no one knows what would have happened if Reynolds did take this position.","Among the numerous casualties at the Battle of Gettysburg, Rosengarten believed that Reynolds would forever stand out. General T. F. M’Coy, who also served under Reynolds, recalled his own shock when he learned of Reynold’s death. Likewise, Reynold’s corps greatly mourned his loss along with the entire Army of the Potomac. However, this tragedy did not negatively affect the performance of his corps. In fact, his death motivated them to carry out his plans fully and efficiently. Rosengarten stated, “[Reynold’s death] led to no disorder, changed no disposition he had directed, and in itself made the men only more eager to carry out his orders.” The significance of his death shows just how much of an impact he had on his men. Many individuals believed the first day would have gone better if Reynolds had lived. The Army of the Potomac undoubtedly lost one of their best leaders, and perhaps the outcome of the entire Battle of Gettysburg would have changed if he made it through the first day."],"display_date":"July 1, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-01","locations":[{"id":53027,"lat":39.831284450011,"lng":-77.230555239029,"zoom":15,"place":"Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1860,"tag":"Battle of Gettysburg"},{"id":3247,"tag":"Army of The Potomac"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6873,"title":"E.

As the commander of Confederate artillery, Alexander led a bombardment with 140 guns. When describing it, Alexander wrote, “The enemy’s position seemed to have broken out with guns everywhere, and from Round Top to Cemetery Hill was blazing like a volcano. The air seemed full of missiles from every direction.” Unfortunately, the Confederates aimed a little too high which resulted in minimal casualties to the Union lines. When the opportunity seemed to present itself, the advance began. Pickett’s division marched over an open field that stretched nearly a mile in length. The charge began with 14,000 men and ended with less than half. Alexander observed, “It seemed as if 100,000 men were engaged, and that human life was being poured out like water.” This assault collapsed due to the Union pressure to its front and flanks. Only two or three hundred men made it through the Union line. The charge failed miserably and forced the Army of Northern Virginia to break off the battle and retreat south of the Potomac.","After taking his position at twelve o’clock, Alexander received a note from General Longstreet telling him to use his best judgment. It said, “If the artillery fire does not have the effect to drive off the enemy or greatly demoralize him…I would prefer that you should not advise General Pickett to make the charge.” This note greatly startled Alexander for he did not want this kind of pressure on his shoulders. After a few note exchanges with Longstreet, Alexander wrote, “General: When our artillery fire is at its best, I shall order Pickett to charge.” At exactly one o’clock, he ordered the artillery to fire. He had already made up his mind to tell Pickett to advance within fifteen to twenty minutes after the cannonade opened.","Historian James McPherson stated that “Pickett’s charge represented the Confederate war effort in microcosm: Matchless valor, apparent initial success, and ultimate disaster.” Preceding the actual charge, General Lee ordered a Confederate cannonade to weaken the Union lines. For a quick moment, the Union ceased fire, and Alexander sent a note ordering Pickett to quickly advance. Pickett took this note to Longstreet who said nothing, unwilling to approve of this command. Pickett decided to move forward and immediately put it into motion. Longstreet knew that this charge would end disastrously, and he even ordered Alexander to stop Pickett and replenish his ammunition. Alexander did not want to call off the charge. He believed, “The battle was lost if we stopped…There was a chance, and it was not my part to interfere.” Considering the outcome of Pickett’s Charge, failure may have resulted either way. Unfortunately, Pickett’s division advanced before anyone had the opportunity to stop him, and he ultimately led over 7,000 soldiers to their death.  Many historians blame Lee for this failure, but E. P. Alexander played a role in this charge through his poorly aimed bombardment."," "],"display_date":"July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-03","locations":[{"id":53203,"lat":39.824781492115,"lng":-77.230518915765,"zoom":13,"place":"Adams County, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1860,"tag":"Battle of Gettysburg"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6877,"title":"A New Soldier Writes Home From Virginia","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-08-24","end_date":"1862-08-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On August 24, 1862, a soldier from the 125<sup>th </sup>Pennsylvania regiment wrote home from Camp Welles, Virginia, where the regiment had recently arrived.  His letter was published in the <em>Huntingdon </em><em>Globe </em>on Wednesday, September 3, 1862.   He described his trip from Pennsylvania, before providing an updated list of promotions within the regiment, along with his thoughts on the war, and on life in camp. The author’s identity is not clear, as his letter is signed only with his initials; “A.T.”.  The 125<sup>th</sup>regiment had left Harrisburg, PA, on August 16, 1862.  They arrived in Washington, D.C. the next day, and crossed the Potomac on August 18. They “advanced about 4 miles into Virginia” and were still encamped there at the time of the author’s writing.  "," A.T. seems largely unimpressed with the journey to Virginia.  According to the author, the land surrounding his route through Maryland appeared as though “the people of Maryland had always paid more attention to treason to the government than to agricultural pursuits.”  He was similarly disappointed by the appearance of Washington, D.C., although he considered the Capitol building to be the “grandest and most magnificent structure on the continent.”  A.T. considered the small portion of Virginia that he had observed to be a “vast waste.”  It had been inhabited by troops for some time, first by Confederate forces and then by the Union."," Despite this, A.T.’s tone remained cheerful and patriotic.  He described the troops as being in generally “good spirits.”  Like many new troops, he expressed a highly patriotic viewpoint, and urged readers of the <em>Globe</em>to give the war effort their unwavering support.  ","            A.T. had little to say of life in camp, other than that some men had already been affected by illness, including bad colds and a few cases of diarrhea.  This was typical for fresh troops, who were often affected by disease.  Soldiers from rural areas, such as Huntingdon and Blair counties, were particularly susceptible to contagious disease. Dysentery was responsible for a large percentage of total deaths throughout the war.  According the historian James McPherson, disease often halved the size of a regiment before any exposure to combat.  "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"August 24, 1862","search_date":"1862-08-24","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":43.017211200706,"lng":-92.72115625,"zoom":3,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3684,"tag":"camp life"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":122,"tag":"Soldier"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6882,"title":"Blood Fighting Blood: An example of two brothers in the Civil War","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-06-16","end_date":"1862-06-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On the June 18, 1862, two days following the Battle of Secessionville, a young Union color bearer named Alexander “Sandy” Campbell received a letter from his brother James.

The Union troops assaulted the Confederate fort near Secessionville, but the fort was heavily defended and soon augmented with reinforcements.
