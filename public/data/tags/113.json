Tennessee</em> which was an ironclad.","Admiral Farragut formed his fleet into a line that was two ships wide led by the <em>U.S.S.

According to Bulloch in his book <em>The Secret Service of the Confederate States in Europe Volume 1</em>, “My early operations were greatly helped by the generous confidence of Messrs. Fraser, Trenholm and Co.  Within a month after my arrival, I had not only been able to buy a fair quantity of naval supplies on their credit, but had laid the keel of the first foreign built Confederate cruiser.”","The ship was to be built by two separate companies.  The first was William C. Miller and Sons who were responsible for the building of the ship and its frame, and the second was a company called Fawcett, Preston and Co. who was responsible for the manufacturing of the engine.  In his book, Bulloch says about William C. Miller and Sons, “The firm was selected…because the senior of the firm had been in the Royal Navy as a shipwright, and had served in her Majesty’s dockyards as a naval constructor.”  Moreover, Fawcett, Preston and Co. was also conveniently located in Liverpool which made the secrecy of the operation that much easier.","Construction of the ship commenced and it was made known that the ship’s name was <em>Oreto</em>, and that it was being built for an Italian merchant fleet.  This was necessary because the U.S. Consul in Liverpool at the time, Thomas Dudley, was watchful for Confederate war ships and tried to put an end to it by means of British neutrality laws.  Unfortunately, Dudley was unsuccessful because of Bulloch’s immense knowledge for these laws.  Bulloch made sure that the ship was never armed while being built so therefore, under law its manufacture was never in violation of the neutrality acts.","The <em>CSS Florida </em>sailed out of port in Liverpool destined to become a distinguished vessel for the navy of the confederacy, and Bulloch a silent hero."],"display_date":"June 4, 1861 - August 17, 1862","search_date":"1862-01-09","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":1579,"tag":"Undercover"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":6637,"title":"Raised from the Locker","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"5/3/95","end_date":"4/17/04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","            On the Seventeenth of February, 1864, a Confederate States submarine, known as the <em>CSS Hunley</em>, made its first attack on the Union blockade ships. The <em>USS Housatonic</em> sank to the bottom of the sea, a victim to the first successful submarine attack. However, she would not sink alone. <em>The Hunley</em> did not return to shore to bask in the glory of her achievement. She and her crew of eight would be lost to the waves for over a hundred years. The Hunley had sunken to the deep thrice in her lifetime, killing her crews each time. One of these would include the principle designer and creator, Horace Lawson Hunley. However, this was not the end to the Hunley’s tale. Stories would be told of the famed submarine that would then reach the ears of author, adventure seeker, and founder of the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) Clive Cussler. Cussler is a man with a mind that functions, in his own words as written in July 1980, “left of delirium and right of monomania.” To Cussler, there was no greater thrill than that of the ocean’s discovery. His first attempt at finding the lost ship would be away from the site of the <em>USS Housatonic</em>’s wreckage as he had reports by the deck officers of the vessel that the Hunley had backed away some 50-100 feet before the explosion. His first search in 1980 would yield no results."," ","            Cussler’s third expedition, from June 1994 to May 1995, would prove different. Armed with new hands, new technology, and a determination bordering obsession; the NUMA diving crew of Ralph Wilbanks, Wes Hall, and Harry Pecorelli would locate the sunken submarine a thousand feet southeast from the <em>Housatonic</em>’s boiler. When they resurfaced, they were instructed by Cussler to photograph their dig for authentication. On the first of May, 1995, the <em>Hunley</em> had been found."," ","            Finding the ship, though a challenge, was the easy part. The real question was how to move a multi-ton, rusting, and fragile piece of history from the bottom of the ocean back to the surface. This task fell to the NUMA group using technology from Oceaneering International Inc. Cussler donated $50,000 to the effort, but the ocean refused to make it easy. Structural integrity was weak, the possibility of looting was real, visibility for divers was a hassle, and the recovery crew had to deal with the possibility of weather setbacks. New strategies were needed. By this point, a basic procedure had been formed: dive, prep, install suction piles, set up recovery frame, set up a sling under the hull, load cells to support the system, foam protection for the <em>Hunley</em> against the system, recover the wreckage. As one could imagine, this was a long and drawn out process. One could not be too careful with the history below the waves. Five years after the discovery of the historic vessel, the <em>Hunley</em> finally returned to Charleston, South Carolina after over a century missing at sea and her crew was given a proper burial on April 17, 2004."],"display_date":"May 3, 1995 - April 17, 1904","search_date":"1949-10-24","locations":[{"id":53010,"lat":32.7764749,"lng":-79.9310512,"zoom":8,"place":"Charlestown, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3230,"tag":"Public History"},{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6685,"title":"Union Navy Battles and Advancements of the Civil War","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-07","end_date":"1865-01-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The actions exhibited by the Northern Navy were very commendable as they aided the Union in victory. With in-land battles being crucial in determining the victor, often Navy triumph’s would transpire to in-land achievements as sea, and river battles would aid soldiers in combat. That understood importance resulted in the  Union expanding the Navy  by approximately six hundred percent. Out of this, bold strategy, technological innovation, and bravery was demonstrated by Union marines, and sailors. This can be seen as in just one battle, the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, fiftyone sailors and marine earned the Medal of Honor; one of the highest awards a serviceman can receive. With this the American Civil War proved to be paramount in the development of our contemporary Navy. Having had great feats accomplished by the expansion, the Civil War presented the Navy with many first accomplishments in battle and technological advancements.","Civil War Navy battles depicted many acts of savvy military strategy that fathered great Union successes. In one Battle, the Battle of Port Royal that took place November 7th, 1861, disastrous weather compelled Union leaders to terminate an inland operation in South Carolina and instead attack Port Royal Sound. This ultimately was a desirable action as Union ingenuity, along with their intense determination earned them a  successful campaign. Lasting four and a half hours, the Union victory resulted in them being able to take full control of the Port. This gave the North access to the Charleston harbour; which enabled them to fortify the blockade on a crucial sea port (Trust). Another significant battle was that of Forts Henry and Donelson which occurred February 16, 1862. In this Navy battle Union Leader Andrew H. Foote, working alongside famed Ulysses S. Grant, led a flotilla (a fleet of ships) out of Illinois in order to operate an attack on Fort Henry; which resulted in the Tennessee River opening up to the North. This action as well as that of  instantaneously  pivoting to the East to conquer Fort Donelson on the Cumberland river led to Union victory. With that, the fall of the port then fell onto the control of the Union as it eventually forced Nashville to surrender; the first capital to fall to the Union (Trust). With all of that, it should be noted that with the Second Battle of Fort Fisher taking place January 13-15, 1865, the Union victory allowed confederate commerce via the seaside to be terminated entirely throughout the remaining portion of the war.","The Civil War was when Americans first used Ironclad ships in battle. This revolutionized Naval warfare as it then permitted ships to gain speed, and hold larger guns, changing the atmosphere of war significantly. It was at this time period that torpedoes were also introduced to Naval warfare, as well as the use of submarine to gain the element of a surprise attack and intel (Mil). This rapid increase of technology within a relatively short period of time is indicative to how imperative most individuals believed technological innovation and advancement was, as well as the production of competent ships and boats. This can be seen as in 1853 America had but only eighteen ships, but after the eruption of the Civil war developed ninety ships. One of the most memorable ironclad ships was Monitor; led by Union forces in a heated battle against the Merrimac. As these type of ships were previously unknown, their impact was impressive.","On September 5th, Thursday, John G Morrison stated in his diary that he was “ turned in last night like a trooper’s horse, ready to bounce,” and that he was “not disturbed” by the action of entering battle. This kind of bravery and selflessness is not an isolated case within one soldier as many Union and Confederate men exhibited immense amount of bravery before entering battle (Morrison). So even though many a times, it was dark and or cold, many were still able to perform their duties knowing that it is what was needed of them.","Though overall Naval victories were not as imperative as in-land victories, winning the war on water was an essential aspect of the American Civil War. It aided the Union into victory as with the sea and river campaigns, it permitted them to take over crucial ports and fortify blockages that cut of Southern sea commerce, and potential aid foreign states. As well as this, throughout the American Civil War many technological advancements and innovations were made; the first ironclads were made, submarines were used in warfare, and torpedoes were introduced.","<strong><br /></strong>"," "],"display_date":"November 7, 1861 - January 15, 1865","search_date":"1863-06-12","locations":[{"id":53046,"lat":43.9508633,"lng":-79.7641511,"zoom":8,"place":"Tennessee, USA"},{"id":53047,"lat":43.9079666,"lng":-78.4576144,"zoom":8,"place":"Illinois, USA"},{"id":53048,"lat":43.9138071,"lng":-78.6287105,"zoom":8,"place":"Fort Henry, USA"},{"id":53049,"lat":43.9900275,"lng":-77.7131275,"zoom":8,"place":"Fort Fisher, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":2966,"tag":"American Civil War"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":3308,"tag":"Battle tactics"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6870,"title":"Union Navy seeks enlistees from New Bern, North Carolina","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-02","end_date":"1863-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A year after New Bern fell to the Union, the Navy sought recruits among the inhabitants. Recruitment applied to able-bodied men from New Bern that were not in the Union Army. Naval recruitment in New Bern was overseen by the commander of the <em>USS Hetzel</em>, H. K. Davenport, who partook in the liberation of New Bern on March 14, 1862. Davenport’s recruitment posters stated, “All able-bodied men not in the employment of the Army, will be enlisted into the Navy upon application at the Naval Rendezvous, on Craven Street, next door to the Printing Office.”","H. K. Davenport was the first commanding officer of the <em>USS Hetzel</em>, a Union steamer built in 1861. The <em>USS Hetzel</em> primarily engaged Confederate ships, such as the <em>Patrick Henry</em>, along North Carolina’s coast, and scored many successes. The <em>Hetzel</em> also landed Union Army troops onto North Carolina’s coast to help capture New Bern, a small port city. Afterward, she remained along the coast of North Carolina to protect the coastal city up until November 1864. The steamer’s placement along New Bern helped to repel a Confederate attack on Fort Anderson on March 13-14, 1863. Not only was the <em>Hetzel’s</em> crew influential with the defense of New Bern after 1862, but its crew recruited locals into the Union Navy.","After New Bern’s capture many local North Carolinians deserted the Confederate Army and switched their allegiance to the Union Army and Navy. Many of the recruits ended up with the same objective of protecting New Bern, but this time for the opposite side. The events at New Bern showed that Union forces trusted and took in former enemies as comrades. It became tactically smart for the Union Army to recruit locals who were familiar with their own city and had experience in defending New Bern in 1862. Confederate forces made multiple attempts to recapture New Bern from Union troops. According to historian Judkin Browning, however, after the Confederates captured a Union outpost at New Bern on February 1864, they executed twenty-two former Confederate soldiers who were recruited into the Union Army. Throughout the Civil War, captured soldiers would be paroled and taken off the battlefield, but in New Bern’s case traitors would have to pay with their lives."],"display_date":"November 2, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-02","locations":[{"id":53201,"lat":35.0877672,"lng":-77.0564464,"zoom":5,"place":"Craven County, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
