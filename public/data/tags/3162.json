Johnson and the Civil Rights Act of 1964","course_id":163,"status":"P","start_date":"5/2/63","end_date":"7/2/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At the White House signing ceremony for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared, “Let us close the springs of racial poison.”","Although President John F. Kennedy had promised in his 1960 campaign to introduce civil rights legislation, by the spring of 1963 he had still taken no action.  On May 2, 1963, the push for civil rights burst into living rooms across the nation via television. Young African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama publicly, peacefully, protested against racial discrimination and segregation. For eight days, Birmingham authorities, led by the Public Safety Director, Eugene “Bull” Connor, responded to the protest by attacking the youngsters with police dogs and fire hoses. The public was horrified at the sight of the police officers brutally beating children, people knocked off their feet by the spray of high-pressure fire hoses, and police dogs biting young protestors.","On the evening of June 11, Kennedy made a nationally televised address in which he made his case for civil rights legislation that would end legalized racial discrimination and segregation. On that same evening, segregationist Byron De La Beckwith gunned down the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Mississippi Field Director Medgar Evers in the driveway of his Jackson, Mississippi home.","After the Civil War, a two-tiered society emerged in the South. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Plessy <em>vs.</em> Ferguson (1896)—which legalized racial discrimination and segregation under the “separate but equal” doctrine (also known as Jim Crow)—encouraged the recalcitrant Southerners. The Plessy decision forced African Americans to live under Jim Crow until a few young lawyers from the NAACP finally broke the foundation of the Plessy decision. In May 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the NAACP and their clients in Brown <em>vs.</em> Board of Education, which ended the separate but equal doctrine—after 58 years.","Between 1954 and 1964, numerous violent clashes occurred leaving many dead before Johnson signed the Act into law. Johnson, a southerner himself, was <em>not</em> an early supporter of new civil rights legislation. After Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963, Johnson reluctantly picked up the mantle of civil rights, eventually making the cause his own, after he rammed the bill through Congress. Johnson told several of his aides that “by pushing the Civil Rights Bill through Congress, I have delivered the South to the Republicans.”","Deeply troubled about his election possibilities, Johnson continued his campaign for the presidency. He defeated Republican Senator Barry Goldwater, who voted <em>against</em> the Act, in a landslide victory. However, that victory cost the Democratic Party. Many southerners (office holders and voters) switched their party affiliation to Republican, realigning the parties geographically, philosophically, and politically."," "],"display_date":"May 2, 1963 - July 2, 1964","search_date":"1963-12-01","locations":[{"id":52985,"lat":32.2987573,"lng":-90.1848103,"zoom":8,"place":"Jackson, MS"},{"id":52984,"lat":33.5206608,"lng":-86.80249,"zoom":8,"place":"Birmingham, AL"},{"id":52836,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3236,"tag":"Brown vs. Board"},{"id":472,"tag":"Plessy vs. Ferguson"},{"id":3163,"tag":"Civil Rights Act of 1964"},{"id":3162,"tag":"Lyndon B.

New York Times reporter Wallace Turner wrote, “The other surviving brother in the family, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has told his friends that he doubts seriously if Robert Kennedy knows what he wants to do.” The press interest in Kennedy may not have been as organic as it appeared. Turner served as a Press Secretary in the Kennedy Administration. Despite Kennedy being the popular favorite among Democrats for the Vice Presidency, Johnson detested the idea of choosing a Kennedy as his running mate in an effort to forge his own legacy. ","Following the assassination of his brother, the once confident Robert F. Kennedy suddenly felt unsure of himself in Washington. RFK served as John F. Kennedy’s most trusted advisor in addition to being the Attorney General.  Although RFK remained the Attorney General for several months under Lyndon B. Johnson, RFK lacked the purpose and drive he displayed while serving his brother. RFK fell into a deep depression immediately after his brother’s death and did not report to work for weeks according to On His Own: Robert Kennedy, 1964-1968, by William Vanden Heuvel. ","Under immense internal and external pressure, Robert Kennedy weighed his options for the next chapter of his life. Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in September 1964, the press widely speculated on where RFK would end up. Vanden Heuvel, a close associate of RFK, named some of the positions RFK considered pursuing following his departure from the Johnson Administration. The positions included several ambassadorships, Governor of Massachusetts, and New York State Senator. Taking over JFK’s legacy required RFK to run for office for the first time in his life. Lacking his late brother’s charisma, RFK benefited from immense carryover support from his brother in the Democratic Party. ","RFK’s popularity in the Democratic party made him a de facto candidate for Vice President to the incumbent Johnson in the 1964 election. RFK coveted the Vice Presidency because it would give him the greatest ability to fulfil JFK’s policy goals. RFK admired the Johnson administration’s continuation of many of the New Frontier programs and legislation introduced by JFK. Much to the delight of Johnson, the same polls of the Democratic Party that showed the steadfast support for RFK also revealed that Johnson would not need RFK in order to beat Republican Barry Goldwater. ","After Johnson passed over RFK for the Vice Presidency, RFK moved north to run for a senate seat in New York. Kennedy would remain a NY Senator until his death during his campaign for the presidency in 1968. Despite not being named a the Vice Presidential candidate, RFK was able to continue JFK’s legacy of the New Frontier in the senate and later on the campaign trail before his own assassination."],"display_date":"April 26, 1964","search_date":"1964-04-26","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":12,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3070,"tag":"Robert F.
