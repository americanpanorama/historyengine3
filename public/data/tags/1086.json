Roosevelt instituted the New Deal for Americans.  Unfortunately, it was allocated inconsistently by local officials and resulted in the underrepresentation of Mexican-Americans.  Zaragosa Vargas, a Mexican-American historian, notes that since they held no political influence, like African-Americans, they received less benefits than whites under programs such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act,  the National Recovery Administration, the Workers Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps.","According to Vargas, San Antonio’s Westside held almost two-thirds of the Mexican-American’s total population estimated to be one hundred thousand.  The Westside slum was a breeding ground for tuberculosis, diphtheria and other communicable diseases.  It became a place of “considerable human suffering” with no alleviation in sight.","Yet, in 1932, living amidst the terrible suffering in San Antonio’s slums, Emma Tenayuca became actively involved in bringing an end to disenfranchisement, poverty and the oppression of the Mexican-American people.  In 1933, she participated and was arrested in the strike against the Finck Cigar Company.  Undaunted, she assisted and organized the garment worker’s strike against the Dorothy Frock’s Company a year later.  Her unrelenting determination led her to take important positions as leader of the Unemployed Council in 1935.  More notably, Tenyauca was recognized in 1937, when “she was elected to the National executive Committee of the Worker’s Alliance of America” as the first Mexican-American woman to ever hold that office in any national organization.","Determined, Emma Tenayuca continued to organize the Mexican-American people, hold “street meetings, [organize] mass demonstrations, [picket] relief offices, and [petition] relief offices to raise WPA work relief pay of Tejanos equal to that of Anglos.”  Vargas believed that “her fiery eloquence attracted large crowds to the open-air meetings” and made her the most successful public speaker of the time.  Due primarily to her efforts, San Antonio’s River Walk provided work under the WPA for Mexican-American workers, as they created the pedestrian walkway and diverted the San Antonio River through the middle of the city.","Although only a young woman, Emma Tenayuca was very aware of the living conditions, misery and poverty of San Antonio’s Mexican-American people.  Fearing more the effects of oppression and discrimination, she battled and spoke out against city leaders and police.  Her legacy lives among a people who’s future was transforming in front of their very eyes.  The Great Depression was a trying time for Americans.  Yet, it also produced leaders, like Tenayuca, who dedicated their lives to holding America and the American people accountable in “Order to form a more perfect union.”"],"display_date":"1932 - 1947","search_date":"1939-12-31","locations":[{"id":23160,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"Bexar, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1042,"tag":"Mexican-American"},{"id":1080,"tag":"Emma Tenayuca"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1082,"tag":"San Antonio, Texas"},{"id":1083,"tag":"San Antonio River Walk"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":1085,"tag":"WPA"},{"id":1086,"tag":"CCC"},{"id":1087,"tag":"AAA"},{"id":1088,"tag":"Worker's Alliance"},{"id":1089,"tag":"Unemployed Council"},{"id":1090,"tag":"strikes"},{"id":1091,"tag":"Dorothy Frock's Company"},{"id":1092,"tag":"Finck Cigar Company"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":6151,"title":"CCC construction was about more than just building a park","course_id":127,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/35","end_date":"12/31/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1935 the Civilian Conservation Corps began construction of a park on a portion of Chewacla Creek considered to be one of the most scenic areas in Auburn, Alabama.  A project history printed during park construction states that “2 ½ miles of park road has been constructed, into which numerous rock culverts were built.”  The document continues to describe construction of “an all masonry dam, containing six million pounds of rock.”  This was back-breaking work, performed without the aid of machinery using picks and shovels.  Construction of the dam would ultimately create a 27-acre lake providing fishing and recreation opportunities for the public.","The CCC project which created Chewacla State Park was typical of the multiuse natural resource management strategy of the prewar period, which provided recreation opportunities as well as erosion control and land restoration.  The CCC was active in Alabama between 1935 and 1942, employing 67,000 men. But CCC projects were about more than just the construction projects. Former Alabama State Legislator Pete Turnham, who worked on the Chewacla project, has said that \"the CCC built men and built communities, and it helped the nation by giving needy young men jobs by making money and getting a new start in life. They were the lifeblood of the country. It was an excellent opportunity for people.\"  Pete Turnham was typical of the men employed by the CCC. A member of CCC Camp Auburn SP-12, Turnahm was 18 when he joined CCC and worked on the Chewacla Park project in 1935.  He was paid $30 per month and was required to send a portion of that money home to support his family.  During the Great Depression era and the years leading up to World War II, the CCC helped to build men of character who would go on to become what has been called the greatest generation."],"display_date":"1935 - 1937","search_date":"1936-07-01","locations":[{"id":23925,"lat":32.605904939,"lng":-85.3493461098,"zoom":10,"place":"Lee, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2338,"tag":"Chewacla State Park"},{"id":1086,"tag":"CCC"}],"course":{"name":"Fundamentals of Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":127,"school_id":73}}]}
