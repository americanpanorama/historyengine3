Once home to an African princess, wed to a Spanish plantation owner, the home stands as a piece of living African American history.","Life for Anna Madgigine Jai was immensely different from the lives of most African slaves in the Americas. Purchased as a slave woman in Havana, Cuba by Zephaniah Kingsley at the age of 13, Anna was taken as her master’s wife and brought to East Florida, where she would eventually run plantations, operate businesses, and even own African slaves. As the supposed daughter of a ruling family in Senegal in West Africa, Anna went on to lead a royal lifestyle in Florida and to leave behind a legacy of strength and determination.","After her purchase at a slave market in Cuba, Zephaniah Kingsley- 30 years her senior- took Anna as his wife and brought her to his plantation, Laurel Grove, in then-Spanish East Florida, south of modern day Jacksonville. Anna’s life story provides a glimpse into the lives of the many African women who were enslaved in the New World and taken as wives by their masters. The practice of interracial marriage between slaves and Europeans was not uncommon in Spanish colonial times, as society was much more racially mixed than society in English colonies. The Spanish treated slaves more humanely than the French and the English, and gave them many chances to gain their freedom, allowed them to become full citizens after liberation, and frequently built families with Africans. In fact, the first free black town was formed in Spanish Florida.","Unlike her husband’s other, numerous slaves who lived in 32 tabby slave shacks, Anna Kingsley resided in the Laurel Grove’s main plantation house. In 1811, just five years after her purchase, Anna was unbound from the ties of slavery by her husband. By this time, the African princess had given birth to three of Zephaniah’s children: George, Martha, and Mary. The three mulatto offspring- of both African and European ancestry- were also freed by their Spanish father. The couple’s fourth child, John, was later born on Fort George Island.","Anna Kingsley survived enslavement, separation from her homeland and family, the “Middle Passage” across the Atlantic, purchase in Cuba, and a lifetime of struggle against expanding racist attitudes and laws in Florida. She raised four children who were constantly discriminated against for their mixed heritage, and, throughout her lifetime, policies regarding slavery and race in Florida underwent drastic changes that directly affected her life and her family. Her story is one of extreme difficulty, bravery, and endurance, but also of luxury unknown to the majority of Africans in the Americas.","Anna’s story carries on through the living history of her life on Fort George Island. The “White House of the Republic of Florida,” now called the “Princess House” after it’s historic owner, stands as evidence of Anna’s life and success on the beautiful isle."],"display_date":"January 1, 1855 - May 31, 1870","search_date":"1862-09-15","locations":[{"id":1435,"lat":30.6668452265,"lng":-81.5110477739,"zoom":9,"place":"NASSAU, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":449,"tag":"Anna Kingsley"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4849,"title":"From Eatonville to Broadway","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Born in Alabama and raised in Eatonville, Florida, Zora Neale Hurston became one of the greatest-known black female authors of all time. Zora once said:","\"I was born in a Negro town.  I do not mean by that the black backside of an average town.  Eatonville, Florida is, and was at the time of my birth, a pure Negro town-charter, mayor, council, town marshal and all.  It was not the first Negro community in America, but it was the first to be incorporated, the first attempt at organized self-government on the part of Negroes in America.\"","Zora’s life reflects the same “attempt” as did the formation and incorporation of Eatonville; she paved the way for all female writers in America, specifically those of African descent, through the strength of her own story.","Throughout history, Zora can often be found on the frontier of African American accomplishments. In 1927, she was the first African American to be admitted to Barnard College. After graduation, Zora immediately set out to explore “Negro” folklore. Through her strong determination and interest- and after only a few months- Zora had amassed the largest collection of “Negro” folk tales in her field. She used her extensive research into African American life and history to construct plays which recalled traditional “Negro folk-lore.” One such play is her famous <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, an adaptation of <em>The Great day</em>, a theatrical revue- a theatrical performance involving short satirical and topical songs, sketches, and monologues- written in 1932.","Zora frequently worked with Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida to construct and perform her creations. The concert program of “Negro music” for <em>The Great Day </em>was built through Zora’s collaborative effort with the creative literature department of Rollins College. The John Golden Theatre on Broadway housed the first performance of <em>The Great Day</em> on January 10, 1932- Zora had made it to Broadway. On February 11, 1933, she staged an adaptation of <em>The Great Day</em> called <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, “a program of original Negro folk-lore,” at Rollins College with “Native Negro Singers and Actors.” The event program included a brief biography about Zora Hurston, an outline of the play, and specific descriptions and explanations of each song included in the revue. At 8:15 pm, “Negroes” and “white friends of the Negroes” gathered at Rollins’ Recreation Hall to “experience the richness of the material at their own doorstep.” The play was a success, as many college and local newspaper write-ups from the period suggest, and Zora continued to display her creations at Rollins in front of captive audiences for years to come.","Though she fought and stood against racial prejudice throughout her life, Zora Neale Hurston stands as one of America’s most celebrated authors.  Zora’s creative path began in Eatonville, and by the mid 30s, it brought her to all the way to Broadway. Her story stands to tell: Zora indeed took her mother’s advice to “jump at de sun.\""],"display_date":"1910 - 1935","search_date":"1922-12-31","locations":[{"id":16531,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":129,"tag":"Eatonville"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4851,"title":"Zora Hurston: Making Folklore","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Zora Hurston grew up in Eatonville, Florida.

Hurston’s passion in learning black culture and folk life established her as a very unique and intelligent individual, whom was praised in the black community.  Although her views on racism were quite different from those in the black community, she was able to win over the hearts of many, despite her eccentric differences in thinking.  As she grew up she went to grammar school in Jacksonville and attended Morgan Academy in Baltimore, Maryland.  Hurston is well known as the first African American scholar to study folklore at the level she did, graduating from Barnard College, where she was the only black student, as well as attending graduate school at the ever so prestigious Columbia University.  At the time this was unheard of,  Rollins College was truly honored when she came and performed here on campus January 5, 1934.","The title of the performance was “All De Live Long Day.”  It was a folklore representation of black life in Florida at the time.  The program consisted of songs, plays, and dance.  Her words were every uplifting for blacks in a time of constant struggle for African Americans in Florida and the rest of the country.  Her songs were unique and related to real life experiences.  Hurston alongside many other African American’s were able to change the views of blacks in a unique and uplifting performance.  The performance was broken up into seven segments with an intermission in the middle.  Each segment had its own theme and the performance hit home all aspects of black life in America during the time of slavery.","Her research and ability to perform as well as she did, created her image as one of the most prolific African American women during the black’s struggle for freedom in the early 1930’s in America.  She gave blacks the ability to laugh and joke about life even in such drastic times.  Folklore was a very popular means of connecting African Americans, it was something they valued very highly.  It provided them with means of communication and brought them very close.  What Zora Hurston was able to do to African American culture was highly praised and provides great insight of how African Americans were able to adapt to the culture they underwent."],"display_date":"1930 - 1945","search_date":"1937-12-31","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":462,"tag":"African Folklore"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4874,"title":"Penders Advertisment","course_id":31,"status":"P","start_date":"12/20/33","end_date":"12/20/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Pender’s grocery advertisement from the Raleigh <em>Observer</em> depicted a wealthy and very happy white family enjoying a lovely Christmas dinner. The family is being served dinner by a maid, that also appeared to be in a good mood in the advertisement. This advertisement was an illustration of the menial work black women had to do in the 1930s. Domestic jobs were usually the most common types of work available to black women; depending on the location, domestic jobs were sometimes the only work available to black women. There were very few honorable employment opportunities available to black women, but a few black women were teachers or shop keepers, and some were able to do clerical work. Many times the more respectable jobs were only available to light skinned black women if they were available to black women at all. Regardless of the job description, black women were grossly underpaid for their work.","During the 1930s the American economy was at an all-time low, and the Great Depression was in full effect. The domestic job field became very competitive due to the poor economy; more women were seeking work as domestics, while those people who had maids discontinued their services. All of these factors drove down the already low wages. Domestic workers had to cook and clean after other families as well as their own, and just as portrayed in the advertisement, domestic workers spent their holidays cooking and serving their employers instead of being with their own loved ones.","Historian Jacqueline Jones has described the Great Migration, the time when many blacks moved to northern cities from 1900 to 1930 to find better jobs and opportunities.  According to Jones, the rumors of the north being a better place for blacks were only half true. There was a lot of immigration at the same time blacks were moving to northern cites; this made it hard for African Americans to get factory jobs because although blacks spoke English and were Protestant, the employers preferred to hire immigrants. Many black women were the bread winners of their households or their wages were close to that of their men. The black women moving north had hoped to escape domestic work because the progress of African Americans as a group was tied to the job status of black women. Black women eagerly sought factory jobs that offered more money for less working hours and did not have the social woes that came with domestic work. In the end, most black women were trapped in domestic service, but according to Jones black women measured their success by the standards of those still in the South. Life in the North was hard, but women rarely decided to move back south because in the North their children had better educational opportunities, and black women could also vote and participate in politics."," "],"display_date":"December 20, 1933","search_date":"1933-12-20","locations":[{"id":22391,"lat":35.7900765104,"lng":-78.6503526888,"zoom":9,"place":"Wake, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"African-American History from 1863 to the Present","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":31,"school_id":9}},{"id":4882,"title":"The Significance of Rhetoric in Antebellum America","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-01-01","end_date":"1839-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, held in Philadelphia May 1<sup>st</sup> through 3<sup>rd</sup> , 1839. This gathering was formed in such that African American women could come together and raise their voice for a cause that constantly rejected them. While slavery was still breaking the backs of black men and women in the South, Free Blacks in the North felt a duty and responsibility to promote and bring about emancipation. In a land where not only African-Americans, but women, were heavily exploited, finding ways to be heard had to be disconnected from faces that would be immediately shunned. As African American's at this time were believed to be ignorant and stupid, the movement to freedom inspired them to expand both their vocabulary and minds, which can be seen through the vast literary figures who emerged that this time. And so, rhetoric became essential, in both writing and speech. “Free Black churches, culturally specific jeremiads, slave narratives, secret schools, Black women's clubs, and Black colleges all represent an enriching merger of African American intellectual and activist concerns with writing instruction initiatives.”<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>"," ","The first day of the convention centered mostly about the immorality and inhumanity of the slave system. Religion was a huge factor for liberation, but this was not enough. African American's had to do more than prove that slavery was an act against God. On My 2<sup>nd</sup>, Elizabeth L. B. Stickney had a chance to make her statement. “Our principle, in regard prejudice against color, remains unchanged by persecution therefore... we will continue to act in accordance with out profession that the moral and intellectual character of a person... should mark the sphere in which they move. “ <sup><sup>2</sup></sup> Saying this, the means about which African American's became educated was easier in idea than"," ","in practice. Limited by resources, African American's had to learn at Black Colleges, Churches, and in their own homes. Though Slaves in southern plantations had earnest hearts and minds, their white","overseers oppressed them from most education except that which would help increase production. Free Blacks in the North were then given this civic duty. Though schools were available, many could not afford or attend them. Churches were popular, but they were in multitude and spread out. “African American's sought venues in which they could gain exposure to various subjects... as well as present their writing and oratory to critical audiences.”<sup><sup>3</sup></sup> As free African-American writers, poets, and intellectuals developed writings promoting sovereignty and could see how much their personal accounts and insights rallied people together, literary societies and conventions emerged."," ","“Place yourselves, dear friends, in our stead. We are blamed for not filling useful places in society; but give us light, give us learning, and see then what places we can occupy.”<sup><sup>4</sup></sup> Clarissa C. Lawrence from Massachusetts could not have stated this more accurately. It was not the African American that limited him or her self; in fact they were more than urgent to become integrated and educated. Sarah Douglass, a teacher and an active abolitionist from Philadelphia, appears under the minutes of the Convention as the treasurer. <sup><sup>5</sup></sup> Though she is not recorded as having spoken, only seven years earlier she gave an address before women of another literary society. As a writer, she used eloquent language stirring with passion to evoke sympathy from her audience. <sup><sup>6</sup></sup> All that occurred over those three days obviously cannot have been recorded within twelve pages, but regardless, her election as the convention's lone treasurer shows us the ideals and qualities likely held among most those who attended."," ","One of the final motions of the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women reads the following: “That we view... the efforts of young people to promote the abolition of slavery, not only because they have a tendency to improve the moral condition of mankind, but are also a stimulus to the exercise of those mighty energies of mind.”<sup><sup>7</sup></sup> In most cases, it is the youth who make the large pushes for social change. During antebellum before the American civil war, there was an explosion of emphasis on proper education and speech amongst the free African Americans of the North. With this came the multitude of schools and societies blacks had used to integrate the writings and works of their brothers and sisters. Many whites been the frontmen leading to abolition, but their sincerity could only be disconnected. If this period didn't have movements like the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women, who knows when, or even if slavery would have been abolished."," ","1 Gilyard, Keith<strong>. </strong><em>African American Contributions to Composition Studies </em>(National Council of Teachers of English: College Composition and Communication, 1999) , 626.","2<em> Proceedings of the third Anti-Slavery convention of American women held in Philadelphia, May 1st,</em><em>2nd and 3rd, 1839.

During her acceptance speech, Mo’Nique gave recognition to a woman who had won the same award seventy years earlier. She expressed her deepest admiration for this woman in these words: “I want to thank Miss Hattie McDaniel for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to.”","Seventy years earlier, at the 12<sup>th</sup> Academy Awards ceremony held in 1940, Hattie McDaniel won the award for best performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of “Mammy” in David O. Selznick’s production of <em>Gone with the Wind</em>. A win for any woman at these awards would not have been as notable as it was for Hattie McDaniel and the entire community of African Americans. McDaniel’s award marked the first win for African Americans in the history of motion pictures.","Although McDaniel’s role and film presence were vital in the story of the film, her presence was not always welcomed. When the film premiered in Atlanta, McDaniel was not permitted to attend the premiere alongside her white co-stars. Strict segregation laws in Georgia required that Hattie McDaniel enter through the back door and sit in the area reserved for blacks. Furthermore, the laws did not permit her to stay at the hotel where most of the cast was staying for the premiere. Rather than incite a disturbance, Hattie McDaniel chose not to attend.","Although she played her role of “Mammy” outstandingly, black activist groups vilified her and boycotted the film. They attacked her and her fellow black cast mates for accepting their roles in the film and charged that the portrayals of blacks in the film did little to assuage the white perception of blacks as loyal servants to whites. In the essay about the historical accuracy of the film <em>Gone with the Wind,</em> author Catherine Clinton, acknowledges that <em>Gone with the Wind</em> did not take into consideration the concerns about the treatment of blacks in the United States and adds that the portrayals of black characters in the film, “[rang] true to Hollywood’s typical betrayal of African Americans.”","As much as <em>Gone with the Wind</em> trivializes the work of blacks in film, it did make certain breakthroughs for non-white actors. Clinton explains that it was the first film to portray black actors in a “plantation style” setting where they did not spontaneously burst into song. It was also the first feature film to portray black characters as themselves instead of white actors in blackface. After her win, the minds of many of those who boycotted the film changed their minds and accepted that Hattie McDaniel’s choice to portray a mammy in a post-civil war period drama did indeed change the perception of blacks in film. In her acceptance speech, McDaniel thanked the Academy for their recognition of her craft. She further expresses her thanks and hopes for the future: “I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything I may be able to do in the future. I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry.”","Seventy years later, blacks are seen in roles that may not have been possible without Hattie McDaniel, but it is still considered a breakthrough in modern media for African Americans to be included.  It is now a matter of what roles they should choose to portray.  Hattie McDaniel made it possible for African Americans to take on roles in Hollywood, but most importantly, she gave them the ability to choose their roles."],"display_date":"February 29, 1940","search_date":"1940-02-29","locations":[{"id":27733,"lat":33.0342766311,"lng":-118.614221051,"zoom":8,"place":"Los Angeles, California"}],"tags":[{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":1040,"tag":"Academy Awards"},{"id":1041,"tag":"Film"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":6066,"title":"<strong>Contribution to Medicine</strong>","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-01-29","end_date":"1822-01-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 29<sup>th</sup>, 1822, Dr. Ebenezer Basset who was the town physician of Nassau, New York was abruptly interrupted by his medical assistant Jacob Kipp, who notified the doctor of their servant girl who was terribly ill.

Upon further examining the youth of fourteen, Dr. Basset noticed and began to uncover a fetus hidden underneath the snow. Dr. Basset was in complete shock at what he had just witnessed. To his amazement, the youth of fourteen had just conducted a cesarean section on herself.

Marion Sims started his day with his routine house-to-house calls in Montgomery, Alabama. Dr. Sims was a well-established and distinguished practitioner of medicine who came to Alabama from South Carolina to establish his own medical practice; he was also best known for his accomplishments in Women’s health and for the establishment of the first Women’s Hospital in the state of Alabama. While on his routine house call, he was notified by a friend that Mrs. Merrill, who was the wife of a prominent farmer, was terribly ill. Upon his arrival, Dr. J. Marion Sims described the situation at hand. ““She was in bed, complaining of great pain in her back, and a sense of tenesmus in both the bladder and rectum, the bearing down making her condition miserable”. Dr. Sims had to act fast on the female patient. Dr. Sims remembered two things while this emergency took place. First he remembered how much he “hated investigating the organs of the female pelvis”, and he also remembered his professor Dr. Prioleau of the Charleston Medical College, who said, “Gentlemen, if any of you are ever called to a case of sudden version of the uterus backward, you must place the patient on the knees and elbows-in a genu-pectoral position- and then introduce one finger into the rectum and another into the vagina, and push up, and pull down”. After executing protocol, Dr. Sims knew ultimately he had to get the uterus in position by using this method prescribed above. Mrs. Merrill was screaming from the top of her lungs as Dr. Sims still hand deep in her vagina pushed his hand toward the lady’s uterus wall and turned his hand upward and downward pushing with all his might until he could no longer feel her uterus or her womb. Mrs. Merrill enduring all of this pain suddenly said “Why, doctor, I am relived.” Just then as Mrs. Merrill was about to lie down on her back, she let out an explosion. Mrs. Merrill was speechless and bashful, but Dr. Sims knew this escape of gas was not from the bowel, but from the vagina. Dr. Sims had a revelation. He thought if the pressure in the vagina could be released in a certain way by the positioning of the body and other methods, he may have an explanation for a possible cure for vesico-vaginal fistula.","Vesico-vaginal fistula is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the bladder and the vagina that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of urine into the vaginal vault. This abnormality is caused by complications in child births or other extreme causes. This female abnormality was very common and Dr. Sims was the leading doctor who experimented, tested, and always tried to seek a solution for this occurrence. His main subjects or guinea pigs were often on African American women. His leading test subject was a slave by the name of Betsy who suffered from this complication. Once the complication was solved for the first time on Mrs. Merrill, Dr. Sims immediately went to his test subject Betsy and performed an operation to heal her infirmities. Throughout the years Dr. J. Marion Sims overcame many medical feats and saved a countless number of women through his expertise, but he is sometimes viewed as a bad guy. According to Dr. L. L. Wall who wrote in The Journal of Medical Ethics, we see that there are some who defend his surgical practice. “Modern critics have discounted the enormous suffering experienced by fistula victims, have ignored the controversies that surrounded the introduction of anesthesia into surgical practice in the middle of the 19th century, and have consistently misrepresented the historical record in their attacks on Sims.” Dr. Wall acknowledges that Dr. Sims used enslaved African Americans as his guinea pigs, but it was not because they were vulnerable, it was due to the incredible suffering they endured on a constant basis. Dr. Sims was the only physician who had an alternative to their pains."],"display_date":"January 10, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-10","locations":[{"id":298,"lat":32.2469172256,"lng":-86.1720796894,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":2192,"tag":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}}]}
