His proposal had a long and controversial life. During an attempt to pass the bill in 1848, Senator Thomas Corwin, a Whig from Ohio, stood up before the Senate and gave his arguments against the piece of legislation. Senator Corwin opposed slavery. At one point, he stated that if there were a country so hot “the white man is supposed not to be able to work, I would not allow you to take slaves there.” Yet he still strongly opposed the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the amendment was unnecessary, because slavery already existed in some form in the new territories. The senator referred to land expansions in his argument, saying, “if at any time…you have acquired territory where Slavery existed in such form and consistency…it has been permitted to remain where by law it did exist.” Despite being staunchly antislavery, he paradoxically fought against this bill. Senator Corwin had another motive behind his protest of the bill. He saw that the Proviso was just causing another Sectional Crisis and dividing Congress. Corwin opposed it because he, like many at the time, feared that it would lead to southern secession. His speech was an attempt to prevent this eventuality from happening.","The Wilmot Proviso quickly became controversial in Congress, and in some cases, it was for reasons other than slavery. Historian James McPherson writes that there were some southerners who opposed it because they saw “the northern effort to exclude it [slavery] as an insult to southern honor.” The Wilmot Proviso, as this amendment came to be called, passed in the House on two separate occasions, and both times the Senate voted it down. The country was already divided by a series of Sectional Crises, and the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso only exacerbated the problem. Historian Eric Foner called it “the beginning of a path which led almost inevitably to sectional controversy and civil war.” Corwin claimed that there was no way the proviso could possibly lead to that eventuality, but his actions say otherwise. In March of 1861, he proposed an amendment known as the “Corwin Amendment” that would have made it illegal for Congress to amend the Constitution to restrict slavery. The Corwin Amendment was the senator’s attempt to placate the South and prevent them from seceding. He saw how polarizing the Wilmot Proviso was. Corwin opposed it not because he supported slavery, but because he wanted to keep the United States a whole nation. He debated in vain, and the Proviso continued to divide the North and the South."],"display_date":"August 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-08-25","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1801,"tag":"Wilmot Proviso"},{"id":1802,"tag":"Mexican War"},{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6863,"title":"Daniel Webster Refutes Robert Hayne's Attack on New England in the Great Senate Debate of 1830","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-26","end_date":"1830-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 26 and 27, 1830, senators Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts got into a heated debate that captured many of the issues that threatened to tear the nation apart. The main issues involved the tariff and nullification. Two days prior to Webster’s reply, Hayne delivered a speech in Congress that attacked Webster by questioning his loyalty to the Constitution. In this speech, Hayne said that the South had \"everything to lose and nothing to gain.\" He believed the tariff only sought \"the protection of Northern shipping and New England seamen\" while the South reaped no benefits. The audience expected Webster to deliver a reply, and he did not let them down. Webster began his reply by saying, “…It is, Sir, the people’s Constitution, the people’s government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people.” Throughout the course of this reply, Webster argued that the federal government provided everything for the country. He stated that the sectional conflict resulted from the claims of state’s rights since the state governments tried to insert themselves into the areas recognized as the purview of the federal government.","Sectional beliefs divided the Senate which emphasized the tensions between the North and the South. At this point, the southern states felt that the federal government violated their rights by imposing the tariff. Robert Hayne advocated for states’ rights. According to Harlow W. Sheidley, he also proposed the doctrine of nullification in which a state could nullify laws that they considered unconstitutional like the tariff. This served as a pretext to the Nullification Crisis that would cause South Carolina to threaten secession. In Webster’s reply to Hayne, he argued that the southern states secede since the Constitution applies to both the North and the South. This debate brought into question the limits of what the federal government could do.","Webster’s reply to Hayne revealed his sense of federalism. His counterargument suggests that he saw a common identity as a country, not just North and South. Clearly, Webster tried to promote federalism over sectionalism. In his reply to Hayne, he implicitly stated his belief that the Constitution created the framework of the federal government. Webster believed that the federal government had the right to handle any conflict between the state and federal governments over an issue not clarified in the Preamble of the US Constitution. This explains his opposition to nullification, which justifies why he argued that states such as South Carolina had no right to nullify the tariff.  A century later, Senator Robert C. Byrd recognized that Webster knew how to appeal to a national audience during a time of governmental polarization. He also knew how to diffuse a situation by changing the subject. And because he possessed this knowledge, he decided to persuade people of the importance of a single democratic union. However, many southerners fully opposed these beliefs. Therefore, Daniel Webster’s reply to Hayne embodies the true sectional crisis that eventually leads to the American Civil War."],"display_date":"January 26, 1830 - January 27, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-26","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.898899496695,"lng":-77.032655531551,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"},{"id":150,"tag":"Senate"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":371,"tag":"Debate"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
