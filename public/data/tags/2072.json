She recalls that she was a \"great walker\" because her home was centrally located to her community, including a \"hop skip and a jump\" to flower shops, family grocers, Barthwell's Ice Cream Parlor, shoe repair shops, and more. She recalls that neighbors kept an eye on each other and their children, including her, creating a strong sense of unity in raising the community.","Teola P. Hunter, who lived on Medbury Ave., recalls not only being born into a wonderful family, but also \"born into a neighborhood\". She notes that her friends and family were people who were \"poor but proud\" and determined to live their lives to the fullest. Often, her \"family\" was not real family at all as almost everyone on the block was lovingly claimed to be one of her cousins. She also accounts how familiies would often hold \"credit account(s)\" with stores and other businesses in the community so they could get items like groceries in between paydays or if they ran out.","George D. Ramsey, Sr., grew up in a flat at 952 E. Warren Ave, between Hastings and Rivard. He recalls his 18 years of childhood there as his \"Street of Dreams\". He fondly remembers childhood mischiefs, such as peeping through the windows of Cole Funeral Home to look at the bodies, sitting of the porch of noted jazz pianist Will Davis, and jumping across rooftops at the \"Booker T.\" apartment complex. He recalls \"death and despair\" always being present though, like visiting the Astoria Bar where police once shot a man and blood stained the street until next rainfall. Still, living next to a Do Wopp group, musical greatness, and a lively community showed George that great things could be realized in his neighborhood, and he always felt satisfied.","The above accounts are just a few of the many stories shared about the communal spirit of growing up in Black Bottom. There is often the saying that \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and that this held true in Detroit's Eastside. Many previous residents will similiarly reminisice on living with \"aunts\" & \"uncles\" that weren't biologically related, neighbors reprimanding other children as if they were their own, and feeling safe walking alone down the street, even for women at night. These residents knew they were poor, but almost all of them recall never feeling poor or middle class. Within the confines of their neighborhood, many as sheltered children recall feeling rich, and as if they had everything they needed in the world (despite the area having poor environmental conditions such as disease, poverty, and poor safety in housing). Moreover, there are a large amount of documented stories and photographs on the thriving economics of Hastings Street, to which so many residental streets turned off of. Theaters, Black-owned businesses, barborshops, and dime stores, were among many of the attractions along the street. Combined with Paradise Valley next door, it has been often said that neighborhoods of Black Detroit, like Black Bottom, were \"a city within a city\", created by the heavy segregation of the time.","Environmental racism predominantly includes creating the inequal distribution and equality of space, which ultimately defines where and how people live. So while it can be polarizing and destructive (such as between Whites and Blacks within Detroit), Black Bottom and the Black community of Detroit also show how hope can be created within such defined space. Finally, they show how injustly forcing people into a certain situation can bring them closer as a united community - an important revelation for almost all areas of history and stories of oppression."],"display_date":"1935 - 1960","search_date":"1948-01-01","locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1990,"tag":"Hastings Street, Detroit"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":1954,"tag":"Black Bottom Detroit"},{"id":2072,"tag":"Environmental Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6012,"title":"Zug Island: Environmental Problems Then and Now","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-11-21","end_date":"1897-11-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zug Island, a privately-owned industrial site located at the junction of the Detroit and Rouge Rivers, is one of the many industrial eyesores for the nearby community of Delray in the southwest of Detroit. The usual appeal of an island is absent as this industry-heavy land mass spews pollution into the air and water. In 1897, Zug Island was already beginning to cause trouble for the surrounding residents, and an article in the <em>Detroit Free Press </em>raised the first of many environmental concerns about the activities there. The reporter describes a large fire on Zug Island with ash debris that was carried throughout the city. Down the River Rouge, the “air was full of dust.”","We might assume that in our more environmentally-conscious era a mishap on this scale would go far beyond a 100-word news article in the paper. However that assumption would be incorrect: in 2011 the same newspaper reported that a bone-shaking hum, affecting not only Delray residents but also Canadians on the other side of the river, was the result of unknown actions taking place on Zug Island.","The comparison of these two events reflects the ongoing lack of oversight of the activities on Zug Island. Moreover it begins to shed light on an issue far greater than the fire itself. With problems like this continuing into the our times it becomes almost explicitly how facilities like Zug Island were placed by neighborhoods with low populations with little pull or leverage over large companies that owned Zug. These large companies saw the environment around Zug as the perfect place for running their factories without consequences.","While at times it may seem like a conspiratorial stretch it would appear that these two instances would fit nicely into concepts of environmental racism. Industrial pollution is routinely concentrated in areas where poorer and browner populations are the worst exposed. Factories along with their hazards are not being placed in white or suburban neighborhoods due to systemic white privilege. This white privilege allows people in more affluent areas to inhabit cleaner environments. Places like Delray, with its large immigrant population, are often the victims of industry's many environmental offenses.","In 1897, investors and public officials sanctioned high levels of contamination from Zug Island because of their interest in promoting industry. In 2011, as the island continued to have serious adverse effects on those who surrounded it, there still seemed to be no way to determine who was responsible or had jurisdiction over the industrial center. Whether spewing ash and fire over the city, or emitting small tremors that cross national borders, Zug Island continues to spread problems without concern for its neighbors and their well-being."],"display_date":"November 21, 1897","search_date":"1897-11-21","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2054,"tag":"Zug Island"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":2072,"tag":"Environmental Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6553,"title":"War on Warren County","course_id":155,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/82","end_date":"10/30/82","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was the summer of 1982 in Warren County, North Carolina. The asphalt burned their skin through their clothes as they lay in the street waiting for the trucks to arrive. All of the protests from that summer had led to this moment, residents and activists, black and white, laying their lives down to protect their environment. The trucks were arriving to dump the PCB-laden soil into the backyard of the folks living in Warren County. They may not have prevented the “poisoning of [their] communities and land,” but they would not go down without one final battle.","The residents of Warren County were fighting for their “fundamental right to clean air, land, water, and food” by employing tactics from the Civil Rights Movement. The Warren County people of color banded together with white people and past civil rights activists to ignite a new movement: environmental justice for all. African Americans could no longer ignore the environmental racism they had witnessed for so many years, so they took action to “fight the destruction and taking of [their] land and communities.” African Americans had been the “victims of environmental injustice” for too long.","Warren County was chosen as a site for toxic waste due to its relatively small, rural population. However, the population was also very impoverished and mostly African American. The Warren County residents did not passively allow the state government to dump the toxic waste in their backyard. However, “the community was politically and economically unempowered.” The Warren County Citizens Concerned group “countered ‘facts’ from the state and the EPA” due to concerns about future water contamination and the decimation of the local economy. Despite the contested research, the government continued with the project and constructed the landfill. The impoverished residents of Warren County became “victims of environmental injustice,” but their story served as a stimulus of the environmental justice movement."," "],"display_date":"August 1, 1982 - October 30, 1982","search_date":"1982-09-15","locations":[{"id":52938,"lat":36.4352131,"lng":-78.0195387,"zoom":6,"place":"Warren County, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3058,"tag":"PCBs"},{"id":3057,"tag":"toxic waste"},{"id":2072,"tag":"Environmental Racism"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":2092,"tag":"Environmental Justice"}],"course":{"name":"HIST 3550, American Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":155,"school_id":73}}]}
