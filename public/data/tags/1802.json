His proposal had a long and controversial life. During an attempt to pass the bill in 1848, Senator Thomas Corwin, a Whig from Ohio, stood up before the Senate and gave his arguments against the piece of legislation. Senator Corwin opposed slavery. At one point, he stated that if there were a country so hot “the white man is supposed not to be able to work, I would not allow you to take slaves there.” Yet he still strongly opposed the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the amendment was unnecessary, because slavery already existed in some form in the new territories. The senator referred to land expansions in his argument, saying, “if at any time…you have acquired territory where Slavery existed in such form and consistency…it has been permitted to remain where by law it did exist.” Despite being staunchly antislavery, he paradoxically fought against this bill. Senator Corwin had another motive behind his protest of the bill. He saw that the Proviso was just causing another Sectional Crisis and dividing Congress. Corwin opposed it because he, like many at the time, feared that it would lead to southern secession. His speech was an attempt to prevent this eventuality from happening.","The Wilmot Proviso quickly became controversial in Congress, and in some cases, it was for reasons other than slavery. Historian James McPherson writes that there were some southerners who opposed it because they saw “the northern effort to exclude it [slavery] as an insult to southern honor.” The Wilmot Proviso, as this amendment came to be called, passed in the House on two separate occasions, and both times the Senate voted it down. The country was already divided by a series of Sectional Crises, and the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso only exacerbated the problem. Historian Eric Foner called it “the beginning of a path which led almost inevitably to sectional controversy and civil war.” Corwin claimed that there was no way the proviso could possibly lead to that eventuality, but his actions say otherwise. In March of 1861, he proposed an amendment known as the “Corwin Amendment” that would have made it illegal for Congress to amend the Constitution to restrict slavery. The Corwin Amendment was the senator’s attempt to placate the South and prevent them from seceding. He saw how polarizing the Wilmot Proviso was. Corwin opposed it not because he supported slavery, but because he wanted to keep the United States a whole nation. He debated in vain, and the Proviso continued to divide the North and the South."],"display_date":"August 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-08-25","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1801,"tag":"Wilmot Proviso"},{"id":1802,"tag":"Mexican War"},{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6196,"title":"<strong>A Pennsylvania soldier sails to the Mexican War</strong>","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-29","end_date":"1847-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 29, 1847 James Skelly and the Cambria Guards embarked on the <em>General Veazie</em> in New Orleans during the Mexican War.  Rainy weather had played a continuous role in delaying the men from reaching port.  According to Skelly “owing to the Rain and we were Prohibited” resulted in another delay from sailing.  Several days later the ship finally made her way into the Gulf of Mexico.  James Skelly of Cambria County, Pennsylvania had enlisted with the Cambria Guards and kept a diary of what he experienced during part of the Mexican War.  Unbeknownst to Skelly, he would not only fight the Mexicans, but also small pox and sea sickness.","Skelly left Cambria County with the Cambria Guards on January 2 and traveled on steam boats down the Ohio and Mississippi River to New Orleans.  This expedition included the famous Lt. Col. John W. Geary of the American Highlanders.  The United States had declared war on Mexico the previous spring on May 13, 1846 and needed six Pennsylvania regiments to fill their quota to fight the war.","Life in the Pennsylvania mountains for Skelly differed greatly than life onboard a ship.  Cramped spaces, briny spray, and the vessel rocking back and forth during heavy sea states resulted in Skelly getting sea sick.  To make matters worse, an outbreak of small pox occurred on February 10.","Bad luck with the weather continued periodically throughout the next week causing more delays, which resulted in flared tempers amongst the soldiers and crew.  Skelly wrote that one of the crew even “choked the first mate who had stollen a barrel of our crackers.”  Some of the soldiers also began fighting amongst themselves, due to flared tempers caused by stressful living conditions.","Skelly and his fellow soldiers finally disembarked at Lobos Island, near Puerto Rico, on March 3 after being onboard for over a month.  The soldiers had to stay at Lobos Island in order to quarantine the small pox outbreak.  Skelly did not write in his diary whether he ever contracted smallpox but regardless, the entire group had to be quarantined.  Diseases, such as smallpox, usually claimed more lives in early American wars than actual combat.  Amazingly, everyone infected recovered, which could possibly mean they had contracted a pox disease other than smallpox.","They set sail on the <em>General Veazie</em> once more for the Mexican mainland on April 9.  Instead of fighting small pox and sea sickness, Skelly now faced the task of fighting the Mexicans until the following spring when the war ended in May, 1848."," "],"display_date":"January 29, 1847 - March 3, 1847","search_date":"1847-02-14","locations":[{"id":52575,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"},{"id":10897,"lat":40.4954308749,"lng":-78.7136040605,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMBRIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":2407,"tag":"General Veazie"},{"id":2406,"tag":"sea sick"},{"id":2405,"tag":"small pox"},{"id":1802,"tag":"Mexican War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}}]}
