Such factors include creating a balance between agrarian and industrial economic profit, establishing a sustainable political atmosphere, and moving towards development that would place the South in equal ranks with the North in terms of industrialization and productivity. Despite this overall sentiment to rebuild the region, certain aspects of the New South’s society were harder to establish than others. In particular, politics of the 1880’s and the 1890’s caused numerous setbacks due to the extreme partisanship, internal corruption within each party, and the competitive nature of elections.","Winter Park, Florida had effectively settled itself in terms of generating economic profit for the town, creating a pleasurable lifestyle for its residents and guests, as well as establishing a stable political environment. Various hotels such as the Seminole advertised sunshine as the key to escaping the unbearable winter months in the North as well as advertising its luxurious and spacious atmosphere. Labor was needed to provide for the flock of Northerners, so recently freed black citizens were encouraged to move to Winter Park as a place to live and work.[1] This influx of tourists created large economic profits for Winter Park, and thus caused other industries began to evolve as well. Despite the inclusion of black citizens into the town, social tensions did remain throughout the South, but the political upset are discussed in more detail in this article.","“A Quiet Election” provides an inside look into this stable political setting that is unusual compared to the rest of the South. In July of 1893, one ticket or platform ran for Town Council positions of mayor, marshal, collector, treasurer, and clerk, but these men did not have an opposing force to campaign against.[2] Florida has a history of political transformation especially after the Spanish-American War, in which the United States gained large territories in the Southwest region. Sectionalism and the later argument of secession created divisions among Floridians, so the political atmosphere of this state was, contrary to what “A Quiet Election” illustrates, composed of several different affiliations.[3] Further, the two-party system existed when Florida was admitted to the Union in 1848.[4] As a result, the continued competitive nature between the two major parties, as well as smaller third party organizations, made up the political culture within Florida. The book <em>The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction </em>provides description of the standard regional Southern politics of the 1890’s: The Civil War and Reconstruction created a two-party system that transformed into a two-region system, with the North being mostly Republicans and the South being mostly Democrats.[5] Political parties were not mentioned and rather the article, “A Quiet Election,” only discusses information concerning the homes and reputations of the men elected. With this new round of officials, the newspaper ends on a progressive and positive note, “[A]nd now things are moving on. For them, we hope success.”[6]","In conclusion, the standard political aspects of the 1890’s in Florida as well as the majority of the South included severe party loyalty and an overarching theme of competition between the two major parties. Despite this fact, Winter Park seems to experience a completely different political landscape as illustrated by the City Council election of July 1893. One ticket of men ran for office and thus were elected. The article did not mention their party affiliations and instead discussed their relationships to the Winter Park community with an encouraging outlook for continued progress and industrialization of the town."],"display_date":"July 8, 1893","search_date":"1893-07-08","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2330,"tag":"Election 1893"},{"id":2329,"tag":"1890s"},{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"},{"id":1495,"tag":"Winter Park"},{"id":1444,"tag":"American Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6207,"title":"Prelude to War: American Government After the Embargo","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1809-03-24","end_date":"1809-03-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gurdon S. Mumford most likely wore his finest on the May 24, 1809, as it was the day he was sworn into the House of Representatives. While this may have been the most significant event for Mumford, Laban Wheaton--a seasoned representative and Federalist from Massachusetts--knew there were matters of state to be addressed on that day. Two petitions were redirected to the Committee of Commerce and Manufacturers, and Wheaton listened as members of the House propose amendments to their actions on previous days. Virginia Federalist John Randolf then moved “to immediately disband” military units that had been authorized on April 12 in a bill entitled “An Act to Raise, for a Limited Time, an Additional Military Force”. Randolph also moved that \"the funds be redirected towards the pre-existing military in order to [arm] and [equip] the whole body of the militia of the United States.” Randolf also sought to appoint a committee to look into whether or not money taken from the Treasury had been used in the way the House had directed. Randolph's multipart motion was unanimously affirmed. Then many representatives began to fuss over the specificities of the motion, however the House was able to, again, agree on passing it. At the end of the day, the House adjourned until the following morning at ten o’clock.","While many of the votes taken that day were unanimous, the last was not. Laban Wheaton voted against the final motion of the day, and his vote illustrated both the platform of the Federalist Party, and the tensions in Congress between attempting to maintain good relations with Britain and upholding the sovereignty of the relatively new United States.","History Jeffrey A. Frankel’s article has noted that the 1807-1809 Embargo against Great Britain had many shortcomings, ultimately it failed, and did more harm to the United States it helped the nation either financially or politically. By May 24, 1809, the embargo had been lifted, but the nation faced an economic downturn brought on by the embargo. And the House discussion of troops and funds illustrated ongoing indecision within the government of the early republic regarding the potential of international warfare with England."," "],"display_date":"March 24, 1809","search_date":"1809-03-24","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2493,"tag":"Embargo of 1807"},{"id":1782,"tag":"US Government"},{"id":370,"tag":"Federalist"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":1444,"tag":"American Politics"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}}]}
